'''Den Brook Wind Farm''' is a proposed [[windfarm]] in [[Devon]], [[England]]. The windfarm will be located {{convert|2|km}} south-east of [[North Tawton]] and {{convert|2.5|km}} south-west of [[Bow, Devon|Bow]], and will comprise nine [[wind turbine]]s, each {{convert|120|m}} high. Developer [[Renewable Energy Systems]] (RES) received [[planning consent]] for the project in December 2009,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.den-brook.co.uk/media/16981/RES%20WELCOMES%20APPROVAL%20OF%20DEN%20BROOK%20WIND%20FARM_111209final.pdf |title=RES welcomes approval of Den Brook Wind Farm |publisher=RES |date=11 December 2011}}</ref> following a long planning process which included two [[public inquiry|public inquiries]] and a [[judicial review]]. 

RES initially put forward proposals for a windfarm at Den Brook in 2004, and in response the Den Brook Valley Action Group was established to oppose the plan. A key concern was the potential impact of noise on local residents. In 2006, [[West Devon|West Devon Borough Council]] refused planning permission for the scheme, but RES appealed, and consent was granted in early 2007 following a public inquiry. Still concerned about noise issues, local residents the formed Den Brook Judicial Review Group which pursued a judicial appeal. This resulted in the inquiry decision being overturned, and a second public inquiry was held in October 2009, following which permission was once more granted, subject to a number of planning conditions. A second legal challenge was rejected in August 2010.<ref name=bbcaug2010>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-devon-11029757 |title=Den Brook wind turbine challenge rejected by High Court |publisher=BBC News |date=19 August 2010}}</ref> In 2011, the windfarm was the subject of a television documentary series, ''Windfarm Wars'', broadcast by [[BBC Two]], which followed the history of the project.<ref name=windfarmwars>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00zzwv6 |title=Windfarm Wars|publisher=BBC Television |accessdate=1 June 2011 }}</ref>

==Planning history==
RES initially publicised two alternate proposals for Den Brook in 2004: a scheme of ten {{convert|100|m|adj=on}} turbines; and a scheme of 19 {{convert|80|m|adj=on}} turbines. Following consultation, a layout of nine {{convert|120|m|adj=on}} turbines was developed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.den-brook.co.uk/about-the-project/project-layout-infrastructure.aspx |title=Project Layout and infrastructure |work=Den Brook Wind Farm |publisher=RES |accessdate=9 June 2011}}</ref> Also in 2004, RES erected an [[anemometer]] mast to measure wind speed, and undertook [[background noise]] monitoring.<ref name=storysofar>{{cite web |url=http://www.denbrookvalley.co.uk/3.html |title=The Story so Far... |publisher=Den Brook Judicial Review Group |accessdate=9 June 2011}}</ref>  

===Planning application===
By April 2005, Den Brook Valley Action Group (DBVAG) had been formed, and was flying a balloon at the site to mark the height of the proposed turbines.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/devon/4496321.stm |title=Balloon shows wind turbine height |publisher=BBC News |date=29 April 2005}}</ref> The planning application was submitted to West Devon Borough Council (WDBC) in November 2005.<ref name=application>{{cite web |url=http://www.westdevon.gov.uk/PlanningApplicationSearch/Disclaimer.aspx?PlanningID=8250%2f2005%2fOKE |title=Planning Application 8250/2005/OKE |publisher=West Devon Borough Council |accessdate=9 June 2011}}</ref> Objections to the proposal came from the [[Campaign to Protect Rural England]], [[Mid Devon|Mid Devon District Council]], and from 2,915 objection letters, all citing grounds including visual impact, noise, and residential amenity.<ref name=WDBCreport>{{cite web |url=http://www.westdevon.gov.uk/upload/public/attachments/500/oke%20apps%283%29.pdf |publisher=West Devon Borough Council |date=31 January 2006 |title=Planning & Licensing Committee: Planning Applications and Enforcement Reports (Northern Area)}}</ref> [[Dartmoor National Park]] and the [[Dartmoor Preservation Association]] also objected, as the site is located around {{convert|5.5|km}} from the national park boundary.<ref name=WDBCreport/> 71 letters of support were also received.<ref name=WDBCreport/> WDBC planning officers recommended refusal of planning permission, on the grounds of visual impacts, and potential impacts on the historic environment.<ref name=WDBCreport/> On 31 January 2006 the council voted to accept the recommendation, and refused planning permission.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/devon/4666562.stm |title=Windfarm plan refused by council  |publisher=BBC News |date=31 January 2006 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.res-group.com/media/230761/den%20brook%20decision.pdf |title=Den Brook decision: a missed opportunity to take positive action on climate change |publisher=RES |date=31 January 2006}}</ref>

Four months later, RES announced their intention to appeal to the [[Planning Inspectorate]] against the decision, and to seek a [[public inquiry]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.res-group.com/media/230757/den%20brook%20appeal%20announcement%20300506.pdf |title=RES to appeal Den Brook Wind Farm decision |date=30 May 2006 |publisher=RES}}</ref> The inquiry was held in November 2006, at which the appeal was opposed by representatives of WDBC and DBVAG. In February 2007 the appeal was allowed by the planning inspector, and planning permission granted.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/devon/6353869.stm |title=Green light for appeal wind farm   |publisher=BBC News |date=12 February 2007 }}</ref>

===Judicial review===
In March 2007, the Den Brook Judicial Review Group (DBJRG) was formed by local residents. Headed by Mike Hulme, whose property was one of the closest dwellings to the proposed site, the group came together over concerns regarding the potential for [[noise pollution]] from the turbines.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.denbrookvalley.co.uk/2.html |title=Den Brook Judicial Review Group: Who we are |publisher=Den Brook Judicial Review Group |accessdate=10 June 2011}}</ref> A key concern was the potential for sleep disturbance due to a phenomenon known as amplitude modulation. This form of noise, which has been reported at a small number of windfarm sites, is poorly understood.<ref>{{cite web |author=Bowdler, Dick |title=Amplitude modulation of wind turbine noise: a review of the evidence |date=June 2008 |publisher=Industrial Wind Action Group }}</ref>

DBJRG launched an appeal, under Section 288 of the [[Town and Country Planning Act 1990]], to the [[High Court of Justice |High Court]], which was heard in March 2008 by Justice Mitting. A key issue was the refusal of RES to release the background noise data to Mr Hulme, to allow independent analysis. Although he criticised the approach taken by RES, Justice Mitting refused to overturn the result of the inquiry, since the planning inspector had not made a legal error in coming to his decision.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.denbrookvalley.co.uk/resources/High+Court+Action.pdf |title=Fresh Legal Appeal Launched Against Den Brook Wind Farm |date=March 2008 |publisher=Den Brook Judicial Review Group }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Hulme, R (on the application of) v Secretary of State for Communities & Local Government (2008) EWHC 637 (Admin) |date=19 March 2008 |url=http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2008/637.html}}</ref> In May, RES released the noise data, and errors were subsequently discovered by DBJRG,<ref name=furtherinformation>{{cite web |url=http://www.denbrookvalley.co.uk/resources/PressRelease_03082008.pdf |title=Den Brook Valley Wind Farm Judicial Review Information: Further Information |date=3 August 2008 |publisher=Den Brook Judicial Review Group }}</ref> although RES denied that they were significant.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.den-brook.co.uk/media/51577/den%20brook%20wind%20farm%20will%20not%20cause%20noise%20nuisance%20july%202008.pdf |title=Res reassures residents that Den Brook Wind Farm will not cause a noise nuisance |date=9 July 2008 |publisher=RES}}</ref> DBJRG then took their case to the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]], and permission to appeal was granted in June 2008.<ref name=storysofar/> To avoid the need for another court hearing a [[consent decree|consent order]] was agreed between DBJRG and the [[Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government]] (the defendant in the case), which had the effect of overturning the planning inquiry, and returning the matter to the Planning Inspectorate.<ref name=furtherinformation/> 

===Second public inquiry===
The second public inquiry was initially scheduled for March 2009, but was postponed at the request of DBJRG, who had not then had sufficient time to review new noise data supplied by RES.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.denbrookvalley.co.uk/resources/Press+Release+Feb+2009.pdf |title=Den Brook Wind Farm: Second Public Inquiry Postponed |date=nd. |publisher=Den Brook Judicial Review Group }}</ref> The inquiry took place between July and October 2009, with the appeal being opposed by WDBC, DBJRG, and the Campaign to Protect Rural England.<ref name=decision>{{cite web |url=http://www.denbrookvalley.co.uk/resources/Denbrook+APPEAL+DECISION-1.pdf |title=Appeal Decision: Appeal Ref: APP/Q1153/A/06/2017162, Land to the south east of North Tawton and the south west of Bow |publisher=The Planning inspectorate |date=11 December 2009}}</ref> The appeal was once again allowed in December 2009. A number of planning conditions were attached by the inspector, aimed at reducing the likelihood of noise nuisance.<ref name=decision/>

Following the decision, a second judicial appeal was launched by Mike Hulme, which challenged the validity of the planning conditions and claimed that the wording of the noise conditions rendered them ineffective.<ref name=bbcaug2010/> The case was heard by Judge Frances Patterson [[QC]] in July 2010. All ten grounds of the challenge were rejected by the judge in her decision.<ref>{{cite web |title=Hulme, R (on the application of) v Secretary of State for Communities & Local Government (2010) EWHC 2386 (Admin) |date=19 August 2010 |url=http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2010/2386.html}}</ref> Hulme went on to lodge an appeal against this decision, which was dismissed by the Court of Appeal in May 2011.<ref>{{cite web |title=Hulme v Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government & Anor (2011) EWCA Civ 638 |date=26 May 2011 |url=http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2011/638.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.denbrookvalley.co.uk/index.html |title=Court of Appeal Judgement |date=1 June 2011 |publisher=Den Brook Judicial Review Group}}</ref> Meanwhile, RES have been seeking agreement with WDBC on how the planning conditions will be met.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.den-brook.co.uk/about-the-project/site-progress.aspx |title=Site Progress |publisher=RES |accessdate=10 June 2011}}</ref> 

==''Windfarm Wars''==
The [[BBC]] commissioned a documentary on the development of Den Brook Wind Farm shortly after the inception of the project.<ref name=Gibson>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/tv/2011/05/windfarm-wars.shtml |title=Windfarm Wars: Filming the renewable energy debate in Devon |date=24 May 2011 |author=Gibson, Jeremy |work=BBC TV Blog |publisher=BBC Television}}</ref> Including face-to-face interviews with a number individuals concerned with the windfarm, it focused primarily on Rachel Ruffle, project manager for RES, and Mike Hulme, local resident and member of DBJRG. Initially conceived as a single film, it developed into a series as the planning process became more and more protracted. The timescale also consumed most of the programme budget, with producer Jeremy Gibson eventally completing the films as a solo project.<ref name=Gibson/> The series was first broadcast in May and June 2011.<ref name=windfarmwars/>
