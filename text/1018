The '''Armed Forces Memorial''' is a national [[memorial]] in the [[United Kingdom]], dedicated to the 16,000 servicemen and women of the [[British Armed Forces]] killed on duty or through [[terrorism|terrorist]] action since the [[Second World War]].

==History==
The creation of a national memorial for members of the Armed Forces killed on duty was announced by the [[Secretary of State for Defence]] in a  statement in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] on 10 November 2000, to be funded by public subscription.

An international competition was held for the design of the Memorial, which was won by Liam O'Connor Architects and Planning Consultants, with Ian Rank-Broadley, Sculptor.  The project design team consisted of Liam O'Connor (architect), Christopher Barrett (project manager), Alan Baxter & Associates (structural & civil engineers), Christina Godiksen, Robert Rhodes, and Daniel Benson. Liam O'Connor also designed the [[Commonwealth Memorial Gates]] on [[Constitution Hill, London|Constitution Hill]] in [[London]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ukniwm.org.uk/server/show/conMemorial.47929/fromUkniwmSearch/1 |title=Commonwealth Memorial Gates |publisher=Imperial war Museum |accessdate=2007-10-12}}</ref> [[Ian Rank-Broadley]] conceived and executed the sculpture of the Memorial. He earlier sculpted the [[effigy]] of Queen Elizabeth II which has appeared on coins in the UK and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] coins since 1998. The design of the Memorial was officially unveiled at the [[Imperial War Museum]], [[London]] on 6 April 2005.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.forcesmemorial.org.uk/the-memorial-project/the-appeal-launch.asp |title=Armed forces Memorial Appeal Launch |accessdate=2007-10-12}}</ref>

The Memorial was officially dedicated on 12 October 2007 in a ceremony presided by [[Queen Elizabeth II]] and attended by [[Prime Minister]] [[Gordon Brown]] and [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] [[Rowan Williams]]. It was opened to the public on 29 October 2007.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7040801.stm |title=Queen unveils new forces memorial |publisher=BBC |date=2007-10-12 |accessdate=2007-10-12}}</ref> At the unveiling [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles, the Prince of Wales]] said:<blockquote>The magnificence of this new memorial will, at long last, provide a fitting recognition for all those killed on duty since the end of the Second World War. It does not differentiate between those killed in the heat of battle or on a training exercise, by terrorist action or on peace-keeping missions.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article2645019.ece |title=Queen unveils forces memorial |publisher=The Times |date=2007-10-12 |accessdate=2007-10-12 | location=London | first=Helen | last=Nugent}}</ref></blockquote> 

In addition to the Memorial in Staffordshire, a memorial without names will be added to the South Cloister of [[Westminster Abbey]], dedicated to members of the Armed Forces killed in conflict and the members of the [[Royal Fleet Auxiliary]] and the [[Merchant Navy]] who died in conflict zones since the end of the Second World War; and [[roll of honour|rolls of honour]] will be displayed at the [[St Martin-in-the-Fields]] (for the [[Royal Navy]]) and the chapel of the [[Royal Hospital Chelsea]] (for the [[British Army]]), in addition to the existing Rolls of Honour for the [[Royal Air Force]] at [[St Clement Danes]] in [[Strand, London|the Strand]].

The Memorial cost <U+00A3>6 million to build, principally funded by sales of a commemorative [[Battle of Trafalgar|Trafalgar]] coin sold by the [[Royal Mint]], and grants from the [[Millennium Commission]]. The Memorial takes the form of an earth [[tumulus]] (mound), 100 metres in diameter. Inspiration for the Memorial came from "the ancient burial mounds of our ancestors <U+2026> that recollects monuments like [[Silbury Hill]] and the mounds around [[Stonehenge]].<ref name="Armed Forces Memorial Appeal <U+2013> Dedication Ceremony brochure">{{cite book| title=Armed Forces Memorial Appeal <U+2013> Dedication Ceremony brochure|date=2007|page=page 5}}</ref>

The mound is surmounted by a [[Portland stone]] circle, with openings to the east and west and an [[obelisk]] at the eastern end. Within the circle are two straight stone walls, with bronze sculptures at their centres. The names of the 16,000 service personnel are carved into the Memorial's stone walls, with space for an additional 15,000 names to be added. The names of all those [[killed in action|killed in combat]], in training, on [[peacekeeping]] operations and on exercise are included. It includes the dead from operations in [[Palestine]], [[Korea]], [[Malaysia]], the [[Falkland Islands]], [[Iraq]], [[Afghanistan]] and [[Northern Ireland]].

The bronze sculptures are the work of [[Ian Rank-Broadley]]. The Stretcher Bearers sculpture shows a wounded serviceman borne by comrades, watched by grieving family. It represents the cost of armed conflict on those left behind. The Gates sculpture group shows the body of a fallen serviceman taken into the arms of his comrades, and a figure pointing through the Great Gates of Eternity to Paradise. The structure is aligned so that at the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month, the sun's rays will stream through the gap to illuminate the centre of the Memorial.

==Location==
The Memorial is located on a {{convert|150|acre|km2|sing=on}} site at the [[National Memorial Arboretum]], at [[Alrewas]] near [[Lichfield]] in [[Staffordshire]], which opened in 2001, where there are already a number of Service-related memorials. A central location in the UK, outside London, was chosen deliberately to ensure that the memorial was accessible to all communities in the UK.
