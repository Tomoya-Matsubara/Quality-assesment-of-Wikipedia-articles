Front row: Pedwr James, Emile Hamonic, L<U+00E9>na Botrel, [[Th<U+00E9>odore Botrel]], Professor Paul Barbier]]A '''Celtic identity''' emerges in the [[Celtic nations]] of Western Europe in the course of the 19th-century [[Celtic Revival]], taking the form of [[ethnic nationalism]] particularly within the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]], where the [[Irish Home Rule Movement]] results in the secession of an [[Irish Free State]] in 1922. 
After World War II, the focus of the "Celticity" movement shifted to linguistic revival and protectionism, e.g. with the foundation of the [[Celtic League (political organisation)|Celtic League]] in 1961, dedicated to preserving the surviving [[Celtic languages]].

Since the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], the term "Celtic" has been applied to a wide variety of peoples and cultural traits present and past. Today, "Celtic" (sometimes "modern Celts"{{By whom|date=January 2010}}) is often used in order to describe the people, and their respective cultures and languages:
i.e. the [[Bretons]], the [[Cornish people|Cornish]], the [[Irish people|Irish]] (especially the [[Gaeltacht]]), the [[Manx people]], the [[Scottish people|Scots]] ([[G<U+00E0>idhealtachd]]) and the [[Welsh people|Welsh]] (Cymry), i.e. the members of the modern "[[Celtic nations]]".<ref name="Amgueddfa 1">{{cite web|title=Who were the Celts? ... Rhagor|url=http://www.museumwales.ac.uk/en/rhagor/article/1939/|accessdate=2009-12-10|publisher=[[National Museum Cardiff|Amgueddfa Cymru <U+2013> National Museum Wales]]|date=2007-05-04|work=Amgueddfa Cymru <U+2013> National Museum Wales website}}</ref> Except for the Bretons (if discounting Norman & Channel Islander connections), all groups mentioned have been subject to strong [[Anglicisation]] since the [[Early Modern period]], and are hence are also described as participating in an [[Anglo-Celtic]] macro-culture.  By the same token, the Bretons have been subject to strong Francification since the [[Early Modern period]], and can similarly be described as participating in a Franco-Celtic macro-culture.

Less common is the assumption of "Celticity" for European cultures deriving from [[Continental Celtic]] roots ([[Gauls]] and [[Celtiberians]]).  These were either Romanised or Germanised much earlier, before the Early Middle Ages.  Nevertheless, "Celtic" origins are sometimes implied for continental groups such as the [[Asturians]], [[Galician people|Galicians]], [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]], [[French people|French]], [[Swiss people|Swiss]], Alpine Italians, [[Germans]], or [[Austrians]].  The names of  [[Belgium]] and the [[Aquitaine]] hark back to ''[[Gallia Belgica]]'' and ''[[Gallia Aquitania]]'', respectively, in turn named for the [[Belgae]] and the [[Aquitani]].  The Latin name of the [[Swiss Confederacy]], ''Confoederatio Helvetica'', harks back to the [[Helvetii]], the name of [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] to the [[Gallaeci]].

==Celtic revival and Romanticism==
{{See|Celtic Revival}}
'Celt' has been adopted as a label of self-identification by a variety of peoples at different times. 'Celticity' can refer to the inferred links between them.

During the 19th century, French nationalists gave a privileged significance to their descent from the [[Gauls]]. The struggles of [[Vercingetorix]] were portrayed as a forerunner of the 19th-century struggles in defence of French nationalism, including the wars of both Napoleons ([[Napoleon I of France]] and [[Napoleon III of France]]). Basic French history textbooks emphasised the ways in which Gauls could be seen as an example of cultural assimilation; however, the notion that French history textbooks commonly began with the famous words ''"Nos anc<U+00EA>tres les Gaulois..."'' ("Our ancestors the Gauls...") is not supported in fact.<ref>{{Weber, Eugen. "Gauls versus Franks: Conflict and Nationalistm" in ''Nationhood and nationalism in France'',edited by Robert Tombs}}</ref> A similar use of "celticity" for 19th century nationalism was made in [[Switzerland]], when the Swiss were seen to originate in the Celtic tribe of the [[Helvetii]], a link still found in the official Latin name of Switzerland, ''Conf<U+0153>deratio Helvetica'', the source of the nation code CH.  

Before the advance of [[Indo-European studies]], [[philology|philologists]] established that there was a relationship between the [[Goidelic]] and [[Brythonic languages]], as well as a relationship between these languages and the extinct Celtic languages such as [[Gaulish]], spoken in classical times. The terms Goidelic and Brythonic were first used to describe the two [[Celtic languages|Celtic language families]] by [[Edward Lhuyd]] in his 1707 study and, according to the [[National Museum Cardiff|National Museum Wales]], during that century "people who spoke Celtic languages were seen as Celts."<ref name="Amgueddfa 1"/>

At the same time, there was also a tendency to play up alternative heritages in the [[British Isles]] at certain times. For example, in the Isle of Man, in the [[Victorian era]], the "[[Viking]]" heritage was emphasised, and in Scotland, both Norse and [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] heritage was played up.

A [[Romanticism|romantic]] image of the Celt as [[noble savage]] was cultivated by the early [[William Butler Yeats]], [[Lady Gregory]], [[Lady Charlotte Guest]], [[Lady Llanover]], [[James Macpherson]], [[Fran<U+00E7>ois-Ren<U+00E9> de Chateaubriand|Chateaubriand]], [[Th<U+00E9>odore Hersart de la Villemarqu<U+00E9>]] and the many others influenced by them. This image coloured not only the [[England|English]] perception of their neighbours on the so-called "[[Celt belt|Celtic fringe]]" (compare the [[stage Irishman]]), but also [[Irish nationalism]] and its analogues in the other Celtic-speaking countries. Among the enduring products of this resurgence of interest in a romantic, pre-industrial, brooding, mystical Celticity are [[Gorsedd]]au, the revival of the [[Cornish language]], and the revival of the [[Gaelic games]].

During the [[Second World War]] many [[Breton people|Breton]] nationalists collaborated with the Nazis, not least against the [[French resistance]]. After the War some of these collaborators settled in Ireland.<ref>Daniel, A. Le Mouvement Breton, pps 303-6</ref>

==Cold War period (1945-1989)==
[[Irish nationalism|Nationalists]] in [[Northern Ireland]] sought an end to endemic discrimination with the [[Civil Rights Movement]]. Ulster Scots (Scots Irish) have constantly sought to maintain their independence, identity and culture, and the Ulster workers' strike bought down the British-imposed power sharing arrangements in 1974 <ref>Tim Pat Coogan, The Troubles, Arrow Books 1996, pps.200-02</ref>. Breton regionalists participated in the [[May 1968 revolt]] under Breton flags and with the slogan ''Bretagne=Colonie''. 

==Contemporary Celtic identity (1989 to present)==
[[Image:Chwe Chenedl Geltaidd.png|thumb|280px|The six "Celtic nations" within their modern borders are shown in yellow.]]
 
The "modern Celtic" groups' distinctiveness as ''national'', as opposed to regional, minorities has been periodically recognised by major British papers. For example, a ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' editorial in 1990 pointed to these differences, and said that they should be constitutionally recognised:
:"''Smaller minorities also have equally proud visions of themselves as irreducibly Welsh, Irish, Manx or Cornish. These identities are ''distinctly national'' in ways which ''proud people from [[Yorkshire]]'', much less proud people from [[Berkshire]] will never know. Any new constitutional settlement ''which ignores these factors'' will be built on uneven ground.''"<ref>''[[The Guardian]]'', editorial, 8 May 1990</ref>

The [[Republic of Ireland]], on surpassing [[UK|Britain]]'s [[GDP]] per capita in the 1990s for the first time in centuries, was given the moniker "[[Celtic tiger]]". Thanks in part to agitation on the part of Cornish regionalists, [[Cornwall]] was able to obtain [[Objective One]] funding from the [[European Union]]. Scotland and Wales obtained agencies like the [[Welsh Development Agency]], and Scottish and Welsh Nationalists have recently supported the institution of the [[Scottish Parliament]] and [[National Assembly for Wales]]. More broadly, a distinct identity in opposition to that of the metropolitan capitals has been forged and taken strong root. 

These latter evolutions have proceeded hand in hand with the growth of a [[pan-Celticism|pan-Celtic]] or inter-Celtic dimension, seen in many organisations and festivals operating across various Celtic countries. Celtic studies departments at many universities in Europe and beyond, have studied the various ancient and modern Celtic languages and associated history and folklore under one roof.

The [[roots revival]], applied to [[Celtic music]], has brought much inter-Celtic cross-fertilisation, as, for instance, Welsh musicians have revived the use of the mediaeval Welsh [[bagpipe]] under the influence of the Breton ''binio<U+00F9>'', Irish ''uillean'' pipes and famous Scottish pipes, or the Scots have revived the ''bodhran'' from Irish influence. Sports such as [[Hurling]], [[Gaelic Football]] and [[Shinty]] are seen as being 'Celtic', whilst the Scottish [[mod (Scotland)|mod]] and Irish [[fleadh]] are seen as an equivalent to the Breton [[fest noz]].

The [[United States|USA]] has also taken part in discussions of modern Celticity. For example, recently elected [[Virginia]] [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[James H. Webb]], in his 2004 book ''Born Fighting &ndash; How the Scots-Irish Shaped America'', controversially asserts that the early "pioneering" immigrants to [[North America]] were of [[Scotch-Irish American|Scots-Irish]] origins. He goes on to argue that their distinct "Celtic traits" (loyalty to kin, mistrust of governmental authority, and military readiness), in contrast to the "[[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]]" settlers, helped construct the modern "American identity".  [[Irish American]]s also played an important role in the shaping of 19th-century [[Irish republicanism]] through the [[Fenian]] movement, the development of a discourse of the [[Irish Potato Famine (1845-1849)|Great Hunger]] as a British atrocity, and so on.

==Celtic nations==
[[Image:Celtic Nations.svg|right|thumb|175px|The '''Six Nations''']]
{{Main|Celtic nations}}
Six [[nation]]s tend to be most associated with a modern Celtic identity, and are considered 'the Celtic nations'. These are:

:* {{flag|Brittany}}
:* {{noflag}} [[Ireland]] (includes {{flag|Ireland}} and {{noflag}} [[Northern Ireland]])
:* {{flag|Scotland}}
:* {{flag|Wales}}
:* {{flag|Cornwall}}
:* {{flag|Isle of Man}}

It is these 'Six Nations' that (alone) are considered Celtic by the [[Celtic League (political organisation)|Celtic League]] and the [[Celtic Congress]] amongst others. These organisations ascribe to a definition of Celticity based mainly upon language. In the aforementioned six regions, Celtic languages have survived and continue to be used to varying degrees in Ireland, Scotland, Wales, Isle of Man, and Brittany.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.breizh.net/icdbl/saozg/Celtic_Languages.pdf |title=Visio-Map of Europe Celtic Europe.vsd<!-- Bot generated title --> |date= |format=PDF |accessdate=2008-10-31}}</ref>

A number of activists on behalf of other regions/nations have also sought recognition as modern Celts, reflecting the wide diffusion of ancient Celts across Europe. Of these, the following regions are most prominent:

:*{{flag|Galicia}} (including Northern Portugal, once part of ancient Galicia or Gallaecia)
:*{{flag|Asturias}} (in the centre north of Spain) 

In neither Galicia / Northern Portugal nor Asturias has a Celtic language survived, and as such both fall outside of the [[Litmus test (politics)|litmus test]] used by the [[Celtic League (political organisation)|Celtic League]], and the [[Celtic Congress]]. Nevertheless, many organisations organised around Celticity consider that [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] / Northern Portugal ([[Douro]], [[Minho Province|Minho]] and [[Tras-os-Montes]]) and [[Asturias]]  "can claim a Celtic cultural or historic heritage".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.celticleague.org/celtic_nations.html |title=Celtic League American Branch - Celtic Nations |publisher=Celticleague.org |date= |accessdate=2008-10-31}}</ref> These claims to Celticity are rooted in the long historical existence of Celts in these regions and ethnic connections to other Atlantic Celtic peoples<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uwm.edu/Dept/celtic/ekeltoi/volumes/vol6/6_5/alvarez_sanchis_6_5.pdf |title=Microsoft Word - alvarez_sanchis_6_5.doc |date= |format=PDF |accessdate=2008-10-31}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uwm.edu/Dept/celtic/ekeltoi/volumes/vol6/6_15/garcia_alonso_6_15.pdf |title=PaleoHispania<!-- Bot generated title --> |date= |format=PDF |accessdate=2008-10-31}}</ref> (see [[Celtiberians]], [[Celtici]] and [[Castro culture]]). 

Elements of Celtic music, dance, and folklore can be found within [[England]] (eg. [[Yan Tan Tethera]]), and the [[Cumbric language]] survived until the collapse of the [[Kingdom of Strathclyde]] in about 1018.<ref>Fischer, S. R., ''History of Language'', Reaktion Books, 2004, p. 118</ref> England as a whole comprises many distinct regions, and some of these regions, such as [[Cumbria]],<ref>[http://www.celticcumbria.co.uk Page Title<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> [[Lancashire]], Western [[Yorkshire]] and [[Devon]] {{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}, claim more Celtic heritage than others. Notably, although modern Cumbria has similar borders to the older kingdom of [[Rheged]], it is an amalgation of [[Cumberland]], [[Westmorland]], [[Lancashire]] and part of the [[West Riding of Yorkshire]], and many Cumbrians still identify first with these older counties{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}.<ref>http://www.barrowbc.gov.uk/pdf/Cumbria_Unitary_Bid_Critique_V3-web.pdf</ref>

==Migration from Celtic countries==
No treatment of modern Celticity would be complete without mentioning the migrations of people from Celtic countries. A very large portion of the populations of the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] is composed of people from Ireland, Britain, Brittany and the Isle of Man; and [[Jamaica]], [[South Africa]], [[Barbados]], [[Montserrat]], [[Saint-Barth<U+00E9>lemy]], [[Venezuela]], [[Argentina]], [[Brazil]], [[Mexico]], and [[Chile]] have also experienced large-scale migration from these lands at various times.

There are three areas outside Europe with communities of traditional Celtic language speakers: the province of [[Chubut Province|Chubut]] in [[Patagonia]] with Welsh-speaking [[Argentina|Argentinians]] (known as ''[[Welsh settlement in Argentina|Y Wladfa]]''), [[Cape Breton Island]] in [[Nova Scotia]] with [[Canadian Gaelic|Scottish Gaelic]]-speaking [[Canada|Canadians]], and southeast [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] with [[Irish language|Irish]]-speaking [[Canada|Canadians]].

While no Celtic-identified immigrant group is currently pursuing [[independence]] or other [[nationalist]] goals, Celtic-identified people have played critical roles in each societies' movements for independence from the larger [[empire]]s to which they were formerly attached <U+2013> for example, the most common mother-tongue amongst the [[Fathers of Confederation]] which saw the formation of [[Canada]] was [[Goidelic languages|Gaelic]].<ref>[http://www.pch.gc.ca/special/flag-drapeau/defi-challenge/reponses-answers_e.cfm Ministry of Canadian Heritage]. Gaelic most common mother-tongue among Fathers of Confederation. URL accessed 26/04/2006.</ref> Today, Celticity throughout the world is generally presented as a [[cultural]] identity (as opposed to [[nationalist]], but with a [[Race (classification of human beings)|racial]] or [[ethnic]] base), and is experiencing a major revival. There is a movement in [[Cape Breton Island|Cape Breton]] for a separate province in Canada, as espoused by the [[Cape Breton Labour Party]] and others.

Since the 1960s, there has been a very considerable growth of interest and enthusiasm in their Celtic heritage on the part of such people. Certain areas outside of the identified Celtic nations have particularly strong associations with these various identities: the [[Yorke Peninsula]], [[South Australia]], with Cornish Australians; [[Liverpool]] and [[Manchester]] with the Welsh and Irish people in England; [[Jesus College, Oxford]] with Welsh students; [[South Boston|South]] [[Boston]] or the [[South Side Irish|South Side]] of [[Chicago]] with Irish Americans; and certain [[arrondissement]]s of [[Paris]] with Breton Parisians.

Simultaneously, in some former British colonies, or particular regions within them, the term [[Anglo-Celtic]] has emerged as a descriptor of an ethnic grouping. In particular, [[Anglo-Celtic Australian]] is a term commonly used in academic circles in Australia; it refers to at least 80% of the population.<ref>[http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/7d12b0f6763c78caca257061001cc588/af5129cb50e07099ca2570eb0082e462!OpenDocument Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2003, "Population characteristics: Ancestry of Australia's population"] (from '''Australian Social Trends, 2003'''). Retrieved 1 September 2006.</ref> "Anglo-Celtic" can be interpreted as either an affirmation of both Celtic and Anglo-Saxon cultures, or a rejection of the notion that they are separate and distinct. It is not necessarily accepted by all of the people to which it is applied.

==Criticism of modern Celticism==
Many criticisms of modern Celticism tend to centre around the idea that the Modern Celts have little connection with the Ancient Celts and therefore are not entitled to use the name.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} Furthermore, some historians also dispute the suitability of the term "Celtic" in the historic context.<ref name=James>{{cite web|url=http://www.le.ac.uk/ar/stj/alternative.htm|title=Simon James's Ancient Celts Page - An alternative history of 'Celticness'|accessdate=24 December 2009}}</ref>

[[John Collis]] of the [[University of Sheffield]] has argued that the idea of a 'Celtic' culture in the [[British Isles]] was invented entirely by early modern authors, primarily by [[Edward Lhuyd]], and then re-born by modern day nationalists. [[Simon James (archaeologist)|Simon James]] of the University of Leicester says that the Iron Age peoples of Britain should be considered not as generic Celts, but as a mosaic of different societies, each with their own traditions and histories.<ref name=James/> In Ireland, it has been argued that only around a quarter of the island contains significant archaeological evidence of the Iron Age culture typically identified as 'Celtic'.<ref>[http://www.irish-association.org/archives/richard_warner11_99.html CELTIC IRELAND AND OTHER FABLES: POLITICS AND PREHISTORY]</ref>  However, this line of reasoning has itself come under criticism, being labelled an intellectual extension of modern British cultural colonialism, as well as for simplifying the anthropological correlation between material culture and ethnicity. Ruth and Vincent Megaw attacked 'Celt-sceptics' for being motivated by [[English nationalism]] or anxieties about the decline of [[British Empire|British imperial power]]. Simon James wrote a response arguing that the rejection of a Celtic past was not 'nationalist' but partly due to new archaeological evidence, and partly motivated by a [[post-colonial]] and [[multiculturalist]] recognition that Britain has always been home to multiple identities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.le.ac.uk/ar/stj/furthread.htm|title=Simon James's Ancient Celts Page - Further info|accessdate=24 December 2009}}</ref>

Among [[Insular Celtic languages|Insular Celtic]] groups,  while there is strong evidence for linkages between Insular and [[Continental Celtic languages|Continental Celts]], earlier assumptions that the Atlantic Celts must be the descendants of an "invasion" of Continental Celts have largely been proven false. This finding has led some, including Richard Warner of the [[Ulster Museum]], to assert that the Atlantic Celts are "not Celts at all".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irish-association.org/archives/richard_warner11_99.html |title=The Irish Association - Richard Warner |publisher=Irish-association.org |date= |accessdate=2008-10-31}}</ref>  Warner associates Celticity with a "[[gene pool]]" when he claims that "the Celts" were "warrior-adventurers whose influence and effect far outweighed their numbers, but who are most unlikely to have a significant or measurable effect on the Irish gene pool".

Despite this, many universities still maintain "Departments of Celtic Studies", including the [[University of Cambridge]] in England, which has a "Department of
Anglo-Saxon, Norse and '''Celtic'''".<ref>http://www.asnc.cam.ac.uk/</ref> [[Harvard University]] uses the title "Department of Celtic ''languages and literatures''", as a slight differentiation.<ref>http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~celtic/</ref> Three Scottish universities (The University of Glasgow<ref>http://www.gla.ac.uk/celtic/</ref>, The University of Edinburgh and the University of Aberdeen) have celtic departments through which students can study Scots Gaidhlig.
