'''Akira Kurosawa''' (<U+9ED2><U+6FA4> <U+660E> ''Kurosawa Akira'', also <U+9ED2><U+6CA2> <U+660E> in [[Shinjitai]], [[23 March]], [[1910]] &ndash; [[6 September]], [[1998]]) was a prominent [[Japan]]ese [[film director]], [[film producer]], and [[screenwriter]].

Few filmmakers have had a career so long or so acclaimed as Akira Kurosawa, perhaps Japan's best-known filmmaker. His films greatly influenced an entire generation of filmmakers the world over, ranging from [[George Lucas]] to [[Sergio Leone]]. 

His first credited film (''[[Sanshiro Sugata|Sugata Sanshiro]]'') was released in 1943; his last (''[[Madadayo]]'') in 1993. His many awards include the [[Legion d'Honneur]] and an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] for Lifetime Achievement. 

==Early career==
Kurosawa was born in [[Ota, Tokyo|Omori, Ota-ku]], [[Tokyo]], the youngest of seven children. He trained as a painter and began work in the film industry as an assistant director to Kajiro Yamamoto in 1936. He made his directorial debut in 1943 with ''[[Sanshiro Sugata|Sugata Sanshiro]]''. His first few films were made under the watchful eye of the wartime Japanese government and sometimes contained nationalistic themes. For instance, ''[[The Most Beautiful]]'' is a propaganda film about Japanese women working in an armaments factory. ''[[Sanshiro Sugata Part II|Judo Saga 2]]'' has been held to be explicitly anti-American in the way that it portrays Japanese [[judo]] as superior to western (American) [[boxing]]. 

His first post-war film ''No regrets for our youth'', by contrast, is critical of the old Japanese regime and is about the wife of a left-wing dissident arrested for his political leanings. Kurosawa made several more films dealing with contemporary Japan, most notably ''[[Drunken Angel]]'' and ''[[Stray Dog]]''. However it was a period film ''[[Rashomon (film)|Rashomon]]'' which made him internationally famous and won the [[Golden Lion]] at the [[Venice Film Festival]].

== Directorial approach ==

Kurosawa had a distinctive cinematic technique, which he had developed by the 1950s, and which gave his films a unique look. He liked using telephoto lenses for the way they flattened the frame and also because he believed that placing cameras farther away from his actors produced better performances. He also liked using multiple cameras, which allowed him to shoot an action from different angles. Another Kurosawa trademark was the use of weather elements to heighten mood: for example the heavy rain in the final battle in ''Seven Samurai'' and the fog in ''Throne of Blood''. Kurosawa also liked using left-to-right frame wipes as a transition device.

He was known as "Tenno", literally "Emperor", for his dictatorial directing style. He was a perfectionist who spent enormous amounts of time and effort to achieve the desired visual effects. In ''[[Rashomon (film)|Rashomon]]'', he dyed the rain water black with calligraphy ink in order to achieve the effect of heavy rain, and ended up using up the entire local water supply of the location area in creating the rainstorm. In ''[[Throne of Blood]]'', in the final scene in which Mifune is shot by arrows, Kurosawa used real arrows shot by expert archers from a short range, landing within centimetres of Mifune's body. 

Other stories include demanding a stream be made to run in the opposite direction in order to get a better visual effect, and having the roof of a house removed, later to be replaced, because he felt the roof's presence to be unattractive in a short sequence filmed from a train.

His perfectionism also showed in his approach to costumes: he felt that giving an actor a brand new costume made the character look less than authentic. To resolve this, he often gave his cast their costumes weeks before shooting was to begin and required them to wear them on a daily basis and <U+201C>bond with them.<U+201D> In some cases, such as with Seven Samurai, where most of the cast portrayed poor farmers, the actors were told to make sure the costumes were worn down and tattered. 

Kurosawa did not believe that <U+201C>finished<U+201D> music went well with film. When choosing a musical piece to accompany his scenes, he usually had it stripped down to one element (e.g., trumpets only). Only towards the end of his films do we hear more finished pieces.

== Influences ==
A notable feature of Kurosawa's films is the breadth of his artistic influences. Some of his plots are adaptations of [[William Shakespeare]]'s works: ''[[Ran (film)|Ran]]'' is based on ''[[King Lear]]'' and ''Throne of Blood'' is based on ''[[Macbeth]]'', while ''[[The Bad Sleep Well]]'' parallels ''[[Hamlet]]'', but is not affirmed to be based on it. Kurosawa also directed film adaptations of Russian literary works, including ''[[The Idiot (novel)|The Idiot]]'' by [[Dostoevsky]] and ''[[The Lower Depths]]'', a play by [[Maxim Gorky]]. ''Ikiru'' was based on [[Leo Tolstoy]]'s ''[[The Death of Ivan Ilyich]]''. ''[[High and Low]]'' was based on ''[[King's Ransom]]'' by [[United States|American]] [[crime]] writer [[Ed McBain]], [[Yojimbo]] was based on [[Dashiell Hammett]]'s [[Red Harvest]] and also borrows from American [[Western (genre)|Westerns]], and ''[[Stray Dog]]'' was inspired by the detective novels of [[Georges Simenon]]. The American film director [[John Ford]] also had a large influence on his work. 

Despite criticism by some Japanese critics that Kurosawa was "too Western", he was deeply influenced by Japanese culture as well, including the [[Kabuki]] and [[Noh]] theaters and the jidaigeki (period drama) genre of Japanese cinema.

== His influence ==
Kurosawa's films had a huge influence on world cinema. Most notably, ''[[Seven Samurai]]'' was remade as the [[western movie|western]] ''[[The Magnificent Seven]]'', [[science fiction]] movie ''[[Battle Beyond the Stars]]'', and Pixar's ''[[A Bug's Life]]''. It also inspired two [[Hindi films]], [[Ramesh Sippy]]'s ''[[Sholay]]'' and Rajkumar Santhoshi's ''[[China Gate (1998 film)|China Gate]]'', with similar plots. The story has also inspired [[novel]]s, among them [[Stephen King]]'s fifth ''[[The Dark Tower (series)|Dark Tower]]'' novel, ''[[Wolves of Calla]]''. 

The [[Tamil language|Tamil]] film titled ''Virumandi'' directed by [[Kamal Hassan]] also uses Kurosawa's method of storytelling similar to that in ''Rashomon''.  ''Rashomon'' was also remade by [[Martin Ritt]] in 1964 as ''The Outrage''.

''[[Yojimbo (film)|Yojimbo]]''  was the basis for the [[Sergio Leone]] western ''[[A Fistful of Dollars]]'', the [[Coen Brothers]] film ''[[Miller's Crossing]]'', and the [[Bruce Willis]] prohibition-era ''[[Last Man Standing (film)|Last Man Standing]]''. 

''[[The Hidden Fortress]]'' had an influence on [[George Lucas]]'s ''[[Star Wars]]'' films, in particular Episodes I and IV, most notably in the characters of R2-D2 and C3PO.

''[[Rashomon (film)|Rashomon]]'' not only helped open Japanese cinema to the world but virtually entered the English language as a term for fractured, inconsistent narratives as well as influencing other works, including episodes of television series and many motion pictures.

== Collaboration ==
During his most productive period, from the late 40s to the mid-60s, Kurosawa often worked with the same group of collaborators. [[Fumio Hayasaka]] composed music for seven of his films; notably ''Rashomon'', ''Ikiru'' and ''Seven Samurai''. Many of Kurosawa's scripts, including ''Throne of Blood'', ''Seven Samurai'' and ''Ran'' were co-written with [[Hideo Oguni]]. [[Yoshiro Muraki]] was Kurosawa's [[production designer]] or [[art director]] for most of his films after ''Stray Dog'' in 1949 and [[Asakazu Naki]] was his [[cinematographer]] on 11 films including ''Ikiru'', ''Seven Samurai'' and ''Ran''. Kurosawa also liked working with the same group of actors, especially [[Takashi Shimura]], [[Tatsuya Nakadai]] and [[Toshiro Mifune]]. His collaboration with the latter, which began with 1948's ''[[Drunken Angel]]'' and ended with 1965's ''[[Red Beard]]'', is one of the most famous director-actor combinations in cinema history.

== Later films ==

''[[Red Beard]]'' marked a turning point in Kurosawa's career in more ways than one. In addition to being his last film with Mifune, it was his last in black-and-white. It was also his last as a major director within the Japanese studio system making roughly a film a year.  Kurosawa was signed to direct a Hollywood project, ''[[Tora! Tora! Tora!]]''; but [[20th Century Fox]] replaced him with [[Kinji Fukasaku]] before it was completed.  His next few films were a lot harder to finance and were made at intervals of five years. The first, ''[[Dodesukaden]]'', about a group of poor people living around a rubbish dump, was not a success. 

After an attempted suicide, Kurosawa went on to make several more films although arranging domestic financing was highly difficult despite his international reputation. ''[[Dersu Uzala]]'', made in the [[Soviet Union]] and set in Siberia in the early 20th century, was the only Kurosawa film made outside Japan and not in Japanese. It is about the friendship of a Russian explorer and a nomadic hunter. It won the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Oscar]] for Best Foreign Language Film. ''[[Kagemusha]]'', financed with the help of the director's most famous admirers, [[George Lucas]] and [[Francis Ford Coppola]], is the story of a man who is the body double of a medieval Japanese lord and takes over his identity after the lord's death. ''[[Ran (film)|Ran]]'' was the director's version of King Lear, set in medieval Japan. It was by far the greatest project of Kurosawa's late career, and he spent a decade planning it and trying to obtain funding, which he was finally able to do with the help of the French producer [[Serge Silberman]]. The film was a phenomenal international success and is generally considered Kurosawa's last masterpiece.

Kurosawa made three more films during the 1990s which were more personal than his earlier works. ''[[Dreams (1990 film)|Dreams]]'' is a series of vignettes based on his own dreams. ''[[Rhapsody in August]]'' is about memories of the [[Nagasaki]] atom bomb and his final film: ''[[Madadayo]]'' is about a retired teacher and his former students. Kurosawa died in [[Setagaya, Tokyo]], at age 88.

==Trivia==
Kurosawa was a notoriously lavish gourmet, and spent huge quantities of money on film sets providing an uneatably large quantity and quality  of delicacies, especially meat, for the cast and crew.
