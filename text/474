The '''Confederate Memorial Gateway''' in [[Hickman, Kentucky]] is a historic [[cemetery]] gateway in [[Fulton County, Kentucky]].  It was funded in 1913 by the Private Robert Tyler Chapter of the [[United Daughters of the Confederacy]].<ref name="HickmanKy">[http://www.trailsrus.com/monuments/reg1/hickman.html Hickman, Ky.] Trailsrus.com</ref>

The Memorial Gateway was designed by Sir Moses Ezekiel, and built by the NcNeal Marble Company of [[Marietta, Georgia]].  It took ten years and $10,000 to construct the [[granite]] structure.<ref name="HickmanKy" />  The back is solid granite, but the front has ornamentation.  The names of seventy Confederate soldiers are carved upon the hoods of the structure.  It has a center opening for vehicles, and two side openings for pedestrian traffic.  The inscription on its capstone reads: "1861 Our Heroes 1865".  Due to its size and how long after the war it was built, it was meant more to celebrate the [[Confederate States of America]] instead of mourning it, even through it was built in a cemetery.<ref>Brent, Joseph.  ''Confederate Memorial Gateway in Hickman NRHP Nomination Form'' (Kentucky Heritage Council, 1997)</ref>

Due to its presence on the [[Mississippi River]], Hickman was placed at a strategic point, and was held by both sides during the war.  It was strongly pro-Confederate during the war, but after the Confederate lost control of the county in 1862, it would see occasional raids by Confederate cavalry.<ref name="HickmanKy" /><ref>Kleber, John E.  ''The Kentucky Encyclopedia''. (University Press of Kentucky, 1992). pg.360</ref>

On July 17, 1997, it was one of sixty-one different monuments to the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] in Kentucky placed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]], as part of the [[List of Civil War Monuments of Kentucky|Civil War Monuments of Kentucky]] [[Multiple Property Submission]].  The only other monument on the list that is a gateway is the [[Confederate Memorial Gates in Mayfield]].  One other monument on the list is in Fulton County: the [[Confederate Memorial in Fulton]], located twenty miles to the east in [[Fulton, Kentucky]].<ref name="mps">{{Cite journal|title={{PDFlink|[http://pdfhost.focus.nps.gov/docs/NRHP/Text/64500229.pdf National Register of Historic Places Multiple Property Submission: Civil War Monuments in Kentucky, 1865-1935]|1.81&nbsp;[[Mebibyte|MiB]]<!-- application/pdf, 1908267 bytes -->}}|date=January 8, 1997 |author=Joseph E.
