The '''Scottish National Party''' (SNP) ({{lang-gd|P<U+00E0>rtaidh N<U+00E0>iseanta na h-Alba}}; {{lang-sco|Scottis Naitional Pairtie}}) is a [[centre-left]] [[List of Scottish political parties|political party]] which campaigns for [[Scottish independence]].<ref>[http://www.snp.org/independence Independence{{ndash}} SNP - Scottish National Party<!--Bot-generated title-->]</ref> In the last few decades, the SNP has normally polled the second highest number of votes for a [[Scottish political parties|political party]] in Scotland. However, the 2009 European Election saw the party top the poll with almost 100,000 votes more than the [[Scottish Labour Party]]. As a result of the [[Scottish Parliament election, 2007|2007 elections]], it is the largest party in the [[Scottish Parliament]],<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/6627589.stm BBC NEWS | UK | Scotland | SNP begins coalition discussions<!--Bot-generated title-->]</ref> and is running a [[Minority government|minority administration]] in the [[Scottish Government]]. The SNP is to propose the [[Scottish referendum bill 2010]] to the Parliament in order to bring about its flagship policy of independence via a referendum in November 2010.

The SNP holds 47 of 129 seats in the [[Scottish Parliament]] but failed to gain the support of Scottish Labour, the [[Liberal Democrats]] or the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] as a result of its pro-[[Scottish Independence]] policy, preventing them from forming a [[majority government]].  The party also hold 2 of 6 Scottish seats in the [[European Parliament]], 7 of 59 Scottish seats in the [[UK Parliament]], and 364 of 1,224 [[:Category:Councillors in Scotland|Councillors]] in [[Scottish local government|local government]], helping form 12 out of 32 local administrations.

==History==
{{Main|History of the Scottish National Party}}

The SNP was formed in 1934 from the merger of the [[National Party of Scotland]] and the [[Scottish Party]]. Professor Douglas Young, who was the leader of the Scottish National Party from 1942 to 1945 fought for the Scottish people to refuse conscription and his activities were popularly vilified as undermining the British war effort against the Nazis. Young was imprisoned for refusing to be conscripted. The SNP first won a [[UK Parliament|parliamentary]] seat at the [[Motherwell (UK Parliament constituency)|Motherwell by-election]] in 1945, but Dr [[Robert McIntyre]] MP lost the seat at the [[UK general election 1945|general election]] three months later. They next won a seat in 1967, when [[Winnie Ewing]] was the surprise winner of a [[Hamilton by-election, 1967|by-election]] in the previously safe [[British Labour Party|Labour]] seat of [[Hamilton (UK Parliament constituency)|Hamilton]]. This brought the SNP to national prominence, leading to the establishment of the [[Royal Commission on the Constitution (United Kingdom)|Kilbrandon Commission]]. The high point in UK General Elections thus far was when the SNP polled almost a third of all votes in Scotland at the [[United Kingdom general election, October 1974|October 1974 general election]] and returned 11 MPs to [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Westminster]], to date the most MPs it has had. The SNP is unusual{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} in that the brand of nationalism it reflects is left wing and not right wing.  Scholars of nationalism, like Eric Hobsbawm, cite Scottish nationalism as being unique in its character by not conforming to the general characteristics that tend to define the phenomenon.<ref>Eric Hobsbawm, Nations and nationalism since 1780</ref>

==Party organisation==
The SNP consists of local branches of party members.  Those branches then form an association in the constituency they represent (unless there is only one branch in the constituency, in which case it forms a constituency branch rather than a constituency association).  There are also eight regional associations, to which the branches and constituency associations can send delegates.

The SNP's policy structure is developed at its annual national conference and its regular national council meetings.  There are also regular meetings of its national assembly, at which detailed discussion (but not finalising) of party policy takes place.

The party has an active [[Young Scots for Independence|youth wing]] as well as a [[Federation of Student Nationalists|student wing]].  There is also an [[SNP Trade Union Group]].  There is an independently-owned monthly newspaper, ''[[The Scots Independent]]'', which is highly supportive of the party.

The SNP's leadership is vested in its National Executive Committee (NEC) which is made up of the party's elected office bearers and 10 elected members (voted for at conference).  The SNP parliamentarians (Scottish, Westminster and European) and councillors have representation on the NEC, as do the Trade Union Group, the youth wing and the student wing.

According to accounts filed with the [[Electoral Commission (UK)|Electoral Commission]] for the year ending 2008, the party had a membership of 15,097 in 2008, up from 9,450 in 2003.<ref>[http://news.scotsman.com/latestnews/SNP39s-membership-surges-by-6037.4836805.jp SNP's membership surges by 60%], ''[[The Scotsman]]'', 1 January 2009</ref> In 2004 the party had income of approximately <U+00A3>1,300,000 (including [[bequest]]s of just under <U+00A3>300,000) and expenditure of about <U+00A3>1,000,000.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

==Policy platform==
The SNP's policy base is, by and large, in the mainstream European [[Social democracy|social democratic]] mould.  For example, among its policies are a commitment to [[unilateral nuclear disarmament]], [[Progressive taxation|progressive personal taxation]] and the eradication of [[poverty]], [[Education in Scotland|free state education]] including support grants for [[higher education]] students and a pay increase for nurses.  It is also committed to an [[independent Scotland]] being a full [[Member states of the European Union|member state]] of the [[European Union]], to the country joining the [[Euro|single European currency]] at the appropriate [[exchange rate]] and is against membership of [[NATO]] (however this remains controversial).

Contrary to the expectations of many outside the party, the SNP is not expressly [[republicanism|republican]], and its general view is that this is an issue secondary to that of Scottish independence.  Many SNP members are republicans, however, and both the party student and youth wings are expressly so.

The SNP is committed to an independent Scotland within the [[Commonwealth of Nations]].

In August 2009 as part of its third legislative term in the Scottish Parliament, the Government proposes to debate the [[Scottish referendum bill 2010]], which would set out a planned referendum for November 2010 on the issue of Scottish independence. It was not however expected to pass, due to opposition from all the major opposition parties in the Parliament.<ref name=ReferendumBill2010>{{cite web

==Party ideology==
Although it is has a representative majority of the moderate left-of-centre politicians, this has not always been the case.  Almost from the party's foundation there have been internal ideological tensions.  This was largely a product of the way in which the left-of-centre [[National Party of Scotland]] amalgamated with the right-of-centre [[Scottish Party]].  Nowadays, ideological tensions within the SNP have been partially resolved.

However, by the 1960s, the party was starting to become defined ideologically.  It had by then established a National Assembly which allowed for discussion of policy and was producing papers on a host of policy issues that could be described as [[social democratic]].  Also, the emergence of [[William Wolfe]] (universally known as Billy) as a leading figure played a huge role in the SNP defining itself as a left-of-centre [[Social democracy|social-democratic]] party.  He recognised the need to do this to challenge the dominant political position of the [[Scottish Labour Party]].

He achieved this in a number of ways: establishing the SNP Trade Union Group; promoting left-of-centre policies; and identifying the SNP with labour campaigns (such as the [[Upper-Clyde Shipbuilders Work-in]] and the attempt of the workers at the Scottish ''[[Daily Express]]'' to run as a [[cooperative]]).  It was during Wolfe's period as SNP leader in the 1970s that the SNP became clearly identified as a social-democratic political party.

There were some ideological tensions in the 1970s SNP.  The party leadership under Wolfe was determined to stay on the left of the [[Politics of Scotland|Scottish political spectrum]] and be in a position to challenge Labour.  However, the party's MPs, mostly representing seats won from the [[Scottish Conservative Party|Conservatives]], were less keen to have the SNP viewed as a left-of-centre alternative to Labour, for fear of losing their seats back to the Conservatives.

There were further ideological and internal struggles after 1979 with the [[79 Group]] attempting to move the SNP further to the left, away from being what could be described a 'social-democratic' party, to an expressly 'socialist' party.  79 Group members including current leader, [[Alex Salmond]], were expelled from the party. This produced a response in the shape of the [[Campaign for Nationalism in Scotland]] from those who wanted the SNP to remain a 'broad church', apart from arguments of left vs. right.

The 1980s saw the SNP further define itself as a party of the left, for example running campaigns against the [[community charge|poll tax]].  It developed this platform to the stage it is at now: a clear, moderate, centre-left political party.  This has itself not gone without internal criticism from the left of the party who believe that in modern years the party has become too moderate.

The ideological tensions inside the SNP are further complicated by the arguments between [[SNP gradualist|gradualists]] and [[SNP fundamentalist|fundamentalists]]. In essence, gradualists seek to advance Scotland to independence through further devolution, in a 'step-by-step' strategy.  They tend to be in the moderate -left grouping, although much of the [[79 Group]] was gradualist in approach.  However, this 79 Group gradualism was as much a reaction against the fundamentalists of the day, many of whom believed the SNP should not take a clear left or right position.

The position of fundamentalists within the SNP is further complicated by the fact that modern fundamentalists are unlike the old-style.  They tend to be on the left of the party, critical of both the gradualist approach to independence and what they perceive as a moderation of the party's socio-economic policy portfolio.

This grouping of "neo-fundamentalists" have their roots within the camp of the former high-profile Labour Party MP [[Jim Sillars]] who left Labour to form the short-lived Scottish Labour Party in the 1970s (it had no connection with the UK Labour Party or the current Scottish Labour group in the Scottish Parliament). Sillars eventually joined the SNP, winning the Govan, Glasgow, by-election in 1988 to become an SNP MP. He lost the Westminster seat at the 1992 general election and expressed his disappointment by calling the Scottish people 'Ninety minute patriots'.

==European Free Alliance==
The SNP retains close links with [[Plaid Cymru]] and [[UK MPs|MPs]] of both parties co-operate closely with each other. They work as a single group within the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]], and were involved in joint campaigning during the [[2005 UK General Election|2005 General Election]] campaign. Both are in the [[European Free Alliance]] (EFA), which works with the [[European Green Party]] to form a grouping in the [[European Parliament]]: the [[Greens - European Free Alliance]].  Although there is no coalition in the Scottish Parliament (the SNP having run a minority government since May 2007) the Scottish Greens supported the appointment of the government under an agreement which also specified areas of common policy and gave the Greens input to the budget process and convenorship of the parliamentary committee on transport, infrastructure and climate change.

==Criticism==
===Accusations of anglophobia===

The SNP have been charged with being "[[Anglophobia|Anglophobic]]". In 2000, the Labour party said that two SNP members of the Scottish Parliament were anti-English after they "registered their support for Germany's (2006 Football World Cup) bid on its official website".<ref name="SNP's German support condemned">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/625090.stm SNP's German support condemned]</ref> The SNP responded that they "have no position on where the World Cup is held" and that it was "silly to describe the website entry as anti-English".<ref name="SNP's German support condemned"/>

In 1999, the comedian [[Billy Connolly]], a staunch Labour Party supporter, was quoted as saying, "the Scottish Parliament is a joke"; he also claimed that "this new racism in Scotland, this anti-Englishness" was "entirely their [the SNP's] fault".<ref name="UK Scots 'anti-English' - survey">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/379935.stm UK Scots 'anti-English' - survey]</ref> The SNP responded that Scots "are enthusiastic about the parliament and will dismiss his absurd remarks about the SNP for the nonsense they are."<ref name="UK Scots 'anti-English' - survey"/> The SNP has fielded English and English-born candidates, such as [[Michael Russell|Mike Russell]].

Prominent figures in Scottish politics such as Labour's [[George Foulkes, Baron Foulkes of Cumnock]] and the Liberal Democrats' [[Jamie Stone]] (and subsequently [[Danny Alexander]]) have publicly apologised for calling the SNP "xenophobic".<ref>[http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=265512007 The Scotsman<!--Bot-generated title-->]</ref> SNP MSP [[Ian McKee]] has by contrast pointed out his own status in the Scottish Parliament chamber as an Englishman<ref>[http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/officialReports/meetingsParliament/or-07/sor1206-02.htm The Scottish Parliament - Official Report<!--Bot-generated title-->]</ref> as evidence of there being no such anti-English feeling. Indeed, McKee is one of six English SNP MSPs, along with other prominent figures such as Mike Russell and Christine Grahame.

===Accusations of 'cash for policies'===

The party has been criticised over a <U+00A3>500,000 donation from the transport businessman [[Brian Souter]]. One month later, in April 2007, the SNP's commitment (made at the party's 2006 conference) to re-regulate the [[Transport in Scotland|bus network]] was not included in their 2007 manifesto, although the SNP denies any direct link.<ref>[http://business.scotsman.com/topics.cfm?tid=539&id=621242007 SNP under attack after bus U-turn]</ref>. Opposition politicians suggested that the donation and policy shift were linked and that it was a case of "cash for policies".<ref>[http://www.sundayherald.com/news/heraldnews/display.var.1346656.0.snp_accused_of_dumping_bus_plan_to_please_millionaire_backer.php SNP accused of dumping bus plan to please millionaire backer]</ref>

[[Brian Souter]] went on to make a further donation of <U+00A3>125,000 to the SNP, making him their single biggest donor<ref>[http://edinburghnews.scotsman.com/latestnews/SNP-faces-hovercraft-dustup.3719954.jp SNP faces hovercraft dust-up]</ref>. Souter made approaches to the SNP government for a <U+00A3>3 million subsidy for his company, [[Stagecoach Group|Stagecoach]], to develop a [[hovercraft]] service between [[Kirkcaldy]] and [[Portobello, Edinburgh|Portobello]] in Scotland<ref>[http://www.sundayherald.com/news/heraldnews/display.var.1807832.0.snp_donor_in_3_3m_hovercraft_subsidy_plea.php  SNP donor in <U+00A3>3.3m hovercraft subsidy plea]</ref>. The service had already received subsidy from the previous Labour administration for the pilot scheme, but was put on hold pending "clarification" of the public sector's involvement<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/edinburgh_and_east/7253201.stm BBC NEWS | Scotland | Edinburgh, East and Fife | Row over Forth hovercraft freeze<!--Bot-generated title-->]</ref>.
