''For the racehorse, see [[Fanfreluche (horse)]]''

'''''Fanfreluche''''' was a [[French-language]] [[Canada|Canadian]] children's television show made in [[Quebec]] by [[T<U+00E9>l<U+00E9>vision de Radio-Canada|Radio-Canada]]. The show made its debut in 1968 and ran for forty-six episodes until 1971. [http://archives.emissions.ca/787-8417-718712.html] It starred Fanfreluche, a living doll (played by [[Kim Yaroshevskaya]]) who retold fairy tales and legends to the viewers. When the story went a way that displeased her, she would physically enter it to "fix" the ending which sometimes put her in a perilous situation.

The character of Fanfreluche (played by the same actress) had its debut in another Radio-Canada children's show called ''La Bo<U+00EE>te <U+00E0> surprise''. From the character in this show, prominent [[Montreal]] businessman and [[Thoroughbred]] horse breeder [[Jean-Louis L<U+00E9>vesque]] named one of his [[filly]]s [[Fanfreluche (horse)|Fanfreluche]]. Believed to have used the name to please a grandchild, Levesque's filly became a Canadian and United States champion racehorse in 1970.
