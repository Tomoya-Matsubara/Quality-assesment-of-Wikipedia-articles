'''Kent''' is a city in the U.S. state of [[Ohio]] and the largest city in [[Portage County, Ohio|Portage County]].  It is located along the [[Cuyahoga River]] in [[Greater Cleveland|Northeastern Ohio]] on the western edge of the county.  The population was 27,906 at the [[United States Census 2000|2000 United States Census]] and 27,983 in the 2008 estimate.  The city is counted as part of the [[Akron metropolitan area|Akron Metropolitan Statistical Area]] and the larger [[Greater Cleveland|Cleveland-Akron-Elyria Combined Statistical Area]].

Part of the [[Connecticut Western Reserve]], Kent was originally settled in 1805 and was known as '''Franklin Mills'''.  Settlers were initially attracted to the area due to its location along the Cuyahoga River as a place for water-powered mills.  Later development came in the 1830s and 1840s as a result of the village's position along the route of the [[Pennsylvania and Ohio Canal]]. Leading up to the [[American Civil War]], Franklin Mills was noted for its activity in the [[Underground Railroad]].  With the decline of the canal and the emergence of the railroad, the village became the home of the [[Atlantic and Great Western Railroad]] maintenance shops through the influence of [[Marvin Kent]].  In 1864 the village was renamed Kent in honor of and in gratitude for Marvin Kent's efforts. Today Kent is a [[college town]] best known as the home of the main campus of [[Kent State University]], founded in 1910, and as the site of the 1970 [[Kent State shootings]].

Historically a manufacturing center, education is the city's largest economic sector with Kent State University the city's, and one of the region's, largest employers.  The [[Kent City School District]] and the [[Kent Free Library]] provide additional education opportunities and resources.  Many of Kent's demographic elements are influenced by the presence of the university, particularly the median age, median income, and those living below the poverty level.  The city is governed by a [[council-manager government|council-manager system]] with a [[city manager]], a nine-member city council, and a mayor. Kent has nearly 20 parks and preserves and hosts a number of annual festivals including ones related to [[Earth Day]], folk music, and the U.S. [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]]. In addition to the [[Kent State Golden Flashes|Kent State athletic teams]], the city also hosts a number of amateur and local sporting events at various times during the year.  Kent is part of the Cleveland-Akron media market and is the city of license for three local radio stations and three television stations and includes the regional affiliates for [[National Public Radio]] (NPR) and the [[Public Broadcasting Service]] (PBS).  Although most residents commute to work in private vehicles, alternate transportation includes a [[Portage Area Regional Transportation Authority|public bus service]] and hike-and-bike trails. As the home of the [[Davey Tree Expert Company]], Kent is known as "The Tree City" while residents are referred to as "Kentites".   The city has produced a number of notable individuals, particularly in politics, athletics, and the entertainment industry.

==History==
{{Main|History of Kent, Ohio}}
The region was originally inhabited by various tribes of [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]], including the early [[Mound builder (people)|Mound Builders]]. Around 1780, Captain [[Samuel Brady]] achieved notoriety for his activities in the area, including his famous leap of {{convert|21|ft|m|0}} over the [[Cuyahoga River]] to avoid capture by an unknown band of American Indians.  The site, known as Brady's Leap, is now a city park.<ref>{{cite book |title= History of Portage County Ohio|last= Brown|first= R.C |authorlink= |coauthors= Norris, J.E.|year= 1885, 1972 revision|publisher= Warner, Beers, and Company|location= [[Chicago, Illinois]]|isbn= |pages= 451<U+2013>452}} This book gives 1790 as the date, but several other sources give 1780 as the date</ref>  Settlement by Europeans began in the late 1790s and early 1800s.  As part of the [[Connecticut Western Reserve]], the area was divided into [[survey township]]s in 1798 and almost all of what is now Kent was originally part of Town 3 Range 9, which would eventually be known as [[Franklin Township, Portage County, Ohio|Franklin Township]].<ref>Brown and Norris, p. 431; "The present territory of Franklin, Town 3 Range 9..." See also [[:File:Portage County 1826.jpg]]</ref>  [[Aaron Olmsted]], a wealthy [[Connecticut]] merchant, had purchased the {{convert|16000|acre|ha|adj=on}} township and named it for his son Aaron Franklin Olmsted.<ref>{{cite book |title= 1874<U+2013>1978 Bicentennial Atlas of Portage County, Ohio |editor=Plough, Cyrus T. |year= 1978|publisher= Portage County Historical Society|location= [[Ravenna, Ohio]], [[USA]]|isbn= |page= A-28}} Comes from page 24 of the ''Combination Atlas Map of Portage County'' by L.H. Everts, published in 1874, which is included as part of the 1978 Atlas</ref>

Franklin Township was surveyed in 1803 and settled in November 1805 when John Haymaker and his family moved west from [[Warren, Ohio|Warren]] to the banks of the Cuyahoga River. They were joined by John's brother George and their father Jacob Haymaker and their families early the next year, and built a [[gristmill]] in 1807.<ref>{{cite book |title= History of Kent|last= Grismer|first= Karl H.|year= 1932 |edition= 2001 Revision|publisher= Record Publishing (1932), Kent Historical Society (2001)|location= Kent, Ohio|page= 11}}</ref>  Initial growth in the area was slow, but eventually two small villages would develop due to the potential for power generated by the Cuyahoga River that could be used in gristmills and manufacturing.  The first village, known as Franklin Mills, or locally as the "Lower Village", developed mostly around the original Haymaker property. In 1818, Joshua Woodard arrived in the area and began constructing buildings just north of the village forming the "Upper Village" that would come to be known briefly as Carthage.<ref>Brown and Norris, p. 435 "...the twin settlements were known respectively as "Upper Village" and "Lower Village." The name Carthage was afterward applied to the Upper Village."</ref>

[[File:KentOhioCanal.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Former P & O Canal lock and dam downtown]]
In the 1820s, Franklin Mills was included in the route of the [[Pennsylvania and Ohio Canal]] (P & O Canal).  When construction began on the canal in the mid-1830s, land speculation was rampant in many areas of northeast Ohio along the canal, including Franklin Mills. As a result, an industrial and business region was established along the east side of the river in what is now downtown Kent.  Factories and mills were either planned or constructed along the Cuyahoga River, some of which either were never built or ultimately failed, due mostly to effects of the [[Panic of 1837]].  A lock and attached arch dam, however, was completed in 1836.<ref name=grismer19>Grismer, pp. 19<U+2013>25</ref>  The canal officially opened in 1840, but would only operate into the 1860s. By the 1870s the canal was completely shut down.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ohiohistorycentral.org/entry.php?rec=791 |title=Pennsylvania and Ohio Canal |date=July 1, 2005 |work=OhioHistoryCentral.org |publisher=Ohio Historical Society |accessdate=August 20, 2010}}</ref>

In the era leading up to the [[American Civil War]], Franklin Mills was an active stop on the [[Underground Railroad]], giving fugitive slaves shelter on their escape to [[Canada]].  There were three notable stops in Franklin Mills, one of which still stands as of 2010.<ref>{{Cite news |author= Smith, Diane|url= http://www.recordpub.com/news/article/109958|title= Area's abolitionist roots unveiled |newspaper= [[Record-Courier (Ohio)|Record-Courier]]|publisher= Dix Publishing|date= October 12, 2002 |accessdate= January 22, 2010 |quote=  In Kent, the Joshua Woodard house on Fairchild Avenue is the only building on the Underground Railroad that is still standing.}}</ref>  During this period, from 1835<U+2013>1839, noted American abolitionist [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]] moved to the village, operating a tannery along the Cuyahoga River with Zenas Kent.<ref name=grismer19/>

In 1863 the [[Atlantic and Great Western Railroad]] was constructed through Franklin Mills, due largely to the efforts of local businessman [[Marvin Kent]], son of Zenas Kent.  Marvin Kent had started his own railroad company, the [[Atlantic and Great Western Railroad|Franklin and Warren Railroad]], in 1851 after Franklin Mills, already home to several Kent family ventures and properties, was bypassed by the Cleveland and Pittsburgh Railroad that same year.  Kent was also successful in getting the village named as the location of the railroad's maintenance yards and shops in 1864.  The geographic location along the railroad and being home to the shops reinvented and revitalized the village as an important stop on the east-west line between [[St. Louis]] and [[New York City]].  The shops would open in 1865 and the railroad would play an important part of Kent's industry and development through the early 20th century before the shops were completely shut down in 1930.  To honor Marvin Kent, the village was renamed Kent in 1864, although this change was not official until the village was incorporated on May 6, 1867.<ref>Grismer, pp. 29, 37, 124, 125</ref>

[[John Davey (tree surgeon)|John Davey]] came to Kent in 1881 as head grounds keeper at Standing Rock Cemetery, and planted several trees, landscaped the cemetery, and performed experiments on trees.  In 1901, he published his theories on [[Arboriculture|tree surgery]] with his book ''The Tree Doctor'', and later established the [[Davey Tree Expert Company]] in 1909.  The efforts of Davey and the presence of Davey Tree led to the establishment of "The Tree City" as a nickname for Kent, which is reflected in the city's seal.<ref>Grismer, p. 233</ref><ref>{{cite book| title= Kent Bicentennial Historical Fun Facts |year= 2006 |publisher= Kent Area Chamber of Commerce|page= 5}}</ref>  The company continues to be headquarted in Kent and serves as the city's largest private employer.<ref name=phoenix>{{cite news |title=Downtown Kent, Ohio, rising Phoenix-like as city, KSU and businesses coalesce |author=Nichols, Jim |newspaper=[[The Plain Dealer]] |date=November 26, 2009 |url=http://blog.cleveland.com/metro/2009/11/downtown_kent_ohio_rising_phoe.html |accessdate= April 29, 2010}}</ref>

[[File:Lowry Hall 1.jpg|thumb|250px|Lowry Hall, one of the original campus buildings of Kent State University]]After a fire destroyed the Seneca Chain Company in 1909, one of the city's main industries at the time, city leaders created the Kent Board of Trade in 1910, a forerunner to the Chamber of Commerce.

In early May 1970, protests began on the campus of Kent State University over the United States' [[Cambodian Campaign|invasion of Cambodia]] in the [[Vietnam War]].  These protests and demonstrations, which included rioting in downtown Kent on May 2, culminated in the May 4, 1970 [[Kent State shootings]], where four students were killed and nine were wounded by the [[Ohio Army National Guard]].<ref>Hildebrand, Keller, and Herington, pp. 165<U+2013>166</ref>  Several memorials have been placed at the site over the years and commemorations have been held annually since 1971.

In 2003, the 1836 arch dam was bypassed to meet water quality standards set by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency.  To preserve the historic dam, a small park was built behind the dam and the river was rerouted through the old canal lock.  During warm-weather months, water is pumped over the dam.  The park, known as Heritage Park, was formally dedicated in May 2005.<ref name=restoration>{{Cite web |url= http://www.kentohio.org/reports/dam.asp|title= Cuyahoga River Restoration Project |accessdate=January 10, 2009|work= City of Kent, Ohio website|publisher= City of Kent, Ohio}}</ref>

===Climate===
[[File:Kent seasons.png|thumb|left|250px|The four main seasons in Kent: from top left clockwise, winter, spring, summer, and fall]]
Kent's climate is classified as a [[humid continental climate]] in the ''Dfa'' [[K<U+00F6>ppen climate classification]] meaning it typically has very warm, humid summers and cold, snowy winters with moderate and variable spring and autumn seasons.  The record high temperature is {{convert|103|F|C|0}}, set on July 7, 1988, with the record low of {{convert|-22|F|C|0}} recorded January 17, 1982.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.weather.com/outlook/driving/interstate/wxclimatology/daily/USOH0460?climoMonth=7|title=

Kent is not considered part of the Lake Erie [[snowbelt]], though [[lake-effect snow]] does occur at times.  The city is in what is referred to as the "secondary snowbelt", meaning it will receive heavier snowfall totals from lake-effect snow when certain wind directions are more prevalent, but typically sees far less snowfall than areas to the north closer to [[Lake Erie]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://starkcountyweather.com/content/news/2009/12/twitter-follower-where-is-the-northeast-ohio-snowbelt-exactly/ |title= Twitter Follower: Where IS the Northeast Ohio Snowbelt Exactly? |author= Camper, Maria |date= December 11, 2009 |work= StarkCountyWeather.com |publisher= Stark County Weather Center |accessdate=April 17, 2010}}</ref>  While temperatures below the [[Melting point|freezing point]] are typical in the winter months, [[Thaw (weather)|thaw]] periods where temperatures exceed {{convert|50|F|C|0}} and even {{convert|60|F|C|0}} are not uncommon in January and February.<ref name=January/>

==Economy==
[[File:Davey Tree headquarters 2.jpg|left|250px|thumb|Corporate headquarters of the Davey Tree Expert Company, Kent's largest private employer]]
Kent's location along the Cuyahoga River and later the Pennsylvania and Ohio Canal and multiple railroad lines made it attractive initially for the establishment of small [[gristmills]] for the production of flour and various factories.  Progressively larger factories later developed due to increased power available from the river and eventually due to the ease and lower cost of transportation of goods to other markets.<ref name=grismer1125/> During the latter half of the 19th century and into the early 20th century, the city's largest employers were all industrially based, including the [[Atlantic and Great Western Railroad]] and its successors, which operated its main maintenance shops in the village; the Seneca Chain Company; and bus manufacturer [[Twin Coach]] among others.<ref>Grismer, pp. 168<U+2013>185</ref>  A disastrous fire at the Seneca Chain Company in 1909 led to the creation of the Kent Board of Trade<U+2014>an early Chamber of Commerce<U+2014>which was successful in getting Kent selected in 1910 as the site of what would become Kent State University.<ref>Hildebrand, pp. 2<U+2013>10</ref>

Changes in the structure of the railroad and declines in the manufacturing sector during the mid-20th century combined with the rapid growth of Kent State University following World War II led to the university becoming the city's largest employer and influenced the development of other areas of the city's economy.  Beginning in the late 2000s, the university, along with the city and private investors, began to play a more active role in the redevelopment of downtown Kent and has aided in the development of local high tech companies.<ref name=phoenix/><ref>{{cite news |title=KSU research earns national rank |author=Staul, Jenna |newspaper=KentWired.com |date=March 10, 2010 |url=http://kentwired.com/ksu-research-earns-national-rank/ |accessdate=April 29, 2010}}</ref>  Kent State operates Centennial Research Park, along [[Ohio State Route 59]] in Kent's [[Joint Economic Development District]] with Franklin Township, which houses two [[high tech]] start-up companies in the [[liquid crystal]] industry.<ref>{{cite news |title=Kent shares taxes from AlphaMicron |author=Fredmonsky, Matt |newspaper=[[Record-Courier (Ohio)|Record-Courier]] |date=November 27, 2008 |url=http://www.recordpub.com/news/article/4475010 |quote=...the university's Centennial Research Park, which falls inside the Kent Franklin Joint Economic Development District. |accessdate= April 30, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kent.edu/research/facilities/CentennialResearchPark.cfm |title=Centennial Research Park |year=2010 |work=Kent.edu |publisher=Kent State University |accessdate=April 29, 2010}}</ref> Kent has an additional Joint Economic Development District with [[Brimfield Township, Portage County, Ohio|Brimfield Township]] south of the city limits.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.brimfieldohio.com/kentbrimfieldjedd.htm |title=Kent/Brimfield JEDD |date=March 3, 2009 |work=BrimfieldOhio.com |publisher=Brimfield Township |accessdate=April 29, 2010}}</ref>  Through the Kent Regional Business Alliance, the city also supports two [[business incubator]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.krba.biz/incubator/index.php |title=KRBA Small Business Incubator |year=2009 |work=KRBA.biz |publisher=Kent Regional Business Alliance |accessdate=April 29, 2010}}</ref>
