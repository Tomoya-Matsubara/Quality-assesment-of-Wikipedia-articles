'''''Aqualung''''' is the fourth studio album by the [[rock music|rock]] band [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]], released in [[1971 in music|1971]].  It was their first album with [[John Evan]] as a full-time member, their first with new bassist [[Jeffrey Hammond]] and last album featuring [[Clive Bunker]] on drums.
The first side of the [[LP album|LP]] contains a series of six character sketches, including two sketches of people of questionable repute (title character Aqualung and Cross-Eyed Mary) and two autobiographical tracks including "Cheap Day Return", written by band leader [[Ian Anderson (musician)|Ian Anderson]] while returning from a visit to his critically ill father.  The overall message of the lyrics on the second side is said to be "pro-God but anti-church", and makes the statement that organized religion can actually restrict a person's relationship with his God instead of enhancing it. Anderson was not intending to make Aqualung a [[concept album]].

==Production==
The album was one of the first to be recorded at the newly opened studios of [[Island Records]] in Basing Street, [[London]]. [[Led Zeppelin]] were mixing their [[Led Zeppelin IV|untitled fourth album]] ([[Led Zeppelin IV]]) at the same time. In an interview on the 25th anniversary edition of the album, Anderson said that trying to record in their studio was very difficult. There were two recording studios at the location; Led Zeppelin worked in the smaller studio while Tull got the larger,<ref name=theirtime>"Their Time is Gonna Come", ''[[Classic Rock Magazine]]: Classic Rock Presents Led Zeppelin'', 2008, p. 24.</ref> which was probably the original chapel based on Anderson's description of its "orchestral" feeling.

Many of the songs are primarily [[Acoustic music|acoustic]]. "Cheap Day Return", "Wond'ring Aloud" and "Slipstream" are short, completely acoustic "bridges", and "[[Mother Goose (song)|Mother Goose]]" is also mostly acoustic.

In an interview on ''[[Aqualung Live]]'' (2005) (track 16) Ian Anderson claimed that:
<blockquote>I always said at the time that this is not a concept album; this is just an album of varied songs of varied instrumentation and intensity in which three or four are the kind of keynote pieces for the album but it doesn't make it a concept album.  In my mind when it came to writing the next album, ''[[Thick as a Brick]]'', was done very much in the sense of: 'Whuh, if they thought ''Aqualung'' was a concept album, O-O-K, we'll show you a concept album.' And it was done as a kind of spoof, a send-up, of the concept album genre. ... But, ''Aqualung'' itself, in my mind was never a concept album. Just a, just a bunch of songs.</blockquote>

==Cover==
The album's original cover art by [[Burton Silverman]] features a portrait of the title character, Aqualung, which many have considered to be inspired by Ian Anderson, though Anderson denies it.  The rear cover shows a less-lecherous looking portrait of the same character sitting on a street-curb with a dog, a scene reminiscent of the band's photographic portrait with age make-up and a pack of dogs on their first album, ''[[This Was]]''.  The inner art on the fold-out cover showed portraits of the five band members in typical stage attire performing irreverent acts in a chapel<U+2014>perhaps simultaneously depicting the theme of the second side of the LP while commemorating the band's recording-studio environment.

==Release==
''Aqualung'' peaked at #7 on the [[Billboard Music Charts]]' [[North America]]n pop albums chart and number 4 on the UK Album Chart.<ref>[http://www.chartstats.com/artistinfo.php?id=2064 UK Chart]</ref> The single "Hymn 43" hit #91 on ''Billboard's'' pop singles chart. In 2003, the album was ranked number 337 on ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine's list of [[The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|the 500 greatest albums of all time]]. The orchestrals were also arranged by [[Dee Palmer]] (named David Palmer at the time).

''Aqualung'' was one of only two Jethro Tull albums which were released in [[quadraphonic sound]], the other being ''[[War Child (album)|War Child]]''. This version featured several differences from the stereo release. "Wind Up" (included in the CD reissue of album) is in a higher key (three semitones), and "Aqualung" begins with two solo repetitions of the opening riff instead of one.
