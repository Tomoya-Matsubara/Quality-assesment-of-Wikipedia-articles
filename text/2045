{{Distinguish|Sandown Castle, Kent}}
'''Sandown Castle'''  was built as one of Henry VIII's [[Device Forts]] at [[Sandown]] on the [[Isle of Wight]] from 1544 onwards, near Sandown [[Isle of Wight]].  Although it was never attacked, Culver whilst being built it was the scene of a desperate battle with French invaders who had landed at [[Whitecliff Bay]] and made their way over [[Culver Down]] amid heavy skirmishing in 1545. The French were repulsed.

It was eroded away, and finally demolished before the present-day town of Sandown was established.  Its site is now the Sandham Grounds public park, between Fort Street and Culver Parade, and it is said that its remains are still visible at low tide. 

For its successors, see [[Sandown]].
