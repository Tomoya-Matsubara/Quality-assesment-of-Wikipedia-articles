'''Hurricane Gloria''' was a powerful [[Cape Verde-type hurricane|Cape Verde-type]] [[hurricane]] that formed during the [[1985 Atlantic hurricane season]] and prowled the [[Atlantic Ocean]] from [[September 16]] to [[September 28]]. Gloria reached Category 4 on the [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale]] near the [[Bahamas]], but weakened significantly by the time it made landfall on [[North Carolina]]'s [[Outer Banks]]. From there, Gloria closely followed the [[Mid-Atlantic states|Mid-Atlantic]] coastline and made a second landfall on [[Long Island]], [[New York]], and, after crossing the [[Long Island Sound]], it made a third landfall in [[Connecticut]].

Overall, the storm caused extensive damage along the [[East Coast of the United States]], amounting to $900 million ($1.6 billion in 2005 [[US dollars|USD]]), and was responsible for 8 fatalities. The storm was the first significant system to impact the [[northeastern United States]] since [[Hurricane Agnes]] in [[1972 Atlantic hurricane season|1972]] and the last until [[Hurricane Bob]] in [[1991 Atlantic hurricane season|1991]].

==Storm history==
{{storm path|Gloria 1985 track.png}}
Gloria began as a tropical wave that moved off the coast of Africa on [[September 15]]. It moved westward through the favorable tropical Atlantic Ocean, and organized into a tropical depression the next day while south of the [[Cape Verde Islands]]. Tracking steadily west-northwestward due to the strong subtropical ridge, the depression continued to strengthen and became Tropical Storm Gloria on the 17th. Conditions for tropical development deteriorated, causing Gloria to weaken to a tropical depression on the 18th. After it crossed 45<U+00B0>W on the 20th, the system was able to restrengthen to a tropical storm, and steadily intensified as it approached the [[Lesser Antilles]]. While 620&nbsp;miles (1000&nbsp;km) east-southeast of [[Saint Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands|St. Croix]], Gloria attained hurricane status.<ref name="mwr">{{cite web |author = Case, Robert A. | title = Annual Summary: Atlantic Hurricane season of 1985 | publisher = Monthly Weather Review | url = http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/general/lib/lib1/nhclib/1985.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate=2006-03-30}}</ref>

Moving westward, Gloria threatened much of the [[Leeward Islands]], promping the islands' respective governments to issue [[Tropical cyclone warnings and watches|Hurricane Warnings]] in anticipation of the storm. A turn to the west-northwest occurred on [[September 22]], and the hurricane passed 155&nbsp;miles (250&nbsp;km) to the north of [[Anegada]], the northernmost island in the [[Lesser Antilles]]. A break in the subtropical ridge, caused by Tropical Storms [[1985 Atlantic hurricane season#Tropical Storm Fabian|Fabian]] and [[1985 Atlantic hurricane season#Tropical Storm Henri|Henri]], was responsible for the northward turn and caused Gloria to take a northwest track. While passing to the northeast of the [[Bahamas]], Gloria strengthened significantly in very favorable conditions, reaching major hurricane status on the 24th and peak wind speeds of 145&nbsp;mph (235&nbsp;km/h) and a central pressure of 919&nbsp;[[mbar]] on the 25th.<ref name="nhc">{{cite web |author = Lawrence, Miles B. | title = Preliminary Report: Hurricane Gloria | publisher = NOAA | url = ftp://ftp.nhc.noaa.gov/pub/storm_archives/atlantic/prelimat/atl1985/gloria/ | format = GIF | accessdate=2006-03-30}}</ref> This is the second lowest pressure ever recorded in an [[Atlantic hurricane]] that never reached [[Category 5]] status, only second to [[Hurricane Opal]] of the [[1995 Atlantic hurricane season|1995 season]].

Shortly after peaking, Gloria's assymetrical wind field caused the storm to rapidly weaken, and its winds decreased to 90&nbsp;mph (145&nbsp;km/h) after 18 hours.<ref name="assymetry">{{cite journal | author =  Bender, Morris A. | title = The Effect of Relative Flow on the Asymmetric Structure in the Interior of Hurricanes | year = 1996 | month = October | journal = Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences | volume = 54 | issue = 6 | pages = 703-724 | url = http://ams.allenpress.com/amsonline/?request=get-document&doi=10.1175%2F1520-0469(1997)054%3C0703:TEORFO%3E2.0.CO%3B2 }}</ref> Continuing around the periphery of the subtropical ridge, the hurricane turned to the north-northeast, and its winds strengthened to 105&nbsp;mph (170&nbsp;km/h) as it passed over the warm waters of the [[Gulf Stream]]. Gloria then struck [[Cape Hatteras, North Carolina]] early on [[September 26]], with winds of 105&nbsp;mph (170&nbsp;km/h) and a pressure of 942&nbsp;[[mbar]] while accelerating to the northeast. Gloria became the strongest recorded hurricane to strike the [[U.S. East Coast]] so far north, a distinction it still holds. It paralleled the coastlines of [[Virginia]], [[Maryland]], [[Delaware]], and [[New Jersey]], coming within miles of land. 

Gloria made its final landfall on western [[Long Island]] as a minimal hurricane just 10&nbsp;hours after hitting the Outer Banks.<ref name="nhc"/> Originally, the National Hurricane Center classified Gloria as a major hurricane upon making landfall, but it was later downgraded in the seasonal post-analysis.<ref name="nyc">{{cite web | author = Mandia, Scott A. | title = What's In Store For New York's Future? | publisher = Suffolk County Community College | work = The Great Hurricane of 1938: The Long Island Express | accessdate=2006-03-30 | url = http://www2.sunysuffolk.edu/mandias/38hurricane/hurricane_future.html}}</ref> Shortly thereafter the storm crossed the [[Connecticut]] coastline near [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]], and while continuing northeastward through [[New England]], it became extratropical over [[Maine]] early on the 28th.

==Impact==
[[Image:H52 hurricane gloria 1985.jpg|right|thumb|Flooding from Hurricane Gloria]]
Hurricane Gloria was a large hurricane that affected much of the [[northeastern United States]]. Gloria brought strong wind gusts to the area, downing thousands of trees and leaving over 2 million people without power. Overall, Gloria caused $900&nbsp;million (1985 [[USD]]) in property damage and 8 deaths, a total lower than expected due to the hurricane's arrival at low tide.

===Carolinas and Mid-Atlantic===
Upon making landfall on the [[Outer Banks]], Gloria was a fast-moving hurricane that struck at low tide, reducing [[storm surge]]s to a maximum of 6&nbsp;ft (1.8&nbsp;m) in [[North Carolina]]. Other locations from [[South Carolina]] through [[New Jersey]] reported surges less than 1&ndash;5&nbsp;feet (0.3&ndash;1.5&nbsp;m) high. Similarly, winds were relatively minimal and confined to the coast. [[Diamond Shoal Light]] reported sustained winds of 100&nbsp;mph (160&nbsp;km/h), and [[Cape Hatteras]], where the storm's eye came ashore, experienced 75&nbsp;mph (120&nbsp;km/h) winds. Much of the [[Mid-Atlantic]] coastline was largely unscathed from Gloria's winds, excluding a report of 90&nbsp;mph (145&nbsp;km/h) on the [[Chesapeake Bay Bridge-Tunnel]] and a report of 80&nbsp;mph (130&nbsp;km/h) in [[Ocean City, New Jersey]]. Though Gloria moved quickly through the region, it dropped moderate rainfall in locations, including peaks of 7.09&nbsp;inches (180&nbsp;mm) in [[New Bern, North Carolina]] and 6.04&nbsp;inches (153&nbsp;mm) at [[Baltimore-Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport|Baltimore-Washington International Airport]].<ref name="nhc">[ftp://ftp.nhc.noaa.gov/pub/storm_archives/atlantic/prelimat/atl1985/gloria/ NHC Gloria Report]</ref><ref name="mwr">[http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/general/lib/lib1/nhclib/1985.pdf 1985 Monthly Weather Review]</ref> In addition, some unofficial reports in southeastern [[Virginia]] indicated amounts of up to 8&nbsp;inches (200&nbsp;mm) of rain.<ref name="vahistory">{{cite web | author = Hydrometeorological Prediction Center | title = Late Twentieth Century Virginia Hurricane History | url = http://www.hpc.ncep.noaa.gov/research/roth/valate20hur.htm | publisher = NOAA | accessdate = 2006-03-30}}</ref>

Because much of the Mid-Atlantic experienced the western, weaker side of the hurricane, damage was relatively light. High winds downed numerous trees throughout the area, leaving hundreds of thousands without power, including 237,000 in New Jersey, 124,000 in Maryland, and 56,000 in Virginia.<ref name="geo">{{cite web| url=http://www.geocities.com/hurricanene/hurricanegloria.htm| title=Hurricane Gloria - September 27, 1985| work=United States Hurricanes| first=Michael| last=Grammatico| publisher=Geocities| accessdate=2006-03-29}}</ref> Extreme rainfall in [[Virginia]] resulted in $5.5&nbsp;million (1985 USD, $9.8 million 2005 USD) in damage.<ref name="vahistory">[http://www.hpc.ncep.noaa.gov/research/roth/valate20hur.htm Late Twentieth Century Virginia Hurricane History]</ref> Intense flood waters split [[Long Beach Island]] in half for a period of time.<ref name="hville">{{cite web| url=http://www.hurricaneville.com/gloria.html| first=Greg| last=Machos| year=2005| publisher=hurricaneville.com| title=Hurricane Gloria: 20 years later| accessdate=2006-03-29}}</ref> The hurricane's winds caused significant beach erosion, the area most affected being the Outer Banks.<ref name="mwr"/>

===Long Island and New York===
[[Image:Sunday Newsday Sept. 29 1985 Gloria Cover.jpg|right|thumb|Newspaper cover of Gloria showing an uproofed house]]
Though Gloria hit [[Long Island]] with winds of 85&nbsp;mph (135&nbsp;km/h), its fast forward speed of 35&nbsp;mph (55&nbsp;km/h) resulted in winds of 115&nbsp;mph (185&nbsp;km/h) in eastern [[Long Island]].<ref name="geo">[http://www.geocities.com/hurricanene/hurricanegloria.htm HURRICANE GLORIA - September 27, 1985]</ref> [[Islip, New York]] recorded a wind gust of 85&nbsp;mph (135&nbsp;km/h), though few other wind reports were available from the island.  Because the hurricane arrived at low tide, storm surges were generally low, peaking at 6.9&nbsp;feet (2.1&nbsp;m) at [[Battery Park (New York)|Battery Park]]. Because it moved quickly, Gloria failed to produce significant rainfall amounts, and caused only 3.4&nbsp;inches (86&nbsp;mm) of rain in [[Central Park|Central Park]].<ref name="mwr">[http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/general/lib/lib1/nhclib/1985.pdf 1985 Monthly Weather Review]</ref> 

Gloria's high winds caused moderate damage across Long Island and southeastern New York. The area hit the worst was eastern Long Island, where high wind gusts blowing thousands of trees into buildings and across roads. In addition, the winds ripped roofs off of many buildings, including hangars at the [[MacArthur Airport]] and the roof of the [[Islip]] Police Station.<ref name="geo">[http://www.geocities.com/hurricanene/hurricanegloria.htm HURRICANE GLORIA - September 27, 1985]</ref> Prolonged exposure to high winds and waves led to moderate beach erosion, washing away several piers and docks.<ref name="geo">[http://www.geocities.com/hurricanene/hurricanegloria.htm HURRICANE GLORIA - September 27, 1985]</ref> The storm surge, though relatively weak, destroyed 48&nbsp;houses on the ocean side of the island. Gloria's high winds left 683,000&nbsp;people in New York without power, with some lacking electricity for over eleven days. Even though damage amounted to $300&nbsp;million ($532&nbsp;million in 2005&nbsp;USD),<ref name="nyafter">{{cite news| first=Steve| last=Wick| url=http://www.newsday.com/community/guide/lihistory/ny-history-hs9glor,0,1814853.story| title=Life in the Wake of Gloria: An epic hurricane transforms LI, its people and, eventually, its power company| publisher=Newsday| date=2006| accessdate=2006-03-29}}</ref> due to well-executed evacuations there was only one casualty, the death occurring from a falling tree.<ref name="geo">[http://www.geocities.com/hurricanene/hurricanegloria.htm HURRICANE GLORIA - September 27, 1985]</ref>

===New England===
[[Image:Gloria rainfall.gif|left|thumb|rainfall totals from Gloria]]
Upon making landfall in [[Milford, Connecticut]], Gloria was a weakened hurricane that passed quickly through the area. Though still a large hurricane, Gloria hit at low tide, resulting in low to moderate storm surges of 5&nbsp;feet (1.5&nbsp;m) in [[Groton, Connecticut]], 6&nbsp;feet (1.8&nbsp;m) in [[New Bedford, Massachusetts]], and 1&nbsp;foot (.3&nbsp;m) in [[Portland, Maine]]. The hurricane produced gusty winds across [[New England]], with a peak observation of 83&nbsp;mph (135&nbsp;km/h) in [[Waterbury, Connecticut]] and [[Blue Hill, Connecticut]]. Gloria dropped moderate precipitation in the area amounting to a maximum of 6&nbsp;inches (150&nbsp;mm) in [[Littleville Lake, Massachusetts]]. In addition, Gloria caused significant beach erosion in Connecticut and [[Rhode Island]].<ref name="mwr">[http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/general/lib/lib1/nhclib/1985.pdf 1985 Monthly Weather Review]</ref>

Gloria's high winds downed numerous trees across New England, causing minor to moderate damage. In the region, Connecticut received the worst of the hurricane, where tree and structual damage was greatest. Along the coastline, storm surge and strong waves washed away several fishing piers, and some roadways were underwater during the storm's passage. The hurricane did not pass close enough to [[Rhode Island]] and parts of [[Massachusetts]], so these areas did not receive experience significant damage.<ref name="geo">[http://www.geocities.com/hurricanene/hurricanegloria.htm HURRICANE GLORIA - September 27, 1985]</ref> [[New Hampshire]] was affected only slightly from the hurricane, and was limited to minor wind damage and localized flooding.<ref name="newh">{{cite web| url=http://www.nhoem.state.nh.us/Mitigation/SecIII.shtm| author=Division of Emergency Services, Communications, and Management/Bureau of Emergency Management| publisher=New Hampshire Department of Safety| title=Geologic Hazards| work=Natural Hazards Mitigation Plan| year=2000| accessdate=2006-03-29}}</ref> In [[Maine]], damage was more severe, where strong wind gusts ripped off roofs and uprooted hundreds of trees.

==Aftermath==
{{seealso|List of retired Atlantic hurricanes}}
In the immediate aftermath in New York, hundreds of thousands had great difficulty living their everyday lives without power. The long duration without electricity led to a general dislike against the [[Long Island Lighting Company]]. This increased further when the company left the $40 million (1985 USD) repair bill to the ratepayers, citing the company didn't have hurricane insurance. Citizens quickly protested this privately owned company, and within years the publicly owned Long Island Power Authority was formed.<ref name="nyafter"/>

In Maine, most citizens remained indoors during the passage of the hurricane. One police officer noted that even the criminals stayed home. In the [[Lewiston, Maine|Lewiston]] area, restaurants experienced a great surge in business. During the power outage after the storm, several businesses stored frozen goods for houses without a generator.<ref name="maine"/>

On [[December 30]], [[1985]], President [[Ronald Reagan]] declared several counties in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, New York, Rhode Island, Connecticut, and Massachusetts as federal disaster areas. This declaration allowed those counties to apply for disaster assistance.<ref name="disaster">{{cite web| url=http://www.taxlinks.com/rulings/1985/revrul85-195.htm| publisher=[[Internal Revenue Service]]| year=[[1985-12-30]]| title=IRS Revenue Ruling 85-195| accessdate=2006-03-29}}</ref>

Due to its impact, the name Gloria was retired from the Atlantic tropical storm name list in the spring of 1986, so it will never again be used for an [[Atlantic hurricane]].  It was replaced with Grace in the [[1991 Atlantic hurricane season|1991 season]].
