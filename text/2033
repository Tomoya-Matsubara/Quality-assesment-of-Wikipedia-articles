== Early life ==
Andrews was born on May 14, 1947 in [[Jersey City, New Jersey]].  When Andrews turned seventeen, she literally bumped into television legend [[Arthur Godfrey]] on a busy Manhattan street.  She shared her bad day with the radio icon and a quick friendship blossomed.  He arranged for Andrews a meeting with [[Ford Models]].  It turned out to be his last day in Manhattan and he wanted to leave the city by doing a good deed.

Andrews was on the other side of the camera for years, working as a Ford model for some of the greatest photographers of the '60s and '70s.  They included [[Richard Avedon]], [[Dick Ballerian]], [[Irving Penn]], [[Hiro (photographer)|Hiro]], [[Bert Stern]], [[Gordon Munro]], and [[Milton Greene]], who recognized that Andrews had a burning desire to click the shutter.

== Rock photographer ==
Encouraged by former [[Beatle]] [[Ringo Starr]], Andrews began shooting fashion assignments for designer boutiques along [[Rodeo Drive]] and trendy [[Melrose Avenue]].  She branched quickly into the music business, snapping photos of many rock performers as well as shooting publicity and photo packages for two of [[Ringo Starr]] albums <U+2013> ''[[Ringo the 4th]]'' and ''[[Bad Boy (Ringo Starr album)|Bad Boy]]''.

== Nashville ==
Andrews moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]] in 1994 and opened her photography studio in Cummins Station the following year.  In 1996 she was appointed director of photography for [[Twang]], a [[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] take on country music.

In addition to CD packages and promotional photography for major labels, her work has appeared in and on the covers of ''[[McCall's]]'', ''[[USA Today]]'', ''JAZZIZ'', ''[[Penthouse (magazine)|Penthouse]]'', ''[[Black Enterprise]]'', ''[[Music Row]]'', ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'', and several other music publications. She also shoots for many advertising agencies.

== Personal ==
Andrews is married to Edwin Barnes (1990). She was previously engaged to [[Ringo Starr]], whom she sued for [[palimony]]. She has two younger sisters and two dogs.
