As the prophesied Destroyer of Time, he is the only one able to destroy the Millennium Earl. Allen has appeared in several other pieces of ''D.Gray-man'' media, including the two novels and the two video games.

== Character outline ==

=== Background ===

Allen was born with a deformed left arm, actually caused by the effects of an Innocence, and abandoned by his parents. He later worked at a circus and met [[List of D.Gray-man characters#Mana Walker|Mana Walker]], a clown. Mana adopted Allen the day his contract with the circus expired, December 25.<ref name="AllenBioVol1">{{cite book|last=Hoshino|first=Katsura|title=D.Gray-man 1|publisher=Viz Media|date=2006-05-02|pages=62|isbn=978-1-4215-0623-4}}</ref><ref name="Ch166">{{cite book|last=Hoshino|first=Katsura|title=D.Gray-man 17|date=2008-12-04|chapter=The 166th Night|isbn=978-4-08-874605-0|language=Japanese}}</ref> When Mana died, Allen attempted to resurrect him through the [[List of D.Gray-man characters#Millennium Earl|Millennium Earl]]'s offer, instead turning Mana into an akuma. The resurrected Mana was ordered to kill Allen, slicing him through the left eye. Allen's deformed left arm awakened as an anti-akuma weapon, destroying Mana, and his left eye became cursed, allowing him to see the souls of akuma. As a result of this experience, Allen's hair became white. Shortly after, [[Exorcist]] General [[List of D.Gray-man characters#Cross Marian|Cross Marian]] offered to take Allen as a disciple and train him as an Exorcist.<ref name="Ch3">{{cite book|last=Hoshino|first=Katsura|title=D.Gray-man 1|publisher=Viz Media|date=2006-05-02|chapter=The 3rd Night|isbn=978-1-4215-0623-4}}</ref> Allen trained under Cross until the General decided to send him to the Black Order headquarters in Great Britain.<ref name="Ch2">{{cite book|last=Hoshino|first=Katsura|title=D.Gray-man 1|publisher=Viz Media|date=2006-05-02|chapter=The 2nd Night|isbn=978-1-4215-0623-4}}</ref> At an unknown time, [[List of D.Gray-man characters#The 14th|the 14th]], a traitor member of the Noah Family and Mana's younger brother, implanted his memories into Allen.<ref name="Ch167">{{cite book|last=Hoshino|first=Katsura|title=D.Gray-man 17|date=2008-12-04|chapter=The 167th Night|isbn=978-4-08-874605-0|language=Japanese}}</ref>

=== Personality ===
Allen is a friendly and kind-hearted person. Because he can see the souls of the akuma, he decided to live and fight for their souls. Eventually, he realizes that human souls also need salvation and learns the importance of his friends and comrades. He then devotes himself equally to both causes.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hoshino|first=Katsura|title=D.Gray-man 9|publisher=Viz Media|date=2006-05-06|chapter=The 83rd Night|isbn=978-1-4215-1610-3}}</ref> Because he wishes to save humanity, he is at odds with fellow Exorcist [[List of D.Gray-man characters#Yu Kanda|Yu Kanda]], who tells him that Exorcists are not saviors.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hoshino|first=Katsura|title=D.Gray-man 2|publisher=Viz Media|date=2006-08-01|chapter=The 16th Night|isbn=978-1-4215-0624-1}}</ref> Allen is loyal to his friends and comrades and protects them at any cost.<ref name="Ch53">{{cite book|last=Hoshino|first=Katsura|title=D.Gray-man 6|publisher=Viz Media|date=2007-08--07|chapter=The 53rd Night|isbn=978-1-4215-1054-5}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Hoshino|first=Katsura|title=D.Gray-man 12|publisher=Viz Media|date=2009-02-03|chapter=The 111st Night|isbn=978-1-4215-2389-7}}</ref>
