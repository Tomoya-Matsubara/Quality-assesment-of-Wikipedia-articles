The '''''Magdeburg'' class''' of [[light cruiser]]s was a group of four ships built for the [[German Empire|German]] [[Kaiserliche Marine|Imperial Navy]] before World War I. The ships were all laid down in 1910, and completed by the end of 1912. One ship of the class, [[SMS Breslau|''Breslau'']], is famous for escaping through the Mediterranean at the start of the First World War, before being transferred to Turkish service.

==Design==
===Dimensions and machinery===
The ships of the class were 130 m at the waterline, and 130.5 m overall. The ships had a beam of 14 m, a draught of 5.48 m, and displaced 4,362 [[tonne]]s normally, and 4,915 tonnes at a full load.<ref name="World War I Naval Combat">{{cite web|title=World War I Naval Combat|url=http://www.worldwar1.co.uk/cruisers/sms-magdeberg.html|accessdate=19 February 2008}}</ref>
The ships had different power plants; ''Magdeburg'' and ''Stralsund'' had 3 shaft Bergmann turbines, which delivered 25,000 [[Horsepower#Shaft_horsepower|shp]] and a top speed of {{convert|27|kn|km/h}}. ''Breslau'' had 4 shaft AEG-Vulcan turbines, which also produced {{convert|25000|shp|abbr=on}} and a top speed of {{convert|27|kn|km/h}}, while ''Strassburg'' had 2 shaft Navy turbines, which also delivered the same horsepower and speed.

===Armament===
The ships of the class were all originally armed with twelve 105mm (4.1&nbsp;in) guns in single mounts, along with two 500mm (19.7&nbsp;in) torpedo tubes, and 120 mines. In 1915, ''Stralsund'' was rearmed with seven 150mm (5.9&nbsp;in) guns and two 88mm (3.4&nbsp;in) anti-aircraft guns, with ''Strassburg'' receiving the same rearmament in 1916. ''Breslau'', by that time in Ottoman service as the ''Midilli'', was re-equipped with two 150&nbsp;mm guns in 1916, and by 1917, had a full armament of eight 150&nbsp;mm guns.

==Service history==
The lead ship of the class, [[SMS Magdeburg|''Magdeburg'']], led a short service life. The ship ran aground near the Odensholm lighthouse in the [[Baltic Sea]] on 26 August 1914. Efforts to refloat the ship failed; the Russian cruisers ''Bogatyr'' and [[Russian cruiser Pallada (1911)|''Pallada'']] arrived and destroyed the ship with gunfire.

[[SMS Breslau|''Breslau'']] was assigned to the Mediterranean Division at the start of World War I. On 4 August, the ship bombarded [[Bona]], three days later, the ship indecisively engaged the British light cruiser HMS ''Gloucester''. On 16 August, the ship was sold to the [[Ottoman Empire]], but retained her German crew. The ship operated in the [[Black Sea]], participating in several raids and battles with the Russian fleet. On 20 January 1918, ''Breslau'' attempted to raid British naval forces near the [[Dardanelles]]; she sank two British [[Monitor (ship)|monitors]], but was sunk after she struck 5 [[Naval mine|mines]].

[[SMS Stra<U+00DF>burg|''Stra<U+00DF>burg'']] was assigned to the II Scouting Group at the start of World War I. On 28 August 1914, she took part in the [[Battle of Heligoland Bight]], and was moderately damaged. After the end of the war, the ship was ceded to Italy, and sunk by air attack during World War II.

[[SMS Stralsund|''Stralsund'']] was also assigned to the II Scouting Group, alongside her sistership ''Strassburg''. She participated in the [[Battle of Dogger Bank (1915)|Battle of Dogger Bank]] on 24 January 1915, as part of the support for Admiral [[Franz von Hipper|Hipper's]] [[battlecruiser]]s in the I Scouting Group. After the war, ''Stralsund'' was ceded to France as war reparations, and sold for scrap in 1933.
