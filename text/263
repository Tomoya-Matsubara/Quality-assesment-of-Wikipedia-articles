'''''Ioann Zlatoust''''' ({{lang-ru|<U+0418><U+043E><U+0430><U+043D><U+043D> <U+0417><U+043B><U+0430><U+0442><U+043E><U+0443><U+0441><U+0442>}}) was an {{sclass|Evstafi|battleship|4}} [[pre-dreadnought battleship]] of the [[Imperial Russian Navy]]'s [[Black Sea Fleet]]. She was built before [[World War I]] and her completion was greatly delayed by changes made to reflect the lessons of the [[Russo-Japanese War]] of 1905. She was the second ship of her [[ship class|class]].

She and her [[sister ship]] {{ship|Russian battleship|Evstafi||2}} were the most modern ships in the Black Sea Fleet when World War I began and formed the core of the fleet for the first year of the war, before the {{sclass|Imperatritsa Mariya|battleship|4}} [[dreadnought]]s entered service. ''Ioann Zlatoust'' and ''Evstafi'' forced the German [[battlecruiser]] {{SMS|Goeben}} to disengage during the [[Battle of Cape Sarych]] shortly after Russia declared war on the Ottoman Empire in late 1914. She covered several bombardments of the [[Bosphorus]] fortifications in early 1915, including one where she was attacked by the ''Goeben'', but ''Ioann Zlatoust'', together with the other Russian pre-dreadnoughts, managed to drive her off. ''Ioann Zlatoust'' was relegated to secondary roles after the first dreadnought entered service in late 1915 and reduced to reserve in 1918 in [[Sevastopol]].

''Ioann Zlatoust'' was captured when the Germans took the city in May 1918 and was turned over to the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] after the [[Armistice with Germany|Armistice]] in November 1918. Her engines were destroyed in 1919 by the British when they withdrew from Sevastopol to prevent the advancing [[Bolsheviks]] from using the ship against the [[White movement|White Russians]]. She was abandoned when the Whites evacuated the [[Crimea]] in 1920 and was [[scrap]]ped by the Soviets in 1922<U+2013>23.

==Description==
''Ioann Zlatoust'' was {{convert|379|ft|1}} [[length at the waterline|long at the waterline]] and {{convert|385|ft|9|in|1}} long [[length overall|overall]]. She had a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|74|ft|1}} and a maximum [[Draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|28|ft|1|abbr=on}}. Her displacement was {{convert|12855|LT|t|lk=on}} as completed.<ref>McLaughlin 2003, p. 147</ref>

She had two 3-cylinder [[Marine steam engine#Triple or multiple expansion|vertical triple expansion steam engines]] driving two [[propeller]]s. 22 Belleville [[water-tube boiler]]s provided steam to the engines. The engines had a total designed output of {{convert|10600|ihp|0|lk=on}} and gave a top speed of {{convert|16|knots|lk=on}}. At full load she carried {{convert|1100|LT|MT|0}} of coal that provided her a range of {{convert|2100|nmi|lk=on}} at a speed of {{convert|10|kn}}. ''Ioann Zlatoust'' ran her propulsion [[sea trial|trials]] on 26 July 1910 and reached a maximum speed of {{convert|16.2|kn}} and her engines produced a total of {{convert|10623|ihp}}. The navy was not satisfied and ran another test on 11 August which revealed cracks in the port engine's medium pressure cylinder. A final test was run on 29 November and the ship's horsepower increased slightly to {{convert|10990|ihp}}.<ref>McLaughlin 2003, pp. 148, 151<U+2013>52</ref>

''Ioann Zlatoust''{{'}}s [[Obukhovskii 12"/40 Pattern 1895 gun|Obukhovskii 12-inch Pattern 1895]] 40-[[caliber (artillery)|calibre]] guns were mounted in two twin-gun turrets, one each fore and aft. Each turret had a firing arc of 260<U+00B0>.<ref>McLaughlin 2003, pp. 148, 150</ref> All four {{convert|8|in|adj=on|0}} 50-calibre Pattern 1905 guns were mounted in the corners of the superstructure in armoured [[casemate]]s. These guns had a firing arc of 120<U+00B0> and could fire straight ahead or astern. The dozen {{convert|6|in|adj=on|0}} [[Canet guns|Canet Pattern]] 1892 45-calibre guns were mounted in the lower [[casemate]]s. The anti-[[torpedo boat]] armament consisted of 14 {{convert|75|mm|adj=on}} Canet Pattern 1892 50-calibre guns mounted in sponsons on the upper deck, protected by gun shields.<ref name=m50>McLaughlin 2003, p. 150</ref> She carried two {{convert|17.7|in|mm|adj=on}} [[torpedo tube]]s on the [[broadside]] aft.<ref name=m51>McLaughlin 2003, p. 151</ref>

===Wartime modifications===
''Ioann Zlatoust'' was fitted with [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft guns]] on top of each of her turrets during 1915 and screens were added on top of her funnels to keep out light bombs. She was initially received four 75-millimetre guns, but this was later altered to a pair of 75&nbsp;mm guns and another pair of {{convert|63.5|mm|adj=on|1}} guns.<ref>McLaughlin 2003, p. 310</ref>

==Service history==
Construction of ''Ioann Zlatoust'' began on 14 November 1903, well before the formal keel-laying ceremony on 13 November 1904. Progress was relatively quick, despite the disruptions caused by the [[1905 Russian Revolution|1905 Revolution]], and she was [[launched (ship)|launched]] on 13 May 1906. [[Fitting-out]], however, was considerably delayed by a number of changes made as the navy digested the lessons of the Russo-Japanese War, for example there was a period of seven months in 1907 where virtually no work was done on the ship and she was not completed until 1 April 1911.{{awkward}} ''Ioann Zlatoust''{{'}}s turrets had originally been intended for a reconstruction of the elderly pre-dreadnought {{ship|Russian battleship|Chesma|1886|2}}, but they were diverted to ''Ioann Zlatoust'' after that reconstruction was cancelled.<ref>McLaughlin 2003, pp. 147, 149<U+2013>50, 152</ref> 

Before the beginning of [[World War I]] the Black Sea Fleet experimented with concentrating fire from several ships under the control of a "master ship". They had to be identically armed and were equipped with additional [[radio]] gear to transmit and receive range and deflection data. ''Ioann Zlatoust'' became the master ship for the Black Sea Fleet, working with ''Evstafi'' and {{ship|Russian battleship|Pantelimon||2}}.<ref>Friedman, pp. 272<U+2013>73</ref>
 
Two weeks after the Russian declaration of war on the [[Ottoman Empire]] on 2 November 1914, the Black Sea Fleet, comprising the pre-dreadnoughts ''Evstafi'', ''Ioann Zlatoust'', ''Pantelimon'', {{ship|Russian battleship|Rostislav||2}}, {{ship|Russian battleship|Tri Sviatitelia||2}}, and three cruisers were escorted by three [[destroyer]]s and 11 [[torpedo boat]]s set out on 15 November to bombard [[Trebizond]]. They did this successfully on the morning of 17 November and they turned west to hunt for Turkish shipping along the [[Anatolia]]n coast before setting course for Sevastopol later that afternoon. They were intercepted by the German battlecruiser ''Goeben'' and the [[light cruiser]] {{SMS|Breslau}} the following day in what came to be known as the Battle of Cape Sarych. Despite the noon hour the conditions were foggy and the capital ships initially did not spot each other. ''Evstafi'' was the lead ship, but held her fire until ''Ioann Zlatoust'', the master ship, could see ''Goeben''. When the gunnery commands were finally received they showed a range over {{convert|4000|yd}} in excess of ''Evstafi''{{'}}s own estimate of {{convert|7700|yd}}, so ''Evstafi'' opened fire using her own data before the ''Goeben'' turned to unmask its broadside. ''Evstafi'' scored a hit with her first salvo as a 12-inch shell partially penetrated the armor casemate protecting one of ''Goeben''{{'}}s {{convert|15|cm|adj=on|1}} secondary guns. It detonated some of the ready-use ammunition, starting a fire that burnt out the casemate and killed its crew.<ref>McLaughlin 2003, pp. 302<U+2013>03</ref> That was, however, the only hit on ''Goeben'', although it caused her to disengage from the Russian squadron. ''Ioann Zlatoust'' only fired six shells herself as only her forward turret could see ''Goeben''.<ref>McLaughlin 2001, pp. 127, 129, 133</ref><!--"only" twice in one sentence, needs to be fixed.-->

On 9 January 1915 ''Breslau'' and the {{ship|Ottoman cruiser|Hamidiye}} encountered the Russian fleet while returning from a mission in the eastern part of the Black Sea. ''Breslau'' hit ''Evstafi''{{'}}s forward turret, temporarily putting it out of action, and the two cruisers escaped using their superior speed.<ref name=m52>McLaughlin 2003, p. 152</ref> ''Evstafi'' and ''Ioann Zlatoust'' served as the covering force for several bombardment missions of the [[Bosphorus]] between 18 March and 9 May 1915. The two earlier bombardments were uneventful, but the 9 May bombardment provoked a reaction as ''Goeben'' intercepted the Russian battleships after they had been spotted by the {{ship|Ottoman destroyer|Numune-i Hamiyet}}. Both forces turned on parallel courses and opened fire at the range of {{convert|17400|yd}}. Neither side scored a hit although ''Goeben'' had multiple near-misses on ''Evstafi''. [[Vice Admiral]] [[Andrei Eberhardt]] ordered his ships to make only {{convert|5|kn}} while ''Goeben'' was making {{convert|25|kn}}. ''Goeben'' was unable to [[Crossing the T|cross the T]] of the Russian ships, despite its superior speed, as they were continually turning. This manoeuvre bought enough time that ''Tri Sviatitelia'' and ''Pantelimon'' were able to rejoin the other two ships before they could start shelling the Ottoman forts. ''Pantelimon''  hit ''Goeben'' twice before the German ship broke contact after 22 minutes of firing. With the fleet assembled Admiral Eberhardt attempted to pursue the enemy battlecruiser, but was unsuccessful.<ref>Nekrasov, pp. 55<U+2013>57</ref>

On 1 August 1915, ''Ioann Zlatoust'' and all the other pre-dreadnoughts were transferred to the 2nd Battleship Brigade, after the dreadnought {{ship|Russian battleship|Imperatritsa Mariya||2}} entered service. On 1 October the new dreadnought provided cover while ''Ioann Zlatoust'' and ''Pantelimon'' bombarded [[Zonguldak]] and ''Evstafi'' shelled the nearby town of Kozlu.<ref>McLaughlin 2003, p. 304</ref> Both ''Evstafi''-class ships participated in the second bombardment of [[Varna]] in May 1916.<ref>Nekrasov, pp. 90<U+2013>92</ref>

''Evstafi'' and ''Ioann Zlatoust'' were reduced to reserve in March 1918 in Sevastopol. Immobile, they were captured by the Germans there in May and handed over to the Allies the following December. The British wrecked their engines 22<U+2013>24 April 1919 when they left the [[Crimea]] to prevent the advancing Bolsheviks from using them against the White Russians. They were captured by both sides during the [[Russian Civil War]], but were abandoned by the White Russians when they evacuated the Crimea in November 1920. The ships was scrapped in 1922<U+2013>23, although they were not stricken from the Navy List until 21 November 1925.<ref name=m52/>
