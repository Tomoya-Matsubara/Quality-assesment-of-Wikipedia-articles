The '''South Sydney Rabbitohs''', also known as '''Souths''' or '''The Rabbits''', are an [[Australia|Australian]] professional [[rugby league]] team based in [[Sydney]], Australia. They participate in the [[National Rugby League|National Rugby League (NRL)]] and are one of the nine teams from Sydney. The club was founded in [[New South Wales Rugby League season 1908|1908]] and was one of the foundation members in the [[New South Wales Rugby League]] [[New South Wales Rugby League premiership|premiership]], the predecessor of the current NRL competition. They are one of only two foundation clubs still present in the league, the other being the [[Sydney Roosters]].<ref>In Australia, a foundation club is one that played in the first season of a competition. South Sydney played in the first season of the [[New South Wales Rugby League premiership]], the predecessor to the [[National Rugby League]] competition.</ref>

The Rabbitohs' traditional heartland covers the traditionally working class suburbs on the southern edges of Sydney city however they have long held a wide supporter base spread all over country [[New South Wales]]. Previous home grounds have included [[Redfern Oval]] and [[Aussie Stadium]], and currently [[Telstra Stadium]] at [[Sydney Olympic Park]]. 

At the elite competition level,<ref>[[National Rugby League]] (1998-present) , [[Australian Rugby League]] (1995-1997) and [[New South Wales Rugby League premiership|New South Wales Rugby League ]] (1908-1994) competitions.</ref> South Sydney are the most successful professional team in the history of [[Rugby league in Australia|Australian rugby league]], having won [[South Sydney Rabbitohs competition honours|20 first grade premierships]]. However, they have not won a premiership since [[New South Wales Rugby League season 1971|1971]], and last made the playoffs in [[New South Wales Rugby League season 1989|1989]].

The South Sydney District Rugby League Football Club was formed at a meeting on [[17 January]] [[1908]] at [[Redfern, New South Wales|Redfern]] Town Hall<ref name="rl1908">[http://rl1908.com/Clubs/South-Sydney-Rabbitohs.htm South Sydney Rabbitohs] ''RL1908.com'' by Sean Fagan.</ref> when administrator [[J J Giltinan]], cricketer [[Victor Trumper]] and politician Henry Clement Hoyle came together in front of a large crowd of supporters.<ref name="Pride of the League">Ian Heads, ''South Sydney, Pride of the League'', Lothian, 2000.</ref> The club played in the first round of the newly-formed [[New South Wales Rugby League premiership|New South Wales Rugby League]], defeating [[North Sydney Bears|North Sydney]] 11<U+2013>7 at Birchgrove Oval on [[20 April]] [[New South Wales Rugby League season 1908|1908]].<ref name="Pride of the League">Ian Heads, ''South Sydney, Pride of the League'', Lothian, 2000.</ref><ref>[http://stats.rleague.com/rl/seas/1908.html Season 1908] from the [http://stats.rleague.com/rl/rl_index.html Rugby League Tables & Statistics website].</ref> The team went on to win the inaugural premiership then successfully defended their title in the [[New South Wales Rugby League season 1909|1909 season]], winning the [[Grand Final]] by default.<ref>[http://www.rl1908.com/articles/balmain-1909.htm "The Balmainiacs of 1909"] ''RL1908.com'' by Sean Fagan.</ref> After further premiership success in [[New South Wales Rugby League season 1914|1914]] and [[New South Wales Rugby League season 1918|1918]], South Sydney won seven of the eight premierships from 1925<U+2013>1932, only missing out in 1930.

Such was Souths dominance in the early years of the rugby league competition that the Rabbitohs were labelled "The Pride of the League".<ref>In 1925 rugby league journalist Claude Corbett nicknamed the club the "Pride of the League" - see page 3 of Ian Heads' book ''South Sydney, Pride of the League'', Lothian, 2000.

In the 1950s South Sydney again had great success, winning five of the six premierships from 1950<U+2013>[[New South Wales Rugby League season 1955|1955]], and losing the 1952 Grand Final against [[Western Suburbs Magpies|Western Suburbs]] in controversial circumstances.

In the late 1950s Souths began a poor run of form failing to make the finals from 1958<U+2013>[[New South Wales Rugby League season 1964|1964]]. However in [[New South Wales Rugby League season 1965|1965]] a talented young side made the Grand Final against [[St. George Dragons|St. George]] who were aiming to secure their 10th straight premiership. The young Rabbitohs weren't owerawed by the Dragons formidable experience and in front of a record crowd of 78,056<ref>[http://www.sydneycricketground.com.au/Record-Crowds.html Record Crowds] from the ''Sydney Cricket Ground - Aussie Stadium'' website.</ref> at the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]], they went down narrowly 12<U+2013>8.<ref>[http://stats.rleague.com/rl/seas/1965.html Season 1965] from the [http://stats.rleague.com/rl/rl_index.html Rugby League Tables & Statistics website].</ref> The nucleus of this side went on to feature in [[Australia national rugby league team|Australian representative teams]] for the next six years and ensured another golden period for South Sydney making five successive grand finals from 1967<U+2013>[[New South Wales Rugby League season 1971|1971]], winning four.

Financial problems started to hit Souths in the early 1970s, forcing some players to go to other clubs. The licensed Leagues Club, traditionally such an important revenue provider to all first grade league sides, was closed in 1973 but a "Save Our Souths" campaign ensured the club survived. "Super Coach" [[Jack Gibson (rugby league)|Jack Gibson]]'s<ref>Reference to Jack Gibson as a "Super Coach" is common terminology in Australian rugby league circles given Gibson's outstanding coaching record - see: [[Australian Associated Press]], [http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/08/14/1060588510800.html?from=storyrhs Super coach Gibson salutes his favourite players,]''The Sydney Morning Herald'', [[14 August]], [[2003]].</ref> arrival turned the club's form, winning the pre-season competition in 1978.<ref name="Pride of the League">Ian Heads, ''South Sydney, Pride of the League'', Lothian, 2000.</ref> The club captured victories in the mid-week [[Amco Cup|Tooth Cup]] competition in [[New South Wales Rugby League season 1981|1981]]<ref>See the article ''10 of the Best - 1981: The Droughtbreaker'' by Glenn Jackson in ''Souths The People's Team'', edited by Angus Fontaine, League Week, ACP Publishing, 2002.</ref> and in the pre-season [[Rugby League World Sevens|"Sevens"]] competition in 1988.<ref name="Pride of the League">Ian Heads, ''South Sydney, Pride of the League'', Lothian, 2000.</ref> The Rabbitohs were able to make the finals on five occasions in the 1980s, including a dominant season to finish as minor premiers in [[New South Wales Rugby League season 1989|1989]].<ref name="Pride of the League">Ian Heads, ''South Sydney, Pride of the League'', Lothian, 2000.</ref> The [[New South Wales Rugby League season 1989|1989 season]] proved to be the club's most successful in years, but also marked the last time the club has been able to reach the finals. The following season the Rabbitohs finished as [[wooden spoon]]ers.

The club stayed afloat in the 1990s despite major financial problems. Souths' only success came in [[New South Wales Rugby League season 1994|1994]] when they won the pre-season competition, defeating the [[Brisbane Broncos]] 27<U+2013>26 in the final.<ref name="Pride of the League">Ian Heads, ''South Sydney, Pride of the League'', Lothian, 2000.</ref> The [[Super League (Australia)|Super League War]] and the eventual formation of the [[National Rugby League]] affected the club greatly when it was determined in 1998 that the newly formed competition would be contracted to 14 teams for the 2000 season. Following a series of mergers by other teams South Sydney failed to meet the NRL's selection criteria to compete in the competition and were subsequently excluded from the premiership at the end of the [[National Rugby League season 1999|1999 season]].

In 2000 and 2001, South Sydney fought their way back into the competition following a string of high profile legal battles against the National Rugby League and [[News Limited]].<ref>See [http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0521534275&id=Dt_XdDY-VbMC&pg=PA228&lpg=PA228&ots=NtnPyY50gG&dq=south+sydney+Rabbitohs&sig=IZrsqyQ3wNtujSROFxFVmKs-LVs#PPA227,M1 "Grassroots Ethics: The Case of Souths versus News Corporation"], pages 216-229 of ''Remote Control: New Media, New Ethics'' by Michael Moller, edited by Catharine Lumby and Elspeth Probyn, Cambridge University Press, 2003 at [http://books.google.com Google Books]</ref> A number of well attended public rallies took place during this time, as supporters from many different clubs got behind South Sydney's case. Upon appeal to the [[Federal Court of Australia|Federal Court]] in 2001,<ref>See [http://janus.law.usyd.edu.au/slr/docs_pdfs/editions/slr_v24_n4_bhc.pdf Before the High Court - Sport and the Law: The South Sydney Appeal] by Saul Fridman.</ref> South Sydney won readmission into the premiership for the [[National Rugby League season 2002|2002 season]].<ref name="Souths Revival">See [http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN1865089184&id=Y_KSvEkUUNIC&pg=PA150&lpg=PA150&ots=N183KHJT2w&dq=rabbitohs&sig=VND-p2NDomWFLlcBM-6_YW0uCBM#PPA150,M1 "The Souths Revival"], page 150 of ''Strategic Sports Marketing'' by David Shilbury, Shayne Quick and Hans Westerbeek, Allen & Unwin, 2003 at [http://books.google.com Google Books]</ref>

Since being readmitted, the Rabbitohs have been rather unsuccessful in the premiership, finishing amongst the bottom three teams for five seasons straight including three [[wooden spoon]]s. However, following the club's takeover by famous Hollywood actor [[Russell Crowe]] and [[Peter Holmes a Court]] in 2006,<ref>[http://www.souths.com.au/fanzone/viewnewsarticle.asp?ArticleID=1553 New Era at Souths Begins Today With Official Handover Ceremony] from the official South Sydney website.</ref> the club has had great success in securing a number of major player signings as well as recruiting several key managerial positions including [[Jason Taylor (rugby league footballer)|Jason Taylor]] as head coach.

==Crest==
[[Image:Souths_emblem_orig.JPG|frame|right|100px|The original Rabbitohs emblem introduced in [[New South Wales Rugby League season 1959|1959]]]]
One version of how the club got the "Rabbitohs" nickname comes from their [[rugby union]] days at the turn of the 20th century. In those hard times, players wearing their [[cardinal red]] and [[myrtle (color)|myrtle green]] football jumpers, earned some extra money on Saturday mornings by hawking rabbits around the district with the traditional cry of "Rabbitoh!" echoing through the narrow streets.<ref>See the comments of reporter Roy Masters of ''The Sydney Morning Herald'' from the transcript of the Channel 9 ''Sunday'' TV program cover story: [http://sunday.ninemsn.com.au/sunday/cover_stories/transcript_1012.asp "The Resurrection of the Rabbitohs".]</ref> As they made a sale, they would sling the bunny from their shoulder and skin it on the spot, inevitably accumulating some of the fur and blood on their jerseys as they did so. When they played in those blood stained jumpers that afternoon, opponents from wealthier rugby clubs did not always appreciate the aroma and would mockingly repeat the "Rabbitoh!" cry.<ref>See the comments of ABC radio reporter Joe O'Brien from the transcript of the ABC ''PM'' radio program  [http://www.abc.net.au/pm/stories/s324987.htm "Rabbitohs continue historic form",]broadcast on Friday, 6 July, 2001.</ref> 

Another account of the legend relates that the Rabbitoh name was a disparaging reference by opposing teams to South's home ground being plagued with "rabbit 'oles". In those early days [[Redfern Oval]] was then known as Nathan's Cow Paddock.<ref name="rl1908">[http://rl1908.com/Clubs/South-Sydney-Rabbitohs.htm South Sydney Rabbitohs] ''RL1908.com'' by Sean Fagan.</ref> Yet another version links the Rabbitoh name as being adopted from that of the touring [[Australia national rugby union team|Australian rugby union]] teams of the early 1900s who where nicknamed "Rabbits" prior to discarding the name in 1908 in favour of the moniker "Wallabies".<ref name="New Speculations">[http://www.rl1908.com/clubcomps/origins.htm "Club Histories - New Speculations"] ''RL1908.com'' by Sean Fagan.</ref>

The "Rabbitoh" emblem (a white running rabbit) first appeared on the team's jersey in [[New South Wales Rugby League season 1959|1959]]. The Rabbitoh emblem has in various forms been carried as the club's crest on all players jerseys ever since. The original "Rabbitoh" emblem design that appeared on the team's jerseys throughout the 1960s and 1970's has now been incorporated on the current jersey.

==Colours==
[[Image:Minties_jersey.jpg|150px|thumb|left|South Sydney "Minties" jersey of the early 1980s.]]
South Sydney has used [[cardinal red]] and [[myrtle (color)|myrtle green]] colours on its playing jerseys for the vast majority of the club's history. Some sources have suggested that this combination of colours was due to the local [[rugby union]] club being nicknamed the "Redfern Waratahs". The first British inhabitants had often called the [[waratah]] a "red fern" instead, hence giving the suburb its name, and ultimately the local rugby club its emblem. Red and green dominate the colours of the waratah and hence, possibly, the South Sydney Rugby League Football Club adopted these colours for their jerseys.<ref name="New Speculations">[http://www.rl1908.com/clubcomps/origins.htm "Club Histories - New Speculations"] ''RL1908.com'' by Sean Fagan.</ref>

The club's jersey has been a hooped-styled one comprising of alternating red and green, and has been used for the vast majority of the club's history.<ref>[http://www.souths.com.au/shop/viewproduct.asp?ProductID=277 South Sydney traditional jersey] from the official South Sydney website.</ref> In 1945 and 1946 the club broke with this tradition and used a green design with a red "V" around the collar, before reverting back to the original hoop style. From [[New South Wales Rugby League season 1980|1980]] to 1984 the team played in a strip which saw the inclusion of white hoops within a predominately green design with a central red stripe and was affectionately known as the "Minties"<ref>See the article ''Having a "Mintie wrapper" in your wardrobe'' by Mark Courtney in ''Souths The People's Team'', edited by Angus Fontaine, League Week, ACP Publishing, 2002.</ref> jersey (so-called due to its apparent similarity to the wrapper design of the popular candy).<ref>See [http://www.souths.com.au/fanzone/viewnewsarticle.asp?ArticleID=783 '80s Week] from the official South Sydney website.</ref> <!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Asotasibunnies.jpg|150px|thumb|right|[[Roy Asotasi]] wearing the 2007 South Sydney jersey.]] -->With the introduction of "away" jerseys towards the end of the [[20th Century]], the club initially introduced a predominantly white jersey for away matches which was changed to a predominantly black one for the [[National Rugby League season 2006|2006 season]].

Before the start of the [[National Rugby League season 2007|2007 season]], the club announced that the away jersey would be styled identically to the traditional home jersey, with the exception of sponsorship and the rabbit emblem, which as been styled similarly to the one that initially featured on jerseys in the 1960s.<ref>[http://www.souths.com.au/shop/viewproduct.asp?ProductID=522 South Sydney 2007 home jersey] from the official South Sydney website.</ref> For home matches, the rabbit emblem will remain white and for away matches the emblem will be black.<ref>[http://www.souths.com.au/shop/viewproduct.asp?ProductID=563 South Sydney 2007 alternate (away) jersey] from the official South Sydney website.</ref>

The playing shorts worn were historically black, though in the late 1970s the club adopted green shorts with a red vertical stripe. This was then superceded by the white shorts of the "Minties" outfit. When the club subsequently reverted to their traditional playing strip, the decision was made to wear black shorts once more.

==Stadium==
[[Image:Aussie Stadium.jpg|left|thumb|250px|The [[Sydney Football Stadium]] as it appears whilst hosting a [[National Rugby League]] finals match.]]
During the early years of the [[New South Wales Rugby League premiership]], "home games" were not assigned as readily as they are today. However, South Sydney played most of their games at the [[Sydney Showground|Royal Agricultural Society Ground]] from 1908 until the club's final departure in 1920. From 1911 onwards, the [[Sydney Sports Ground]] was also used interchangeably with the Agricultural Ground over a decade for hosting matches.<ref>[http://www.angelfire.com/nb/coop/zSOUTH_SYDNEY.htm South Sydney] Co-op.</ref> In 1947 the club played its final season at the Sports Ground, before relocating to [[Redfern Oval]] in 1948.<ref>[http://stats.rleague.com/rl/venues/redfern.html Redfern Oval] from the [http://stats.rleague.com/rl/rl_index.html Rugby League Tables & Statistics website].</ref> It was here that team played in the heart of the club's territory and played the vast majority of its allocated home matches for an extended period of time.

In 1988, the club began to play in the newly-built [[Sydney Football Stadium]],<ref>[http://stats.rleague.com/rl/venues/s.f.s..html Sydney Football Stadium] from the [http://stats.rleague.com/rl/rl_index.html Rugby League Tables & Statistics website].</ref> built upon the former Sydney Sports Ground and Sydney Cricket Ground No. 2 Oval. [[Image:Panorama-TelstraStadium-Oct2005.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Telstra Stadium]] the Rabbitohs current home ground.]]The side continued to play here up until 2005, with the exception of 2000 and 2001 during South Sydney's absence from the premiership. In 2006 the club relocated games to [[Telstra Stadium]] in [[Sydney]]'s west, where it continues to be stationed for home matches until the club's contract with Telstra Stadium ends at the end of 2008.

Currently $19.5 million is being spent by the [[City of Sydney|City of Sydney Council]]<ref name="Redfern Park upgrade">[http://www.cityofsydney.nsw.gov.au/Development/CityImprovements/RedfernParkUpgrade.asp Proposed Redfern Park Upgrade,] on the [[City of Sydney]] website.</ref> to completely upgrade and renovate Redfern Oval which will allow the Rabbitohs to return to Redfern in 2008 for training as well as the option of hosting minor pre-season and exhibition matches.<ref name="Redfern Park upgrade">[http://www.cityofsydney.nsw.gov.au/Development/CityImprovements/RedfernParkUpgrade.asp Proposed Redfern Park Upgrade,] on the [[City of Sydney]] website.</ref>

==Supporters==
The Rabbitohs continue to have a large supporter base in their traditional areas of [[South-eastern Sydney|South-Eastern Sydney]], despite having moved from Redfern Oval many years ago. The main South Sydney supporters group at matches is known as "The Burrow."<ref>[http://www.theburrow.com.au/about_us.html The Burrow website.]</ref> The club also enjoys wide support throughout other rugby league playing centres around the country.<ref>[http://www.souths.com.au/fanzone/supportergroups.asp South Sydney supporter groups] from the official South Sydney website.</ref>

Souths Sydney's bid for reinstatement, following their exclusion from the competition at the end of the 1999 season, saw a sustained campaign of public support unprecedented in Australian sporting history.

==Rivalries==
The Rabbitohs and their fans have built up rivalries with other clubs, particularly the [[Sydney Roosters]], the other remaining foundation club. The Rabbitohs and the Roosters share inner-Sydney territory, causing a strong rivalry since 1908. The rivalry increased after 1950 due to conflict between junior territories.<ref>Will Swanton,  [http://www.smh.com.au/news/league/shove-thy-neighbour-souths-rule-the-roost/2005/08/20/1124435184478.html Shove thy neighbour: Souths rule the roost] ''The Sydney Morning Herald.''

Other long-time traditional rivals include the [[Manly Sea Eagles]] and former clubs the [[St George Dragons]] and [[Balmain Tigers]].

[[Eric Simms]] holds the club record for the most points, tallying 1841 points between 1965 and 1975.<ref name="NRL">[http://www.nrl.com.au/Clubs/Rabbitohs/RabbitohsClubRecords/tabid/327/Default.aspx Rabbitohs Club Records] from the official NRL website.</ref> [[John Graves|Johnny Graves]]' tally of 29 points in a match against [[Sydney Roosters|Eastern Suburbs]] in 1952<ref name="NRL">[http://www.nrl.com.au/Clubs/Rabbitohs/RabbitohsClubRecords/tabid/327/Default.aspx Rabbitohs Club Records] from the official NRL website.</ref> remains the club record for the most individual points in a match. Had this feat been scored as it is today it would have stood at 32 points. Eric Simms scored 265 points on his own for South Sydney in 1969 and this tally along with ones achieved in 1970 and 1967 remain unsurpassed by any other player at the club.<ref name="NRL">[http://www.nrl.com.au/Clubs/Rabbitohs/RabbitohsClubRecords/tabid/327/Default.aspx Rabbitohs Club Records] from the official NRL website.</ref> The 1969 tally was once a league record, and has since been broken by a number of players at other clubs. 

Eric Simms still holds a club and competition record for the most number of goals (112 goals and 19 field goals) in a season, most career field goals (86) and most field goals in a game (5).

Between 1921 and 1933 [[Benny Wearing]] scored 144 tries in his 172 games for the club,<ref name="NRL">[http://www.nrl.com.au/Clubs/Rabbitohs/RabbitohsClubRecords/tabid/327/Default.aspx Rabbitohs Club Records] from the official NRL website.</ref> which is an exceptional proportion of tries per games played. [[Les Brennan]]'s 29 tries in 19 games in 1954 remain a club record,<ref name="NRL">[http://www.nrl.com.au/Clubs/Rabbitohs/RabbitohsClubRecords/tabid/327/Default.aspx Rabbitohs Club Records] from the official NRL website.</ref> having broken [[John Graves|Johnny Graves]]' tally of 28 in 17 games set just three years earlier. During his career Bob McCarthy scored 100 tries for the club, the most by a forward.<ref name="NRL">[http://www.nrl.com.au/Clubs/Rabbitohs/RabbitohsClubRecords/tabid/327/Default.aspx Rabbitohs Club Records] from the official NRL website.</ref>

The Rabbitohs have won the most first grade premierships, [[South Sydney Rabbitohs competition honours|20]] in all.<ref name="NRL Records">[http://www.nrl.com.au/PremiershipRecords/tabid/292/Default.aspx NRL Premiership records] from the official NRL website.</ref> They have also won the most reserve grade premierships, again 20.

[[Jack Rayner]] holds the individual record of the most grand final successes as a captain (5) and coach (5) achieved between 1950 and 1955.

The club has the distinction of scoring the most points (42), most tries (8) and most goals (9) in a grand final, all achieved against [[Manly Sea Eagles|Manly]] in 1951. 

Souths' 1925 first grade side is one of six NSW sides to ever go through a season undefeated. The club won the premiership in all three grades in 1925, a feat only repeated on three other occasions ([[Balmain Tigers]] in 1915 and 1916 and [[St George Dragons]] in 1963).
