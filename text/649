'''New York State Route 239''' (also known as NY 239) was a state highway in [[Erie County, New York|Erie County]]. It began at an intersection with [[New York State Route 354]] in [[Cowlesville, New York|Cowlesville]]. The route headed northward, ending at [[U.S. Route 20 in New York|U.S. Route 20]] in [[Alden (town), New York|Alden]]. The entirety of NY 239 was only about {{convert|2|mi|km}} in length. However, when first assigned in the [[1930 New York State Route renumbering]], NY 239 stretched into nearby [[Wyoming County, New York|Wyoming County]]. The route was truncated to NY 354 in Cowlesville, and was eventually decommissioned in September 1980, following a maintenance swap several months before. The designation was replaced by Erie County Route 578.

:''Note: This route description is written as the alignment existed before its decommissioning in September 1980.''

Route 239 began at an intersection with [[New York State Route 354]] in Cowlesville. The route then traveled to the northeast and climbed in elevation just after the terminus. The highway then made a turn to the north, descending in elevation. Running at about a height of {{convert|900|ft|m}} above sea level, Route 239 crosses into the town of Alden and continues towards downtown.<ref name="cowlesville">{{cite map|url=http://www.nysgis.state.ny.us/gisdata/quads/drg24/usgspreview/index.cfm?code=o42078g4|title=Cowlesville, New York quadrangle|publisher=United States Geological Survey|cartography=United States Geological Survey|accessdate=2008-10-08|year=1949}}</ref> Route 239 continued northward, passing nearby Henskee Road, which headed eastward and terminated at the Genesee County line. The route dipped in elevation, entering the village of Alden. where nearby, the Buffalo Water Filtration Plant sat to the west as the road traveled across the [[Conrail]] tracks. Route 239 passed through a, primarily, residential area just before terminating at [[U.S. Route 20 in New York|U.S. Route 20]] in Alden.<ref name="alden">{{cite map|title=Corfu, New York quadrangle|publisher=United States Geological Survey|cartography=United States Geological Survey|year=1984}}</ref>

== History ==
Route 239, when first assigned in the [[1930 New York State Route renumbering]],<ref name="1930renum"/> stretched from [[New York State Route 98]] in [[Attica, New York|Attica]], a village in Wyoming County. The route used part of what is now [[New York State Route 354]] through Cowlesville, beyond the county line and into Erie County. Route 239 then went northward along its truncated alignment to an intersection with [[New York State Route 35 (1930s)|New York State Route 35]], where it terminated.<ref name="1931map">{{cite map|title=Road Map of New York|publisher=Socony|year=1931|cartography=Standard Oil Company}}</ref> Route 239 was eventually truncated and was on its current alignment by 1965.<ref name="1965map">{{cite map |title=New York|publisher=[[Mobil]] |year=1965 |cartography=[[Rand McNally]]}}</ref>

The highway lasted another 15 years, until the maintenance swaps between the [[state of New York]] and several different counties occurred in 1980. Several maintenance swaps between the state government and Erie County occurred on April 1. Six roads were turned over by Erie County to the state, and thirteen state highways turned over to the county.<ref name=law>{{cite web|author=[[New York State Legislature]]|url=http://public.leginfo.state.ny.us/menugetf.cgi?COMMONQUERY=LAWS|title=Highway Law, Article 12, Section 341|accessdate=2008-01-22}}</ref> Route 239 ended up being one of the thirteen, being decommissioned completely on September 25 of that year.<ref name="dot"/> Erie County replaced the state designation of NY 239 with County Route 578, stretching from NY 354 to [[U.S. Route 20 in New York|U.S. Route 20]].<ref name="578quad">{{cite map|url=http://www.nysgis.state.ny.us/gisdata/quads/drg24/dotpreview/index.cfm?code=r11|title=Cowlesville, New York quadrangle|publisher=New York State Department of Transportation|cartography=New York State Department of Transportation|year=1998|accessdate=2008-09-26}}</ref>
