==Biography==
Olejniczak was born on August 18, 1908 to John A. and Victoria Olejniczak in [[Green Bay, Wisconsin]]. He was a lifelong resident of the city and on November 24, 1938, married Regina Bettine at [[Cathedral of Saint Francis Xavier in Green Bay|St. Francis Xavier Cathedral]] in [[Green Bay, Wisconsin|Green Bay]]. Dom and Gina adopted two sons, Thomas Marshall Olejniczak and Mark Dominic Olejniczak.<ref name=mayorsofgb>{{cite web |url=http://www.ci.green-bay.wi.us/mayors_past/mayor_olejniczak.html |title=Mayors of Green Bay}}</ref>

Olejniczak served as [[alderman]] from 1936 to 1944 and served as a mayor of Green Bay from 1945 to 1955. During his tenure as mayor, the city of Green Bay built a pipeline to [[Lake Michigan]] for its water supply. Also, the [[beltway|beltline]] around the city was planned and developed under Mr. Olejniczak's supervision.<ref name=mayorsofgb/>

Olejniczak's love for the [[Green Bay Packers]] began when the team was young. He was attending [[Green Bay East High School|East High School]] and lived not far from the stadium which at that time was located on East High School grounds. At that time, a youngster could walk into the stadium with a player and carry his headgear and Dominic was among them. His interest never waned. He continued to be an ardent backer during his years as alderman and as mayor. On July 10, 1950, Olejniczak was named to the Green Bay Packers [[Board of Directors]] and the bond grew stronger. In his dual role as mayor and board member that year, he was a leader in the civic drive that netted more than $100,000 and helped save the franchise.<ref name=packerhof/>

Olejniczak was named to the Executive Committee of the Green Bay Packers Board of Directors in January 1952. Six years later, in 1958, he became President of the only publicly owned [[National Football League]] (NFL) franchise.<ref name=mayorsofgb/> When he took over the Packer presidency the team had not had a winning record in 10 years.<ref name=nytimesobit>{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1989/04/17/obituaries/dominic-olejniczak-sports-executive-80.html |title=Dominic Olejniczak, Sports Executive | work=The New York Times | date=April 17, 1989}}</ref> Olejniczak was a prime mover in building the new City Stadium and was instrumental in hiring [[New York Giants]] assistant [[Vince Lombardi]] in 1959.<ref name=packerhof/> The decision to hire Lombardi led to the most successful era in the team's history as Lombardi led the Packers to five championships.<ref name=nytimesobit/>

After serving 24 years as Packers president, more than anyone in the team's history, Olejniczak resigned as president on June 1, 1982, and was succeeded by [[Robert J. Parins]].<ref name=mayorsofgb/> At that time, Olejniczak was named the first Packer Chairman of the Board and served in that role until 1989. MOlejniczak was inducted into the Green Bay Packer Hall of Fame in 1979.<ref name=packerhof/>

Prior to entering public service, Dominic was a [[real estate broker]].  Olejniczak received the [[Knighthood of St. Gregory]] from Bishop Wycislo and an honorary Doctorate of Law Degree from [[St. Norbert College]] in 1986. He was the first lay President of Premontre High School (later changed to Notre Dame de la Baie Academy).<ref name=mayorsofgb/>

Dominic Olejniczak died at age 80 after suffering numerous [[strokes]].<ref name=mayorsofgb/><ref name=nytimesobit/>
