'''Stephen Joshua Sondheim''' (born March 22, 1930) is an American composer and lyricist for stage and film.  He is the winner of an [[Academy Award]], multiple [[Tony Award]]s (eight, more than any other composer) including the Special Tony Award for Lifetime Achievement in the Theatre,<ref>[http://www.tonyawards.com/en_US/archive/dyk/index.html "Tony Awards Legacy Facts and Trivia"] tonyawards.com, retrieved March 14, 2010</ref> multiple [[Grammy Award]]s, and a [[Pulitzer Prize]]. His most famous scores include (as composer/lyricist) ''[[A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum]]'', ''[[Company (musical)|Company]]'', ''[[Follies]]'', ''[[A Little Night Music]]'', ''[[Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (musical)|Sweeney Todd]]'', ''[[Sunday in the Park with George]]'', ''[[Into the Woods]]'', and ''[[Assassins (musical)|Assassins]]'', as well as the lyrics for ''[[West Side Story]]'' and ''[[Gypsy: A Musical Fable|Gypsy]]''. He was president of the [[Dramatists Guild]] from 1973 to 1981.

== Early years ==
Sondheim was born to a [[Jewish]] family in New York City to Etta Janet (n<U+00E9>e Fox) and Herbert Sondheim.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/books/first/s/secrest-sondheim.html Secrest book]''The New York Times''</ref> He grew up on the [[Upper West Side]] of [[Manhattan]] and later, after his parents divorced, on a farm near [[Doylestown, Pennsylvania]]. Herbert, his father, was a dress manufacturer and Foxy, his mother, designed the dresses. As an only child of well-to-do parents living in [[The San Remo]] on [[Central Park West]], he is described in [[Meryle Secrest]]'s biography, ''Stephen Sondheim: A Life'', as having had an isolated and emotionally neglected childhood. While living in New York, Stephen Sondheim attended the [[Ethical Culture]] affiliated [[Fieldston School]]. Later, Sondheim attended [[George School]], a private [[Quaker]] preparatory school in [[Bucks County, Pennsylvania]], where he wrote his first [[musical theatre|musical]] ("By George!"). He attended [[Camp Androscoggin]].<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/books/first/s/secrest-sondheim.html Secrest book]''The New York Times''</ref> He graduated from the [[New York Military Academy]] in 1946. 

Sondheim traces his interest in theatre to ''[[Very Warm for May]]'', a Broadway musical he saw at age nine. "The curtain went up and revealed a piano," Sondheim recalled.  "A butler took a duster and brushed it up, tinkling the keys. I thought that was thrilling."<ref name= "master">{{cite news|last = Henry|first = William A, III|url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,966141,00.html |title = Master of the Musical; Stephen Sondheim Applies a Relentless|publisher = Time|date = 1987-12-07|accessdate = 2007-03-19}}</ref>

Sondheim recalls "She would hold my hand in theatres."<ref>Secrest, p. 30</ref> His father sought custody of Stephen, but because he had left Foxy for another woman (Alicia), his efforts failed. Herbert and Alicia had two sons together.

== Career ==
=== Mentored by Oscar Hammerstein II ===
At about the age of ten, around the time of his parents' divorce, Sondheim became friends with Jimmy Hammerstein, son of the  lyricist and playwright [[Oscar Hammerstein II]]. The elder Hammerstein became Sondheim's surrogate father, and had a profound influence on him, especially in developing a love for musical theatre. It was at the opening of Hammerstein's musical ''[[South Pacific (musical)|South Pacific]]'' that Sondheim met [[Hal Prince|Harold Prince]], who would later direct many of Sondheim's  shows. While at the [[George School]], Sondheim wrote a comic musical based on the goings-on of his school, entitled ''By George''. It was a major success among his peers, and it considerably buoyed the young songwriter's ego; he took it to Hammerstein, and asked him to evaluate it as though he had no knowledge of its author. Hammerstein said it was the worst thing he had ever seen. "But if you want to know why it's terrible," Hammerstein offered, "I'll tell you." The rest of the day was spent going over the musical, and Sondheim would later say that "in that afternoon I learned more about songwriting and the musical theater than most people learn in a lifetime."<ref>Zadan, Craig, ''Sondheim & Co.'', New York: Harper & Row, 1974 & 1986 p. 4  ISBN 0-06-015649-X</ref>

Thus began one of the most famous apprenticeships in the musical theatre, as Hammerstein designed a kind of course for Sondheim on the construction of a musical. This training primarily involved having Sondheim write four musicals, each with one of the following preconditions:

* Based on a play he admired (which became ''[[All That Glitters (musical)|All That Glitters]]'');
* Based on a play he liked but thought was flawed, choosing the [[Maxwell Anderson]] play ''[[High Tor]]''; 
* Based on an existing novel or [[short story]] not previously dramatized (which became his unfinished ''[[Mary Poppins]]'', not connected to the [[Mary Poppins (film)|musical film]] and [[Mary Poppins (musical)|stage play]] scored by the [[Sherman Brothers]]);
* An original (which became ''Climb High'').

None of these "assignment" musicals were ever produced professionally. ''High Tor'' and ''Mary Poppins'' have never been produced at all; the rights holder for the original ''High Tor'' refused permission and his musical ''Mary Poppins'' was not finished.<ref>Secrest, pp. 78-79</ref>

In 1950, Sondheim graduated [[Latin honors|magna cum laude]] from [[Williams College]] in [[Williamstown, Massachusetts]], where he was a member of [[Beta Theta Pi]] fraternity. He went on to study composition with the composer [[Milton Babbitt]]. Sondheim says that when he asked Babbitt if he could study [[atonality]], Babbitt replied "You haven<U+2019>t exhausted [[tonality|tonal]] resources for yourself yet, so I<U+2019>m not going to teach you
atonal."<ref>Horowitz, Mark Eden, ''Sondheim on Music'', New York: Scarecrow Press, 2003, p. 117, ISBN 978-0-8108-4437-7, ISBN 0-8108-4437-0</ref> Sondheim agreed, and despite frequent [[Consonance and dissonance|dissonance]] and a highly chromatic style, his music remains resolutely [[Diatonic and chromatic|tonal]].

=== Broadway lyricist ===
"A few painful years of struggle" followed for Sondheim, during which he continually auditioned songs, living in his father's dining room to save money; he also spent time in Hollywood writing for the television series ''[[Topper (TV series)|Topper]]''.<ref name= "master"/> He devoured 1940s and '50s films and has called cinema his "basic language."<ref name="rich"/> (His film knowledge got him through ''[[The $64,000 Question]]'' contestant tryouts.) Ironically, Sondheim has expressed his dislike of movie musicals, favoring classic dramas like ''[[Citizen Kane]]'', ''[[The Grapes of Wrath (film)|The Grapes of Wrath]]'', and ''[[A Matter of Life and Death (film)|A Matter of Life and Death]]''. He adds that "studio directors like [[Michael Curtiz]] and [[Raoul Walsh]] <U+2026> were heroes of mine. They went from movie to movie to movie, and every third movie was good and every fifth movie was great. There wasn't any cultural pressure to make art."<ref name="afic">{{cite news |last=Mitchell |first=Elvis |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D04EEDC1139F93BA1575BC0A9659C8B63 |title=Sondheim, Film Aficionado; Choices for Telluride Festival Show Nonmusical Side |publisher=The New York Times |date=2003-08-28 |accessdate=2008-03-28 }}</ref>

In 1954, Sondheim wrote both music and lyrics for ''[[Saturday Night (musical)|Saturday Night]]'', which was never produced on Broadway and was shelved until a 1997 production at [[London]]'s Bridewell Theatre. In 1998 ''Saturday Night'' received a professional recording, followed by a revised version with two new songs and an Off-Broadway run at [[Second Stage Theatre]] in 2000 and a full British premiere with the new songs due in 2009 at London's [[Jermyn Street Theatre]].

Sondheim's big break came when he wrote the lyrics to ''[[West Side Story]]'', lyricizing [[Leonard Bernstein]]'s music and [[Arthur Laurents]]'s book. The 1957 show, directed by [[Jerome Robbins]], ran for 732 performances. While this may be the best-known show Sondheim ever worked on, he has expressed dissatisfaction with his lyrics, stating they don't always fit the characters and are sometimes too consciously poetic. It has been rumored that while Bernstein was off trying to fix the musical ''[[Candide (operetta)|Candide]]'', Sondheim wrote some of the music for ''West Side Story'', and that Bernstein<U+2019>s co-lyricist billing mysteriously disappeared from the credits of ''West Side Story'' during the tryout, presumably as a trade-off.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Suskin |first=Steven |year=1990 |title=Opening Night on Broadway: A Critical Quotebook of the Golden Era of the Musical Theatre |location=New York |publisher=Schirmer Books |page=697 |isbn=0028726251 }}</ref> 

In 1959, he wrote the lyrics for the musical, ''[[Gypsy: A Musical Fable|Gypsy]]''. Sondheim would have liked to write the music as well, but [[Ethel Merman]], the star, insisted on a composer with a track record.  Thus, [[Jule Styne]] was hired.<ref>Zadan, p.38</ref> Sondheim questioned if he should write only the lyrics for yet another show, but [[Oscar Hammerstein II|Hammerstein]] told him writing for a star would be valuable experience. Sondheim worked closely with book writer Arthur Laurents to create the show. It ran 702 performances.

Eventually Sondheim wrote both the music and lyrics, for ''[[A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum]]''. It opened in 1962 and ran 964 performances. The book, based on the farces of [[Plautus]], was written by [[Burt Shevelove]] and [[Larry Gelbart]]. Sondheim's score was not especially well-received at the time. Even though the show won several [[Tony Award]]s, including best musical, Sondheim did not even receive a nomination. In addition, some critics felt the songs were not properly integrated into the farcical action.

At this point, Sondheim had participated in three straight hits. His next show ended the streak. ''[[Anyone Can Whistle]]'' (1964) was a 9-performance flop, although it introduced [[Angela Lansbury]] to musical theatre and has developed a [[cult following]].

In 1965 he wrote the lyrics only for ''[[Do I Hear a Waltz?]]'', with music by [[Richard Rodgers]]. He has said that this is the one project he has regretted.<ref name="rich"/> In 1966, he semi-anonymously provided the lyric for "[[The Boy From...]]", a parody of "[[The Girl from Ipanema]]", a highlight of the off-Broadway revue ''[[The Mad Show]]''. (The official songwriting credit went to the linguistically-minded pseudonym "Esteban Rio Nido", which translates from the Spanish to "Stephen River Nest". In the show's [[Programme (booklet)|playbill]], the lyrics are credited to "[[pen name|Nom De Plume]]".) In 1968, he wrote the lyrics for ''[[The Race to Urga]]'', with [[Leonard Bernstein]].

=== Collaborations with Hal Prince (1970<U+2013>1981) ===
Since then Sondheim has devoted himself to both composing and writing lyrics for a series of varied and adventurous musicals, beginning with the innovative "concept musical" ''[[Company (musical)|Company]]'' in 1970.

Sondheim's work is notable for his use of complex [[polyphony]] in the vocal parts, such as the chorus of five minor characters who function as a sort of [[Greek chorus]] in 1973's ''[[A Little Night Music]]''. He also displays a penchant for angular harmonies and intricate melodies reminiscent of [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]] (Sondheim has claimed that he "loves Bach" but his favorite period is [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]] to [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]]).<ref name="Bach">interview on ''Sunday Arts'', ABC (Australia) TV August 5, 2007 ''An Audience With Stephen Sondheim''[http://www.abc.net.au/tv/sundayarts/txt/s1994677.htm 2007 ABC Australia TV interview] downloadable [http://www.abc.net.au/tv/sundayarts/video/ ("Episode 26")]</ref> To [[Fan (person)|aficionados]], Sondheim's musical sophistication is considered to be greater than that of many of his musical theatre peers, and his lyrics are likewise renowned for their [[ambiguity]], wit, and urbanity.

Sondheim collaborated with producer/director [[Hal Prince|Harold Prince]] on six musicals between 1970 and 1981. ''[[Company (musical)|Company]]'' (1970) centered on a set of characters and themes rather than a straightforward plot. ''[[Follies]]'' (1971) was similarly-structured, filled with pastiche songs echoing styles of earlier composers. ''[[A Little Night Music]]'' (1973), a more traditionally plotted show based on the film ''[[Smiles of a Summer Night]]'' by [[Ingmar Bergman]], was one of his greatest successes. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine called it "Sondheim's most brilliant accomplishment to date."<ref name= "perf">{{cite news|url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,906953,00.html |title = A Precious Fancy|publisher = Time|date = 1973-03-19|accessdate = 2007-03-19}}</ref> Notably, the score was mostly composed in [[Time signature|waltz time]] (either <U+00BE> time, or multiples thereof.) Further success was accorded to ''A Little Night Music'' when "Send in the Clowns" became a hit single for [[Judy Collins]]. Although it was Sondheim's only Top 40 hit, his songs are frequently performed and recorded by cabaret artists and theatre singers in their solo careers.

''By Bernstein'' premiered at the off-Broadway [[Westside Theatre]] on November 23, 1975 and closed on December 7, 1975. It ran for 17 performances and 40 previews. The lyrics and music were by [[Leonard Bernstein]], with additional lyrics from other lyricists, including Sondheim. It was conceived and written by [[Betty Comden]] and [[Adolph Green]]. The production was directed by Michael Bawtree with a cast of Jack Bittner, Margery Cohen, Jim Corti, [[Ed Dixon]], [[Patricia Elliott]], Kurt Peterson, and [[Janie Sell]]. The two known songs that had Sondheim contributions are "In There" from the adaption of ''[[The Exception and the Rule]]'' (which would later be named ''[[The Race to Urga]]'') and a cut song from ''[[West Side Story]]'' "Kids Ain't (Like Everybody Else)".<ref>http://www.sondheimguide.com/other.html</ref>

''[[Pacific Overtures]]'' (1976) was the most non-traditional of the Sondheim-Prince collaborations, an intellectual exploration of the westernization of Japan. ''[[Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (musical)|Sweeney Todd]]'' (1979), Sondheim's most operatic score and [[libretto]] (which, along with ''A Little Night Music'', has been seen in opera houses), once again explores an unlikely topic, this time murderous revenge and [[cannibalism]]. The book, by [[Hugh Wheeler]], is based on [[Christopher Bond]]'s 1973 stage version of the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] original.<ref>Berkvist, Robert.

Larryavisbrown.homestead.com, retrieved March 22, 2010</ref>

''[[Merrily We Roll Along (musical)|Merrily We Roll Along]]'' (1981), with a book by [[George Furth]], is one of Sondheim's more "traditional" scores and was thought to hold potential to generate some hit songs ([[Frank Sinatra]] and [[Carly Simon]] each recorded a different song from the show). Sondheim's [[music director]], [[Paul Gemignani]], said, <U+201C>Part of Steve<U+2019>s ability is this extraordinary versatility.<U+201D>  ''Merrily'', however, was a 16-performance flop. "''Merrily'' did not succeed, but its score endures thanks to subsequent productions and recordings. According to [[Martin Gottfried]], "Sondheim had set out to write traditional songs<U+2026> But [despite] that there is nothing ordinary about the music."<ref>Gottfried, Martin (photos By Martha Swope), ''Sondheim'', New York: Harry N. Abrams, Inc., 1993, pgs. 146-147 ISBN 978-0-8109-3844-1 ISBN 0-8109-3844-8</ref> Sondheim and Furth have extensively revised the show since its initial opening.

=== Collaborations with James Lapine (1984<U+2013>1994) ===

The failure of ''Merrily'' greatly affected Sondheim; he was ready to quit theatre and do movies or create [[video game]]s or write mysteries.  He was later quoted as saying, "I wanted to find something to satisfy myself that does not involve Broadway and dealing with all those people who hate me and hate Hal."<ref>in Gottfried, ''Sondheim'', p.153</ref>  The collaboration between Sondheim and Prince would largely end after ''Merrily'' - until the 2003 production of ''Bounce'', another failure.

However, instead of quitting the theatre following the failure of ''Merrily'', Sondheim decided "that there are better places to start a show", and found a new collaborator in the "artsy" [[James Lapine]]. Lapine has a taste "for the [[avant-garde]] and for visually oriented theatre in particular." Their first collaboration was ''[[Sunday in the Park with George]]'' (1984), in which Sondheim's music evoked the [[pointillism|pointillist]] painting technique of its subject, [[Georges-Pierre Seurat|Georges Seurat]]. In 1985, he and Lapine won the [[Pulitzer Prize for Drama]] for ''Sunday in the Park with George''. It is one of only nine musicals to receive this prestigious award. The show had its first revival on Broadway in 2008.  

The Sondheim-Lapine collaboration also produced the [[Fairy tale|fairy-tale]] show ''[[Into the Woods]]'' (1987) and the rhapsodic ''[[Passion (musical)|Passion]]'' (1994). 1990 saw the opening of Sondheim's  ''[[Assassins (musical)|Assassins]]'' off-Broadway.

=== Later work ===

In the late nineties, Sondheim reunited with Hal Prince for ''Wise Guys'', a long-in-the-works musical comedy about brothers [[Addison Mizner|Addison]] and [[Wilson Mizner]].  Though a Broadway production starring [[Nathan Lane]] and [[Victor Garber]] and directed by [[Sam Mendes]] was announced for Spring 2000,<ref>{{cite news|last = Bahr|first = David|url = http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1589/is_1999_Oct_12/ai_55983616
|title = Everything's coming up Sondheim|publisher = The Advocate|date = 1999-10-12|accessdate = 2007-03-19
}}</ref> the New York debut of the musical was delayed.  Rechristened ''[[Road Show (musical)|Bounce]]'' in 2003, the show was mounted at the [[Goodman Theatre]] in [[Chicago]], and at the [[John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts|Kennedy Center]] in [[Washington, D.C.]].  ''Bounce'' received disappointing reviews and never reached Broadway.  A revised version of ''Bounce'' premiered off-Broadway at [[The Public Theater]] under the new name ''Road Show'' from October 28, 2008 through December 28, 2008, under the direction of [[John Doyle (director)|John Doyle]]. 

Regarding his interest in writing new work, Sondheim was quoted in a 2006 ''Time Out: London'' interview as saying, "No... It's age. It's a diminution of energy and the worry that there are no new ideas. It<U+2019>s also an increasing lack of confidence. I<U+2019>m not the only one. I<U+2019>ve checked with other people. People expect more of you and you<U+2019>re aware of it and you shouldn<U+2019>t be."<ref>[http://www.timeout.com/london/theatre/features/303.html 2006 Sondheim feature]. Timeout.com London</ref>  In December 2007, however, Sondheim said that, along with continued work on ''Bounce'', he was "nibbling at a couple of things with [[John Weidman]] and [[James Lapine]]."<ref>[http://darkhorizons.com/news07/sondheim.php 2007 Interview: Stephen Sondheim for "Sweeney Todd"]. DarkHorizons.com</ref>

Lapine created a "multimedia revue", formerly titled ''Sondheim: a Musical Revue'', which had been scheduled to premiere in April  2009 at the [[Alliance Theatre]], [[Atlanta]], Georgia. However that production was canceled, due to "difficulties encountered by the commercial producers attached to the project...in raising the necessary funds".<ref>Hetrick, Adam.

=== Work away from Broadway ===
Sondheim's career has been varied, encompassing much beyond the composition of musicals.   

An avid fan of games, in 1968 and 1969 Sondheim published a series of [[Cryptic crossword|cryptic crossword puzzles]] in [[New York (magazine)|''New York'' magazine]].  In 1987, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' referred to his love of puzzlemaking as "legendary in theater circles," adding that the [[Fictional character|central character]] in [[Anthony Shaffer]]'s hit play ''[[Sleuth (play)|Sleuth]]'' was inspired by Sondheim.  (There was a rumor that ''Sleuth'' was given the working title ''Who's Afraid of Stephen Sondheim?'', but in a ''New York Times'' interview on March 10, 1996, Shaffer denied ever using the title.)<ref name= "master"/>  Sondheim's love of puzzles and mysteries can also be seen in the intricate "whodunit" he co-wrote with longtime friend [[Anthony Perkins]], ''[[The Last of Sheila]]''.  This 1973 film, directed by [[Herbert Ross]], starred [[Dyan Cannon]], [[Raquel Welch]], [[James Mason]], [[James Coburn]] and [[Richard Benjamin]].

He tried his hand at playwriting one more time - in 1996 he collaborated with ''[[Company (musical)|Company]]'' librettist [[George Furth]] on a play called ''Getting Away with Murder''.  It was not a success, and the Broadway production closed after 29 previews and 17 performances.

His compositional efforts have included a number of film scores, notably a set of songs written for [[Warren Beatty]]'s 1990 film version of ''[[Dick Tracy (1990 film)|Dick Tracy]]''; one song, "[[Sooner or Later (Madonna song)|Sooner or Later (I Always Get My Man)]]" (as performed by [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]), won Sondheim an [[Academy Award]].

===Unfinished/Canceled Works===
Sondheim was asked to translate [[Mahagonny-Songspiel]] with [[W.H. Auden]], but declined.  He said, "But, I'm not a Brecht/Weill fan and that's really all there is to it. I'm an apostate: I like Weill's music when he came to America better than I do his stuff before.... I love The Threepenny Opera but, outside of The Threepenny Opera, the music of his I like is the stuff he wrote in America - when he was not writing with Brecht, when he was writing for Broadway."<ref name=bww>Cerasaro, Pat.[http://broadwayworld.com/article/BWW_EXCLUSIVE_Stephen_Sondheim_Talks_Past_Present_Future_20101103 "Stephen Sondheim Talks Past Present Future"] broadwayworld.com, November 3, 2010</ref>

Sondheim worked with [[William Goldman]] on ''Singing Out Loud'', a movie musical.  Sondheim states that Goldman wrote 1-2 drafts of the script and Sondheim wrote six and a half songs, only to have director [[Rob Reiner]] lose interest in the project. The songs ''Dawn'' and ''Sand'' from the project were recorded for the albums ''Sondheim at the Movies'' and ''Unsung Sondheim''.<ref name=bww/> 

Sondheim and [[Leonard Bernstein]] wrote ''[[The Race to Urga]]'', scheduled to play at the Lincoln Center in 1969, but when [[Jerome Robbins]] left the project, it went unproduced.<ref>Long, Robert.

Sondheim also wrote some new songs for a proposed [[Into the Woods]] [[Into the Woods#Film|film]], including one song entitled ''Rainbows'', which Sondheim claims will be in his second book. The project never got further than a readthrough.<ref name=bww/>

=== Book ===
He wrote a book of annotations of his lyrics, with the first volume titled ''Finishing the Hat'' (2010). According to ''Playbill'', it is a collection of his lyrics "from productions dating 1954-1981. In addition to published and unpublished lyrics from ''West Side Story'', ''Follies'' and ''Company'', the tome finds Sondheim discussing his relationship with Oscar Hammerstein II and his collaborations with composers, actors and directors throughout his lengthy career."<ref>Hetrick, Adam.[http://www.playbill.com/news/article/142096-Stephen-Sondheim-and-James-Earl-Jones-Set-for-TimesTalks-This-Fall "Stephen Sondheim and James Earl Jones Set for TimesTalks This Fall"] playbill.com, August 16, 2010</ref><ref>[http://www.randomhouse.com/catalog/display.pperl/display.pperl?isbn=9780679439073&view=toc  Table of Contents] randomhouse.com</ref> Sondheim said "It's going to be long.

== Personal life ==
In ''[[The Times]]'' in 2009, Alan Franks wrote: "Sondheim came out as gay only when he was about 40, and did not live with a partner until he was 61.  This was Peter Jones, a dramatist; the two lived together for several years, until 1999."<ref>Franks, Alan. [http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/stage/theatre/article6160266.ece  "Stephen Sondheim: 'My ideal collaborator is me'"]. Times Online, April 25, 2009</ref>  Sondheim discussed relationships in an interview with Frank Rich, who wrote, "His long solitary spell, he says, didn't faze him....  Well, in his case, does being gay play a part in it?  'Homosexuality, certainly it's a part of it. But the outsider feeling <U+2013> somebody who people want to both kiss and kill <U+2013> occurred quite early in my life.'"<ref name="rich"/> Sondheim's social life in the NYC gay scene is also discussed in many books by [[Alan Helms]].
