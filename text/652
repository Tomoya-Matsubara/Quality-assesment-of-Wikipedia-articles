'''Old Prescott Road''' is a road in [[Greely]] community in [[Ottawa]], [[Canada]], that goes from [[Mitch Owens Road (Ottawa)|Mitch Owens Road]] all the way to [[Stagecoach Road (Ottawa)|Stagecoach Road]]. It's only two lane, and the speed limit is 60 km/h in the built up area from Mitch Owens until past [[Shadow Ridge Estates]].

During the late 1990's prior to amalgamation, a teacher at [[Greely Elementary School]] was killed in a motor-vehicle accident at the intersection of Old Prescott Road and Parkway Road. The [[Regional Municipality of Ottawa-Carleton]] did a study of the intersection following an outcry by the community demanding a four way light, but the [[Osgoode Township]] Council only approved a four-way [[stop sign]]. A year later, it was replaced with a four way [[traffic light]] due to the noise of trucks stopping at the stop signs.
