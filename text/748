'''Solanine''' is a [[glycoalkaloid]] [[poison]] found in species of the [[Solanaceae|nightshade family]], such as potatoes. It can occur naturally in any part of the plant, including the leaves, fruit, and tubers. It is very toxic even in small quantities. Solanine has both fungicidal and pesticidal properties, and it is one of the plant's natural defenses. Solanine was first isolated in [[1820]] by Desfosses from the berries of the [[Solanum nigrum|European Black Nightshade]], ''Solanum nigrum'', after which it was named.<ref>Desfosses, M. (1820): ''Extrait d'une lettre <U+00E0> M. Robiquet.'' In:  ''J. de Pharmacie.'' Bd. 6, S. 374<U+2013>376.</ref>

== Solanine poisoning ==
=== Symptoms ===

Solanine poisoning is primarily displayed by gastrointestinal and neurological disorders. Symptoms include nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, stomach cramps, burning of the throat, heart arrhythmia, headache and dizziness. Hallucinations, loss of sensation, paralysis, fever, [[jaundice]], dilated pupils and [[hypothermia]] have been reported in more severe cases.

In large quantities, solanine poisoning can cause death. One study suggests that doses of 2 to 5&nbsp;mg per kilogram of body weight can cause toxic symptoms, and doses of 3 to 6&nbsp;mg per kilogram of body weight can be fatal.

Symptoms usually occur 8 to 12 hours after ingestion, but may occur as rapidly as 30 minutes after eating high-solanine foods.

The lowest dose to cause symptoms of nausea is about 25&nbsp;mg solanine for adults, a life-threatening dose for a regular-weight adult ranges about 400&nbsp;mg solanine. {{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

=== Mechanism of Action ===

One study suggests that the toxic mechanism of solanine is caused by the chemical's interaction with mitochondrial membranes. Experiments show that solanine exposure opens the potassium channels of [[mitochondria]], increasing their membrane potential. This in turn leads to Ca2+ being transported down its concentration gradient into the mitochondria, and it is this increased concentration of Ca2+ in the cell that triggers cell damage and [[apoptosis]].<ref name="pmid16733852">{{cite journal

=== Correlation with birth defects ===

Some studies show a correlation between the consumption of potatoes suffering from late-blight (which increases solanine and other glycoalkaloid levels) and the incidence of congenital [[spina bifida]] in humans. However, other studies have shown no correlation between potato consumption and the incidence of birth defects.<ref name="v30je19">{{cite url |url=http://www.inchem.org/documents/jecfa/jecmono/v30je19.htm |title=SOLANINE AND CHACONINE

== Solanine in potatoes ==

Solanine occurs naturally in many species of the genus [[Solanum]], including [[potatoes]] (''Solanum tuberosum''), [[tomato]]es (''Solanum lycopersicum''), [[eggplant]] (''Solanum melongena''), and bittersweet nightshade (''[[Solanum dulcamara]]'').

Potatoes naturally produce solanine and [[chaconine]], a related glycoalkaloid, as a defense mechanism against insects, disease, and predators. Potato leaves, stems and shoots are naturally high in glycoalkaloids.

When potato [[tuber]]s are exposed to light, they turn green and increase glycoalkaloid production. This is a natural defense to help prevent the uncovered tuber from being eaten. The green colour is from [[chlorophyll]], and is itself harmless. However, it is an indication that increased level of solanine and chaconine may be present.

Some diseases, such as [[potato blight]], can dramatically increase the levels of glycoalkaloids present in potatoes. Mechanically damaged potatoes also produce increased levels of glycoalkaloids. This is believed to be a natural reaction of the plant in response to disease and damage.

Commercial varieties of potatoes are screened for solanine levels<sup>''[in which countries?]''</sup>, and most have a solanine content of less than 0.2&nbsp;mg/g. However, potatoes that have been exposed to light and started to green can show concentrations of 1&nbsp;mg/g or more. In these situations a single unpeeled potato can result in a dangerous dose.

In potato tubers 30<U+2013>80% of the solanine develops in and close to the skin.

Showing green under the skin strongly suggests solanine build-up in potatoes although each process can occur without the other. A bitter taste in a potato is another, potentially more reliable indicator of toxicity.  Because of the bitter taste and appearance of such potatoes, solanine poisoning is rare outside conditions of food shortage.  The symptoms are mainly [[vomiting]] and [[diarrhea]], and the condition may be misdiagnosed as [[gastroenteritis]].  Most potato poisoning victims recover fully, although fatalities are known especially when victims are undernourished or do not receive suitable treatment.<ref>{{cite journal | title = Solanine poisoning | journal = Br Med J. | date = 1979-12-08 | volume =  2 | issue = 6203 | pages = 1458<U+2013>1459 | pmc = 1597169}}</ref>  Fatalities are also known from solanine poisoning from other plants in the nightshade family, such as the berries of ''[[Solanum dulcamara]]'' (woody nightshade).<ref>{{cite journal | title = A Fatal Case of Solanine Poisoning | author = R. F. Alexander, G. B. Forbes, and E. S. Hawkins | journal = Br Med J. | date = 1948-09-11 | volume = 2 | issue = 4575 | pages = 518 | pmc = 2091497}}</ref>

The National Institute of Health's information on solanine says to never eat potatoes that are green below the skin.

Deep-frying potatoes at 170<U+00B0>C (306<U+00B0>F) is known to effectively lower glycoalkaloid levels (because they move into the frying fat), whereas microwaving is only somewhat effective, freeze drying or dehydration has little effect and boiling has no effect<ref>{{cite web | title = Review of Toxicological Literature prepared for Errol Zeiger, Ph.D, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, Submitted by Raymond Tice | month = February | year = 1998 | url = http://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/go/15334 | work = Testing Status of Agents at NTP (National Toxicology Program)}}</ref>.

== Solanine in green tomatoes ==

While [[Ripening|ripe]] (red or yellow) [[tomato]]es do not contain significant amounts of solanine, the amount of solanine in unripe (green) tomatoes is quite high. A dose of 25&nbsp;mg is about the dose where symptoms of [[nausea]] start to show.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} Depending on the variety of tomatoes the amount of 25&nbsp;mg solanine may be reached with less than 80 g of raw green tomatoes, and the potentially life-threating dose for adults of 400&nbsp;mg may be reached between 1.25&nbsp;kg to 4.5&nbsp;kg of raw green tomatoes.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} As with potatoes, deep-frying them does reduce the solanine level significantly (up to 50%) while solanine dissolves into the frying fat. Therefore only small portions of no more than 80 g of raw green tomatoes or 150 g of deep-fried green tomatoes should be consumed per day by adults.

== Other uses of solanine ==

Solanine has [[fungicide|fungicidal]] and [[pesticide|pesticidal]] properties, and solanine hydrochloride (a salt of solanine) has been used as a commercial pesticide, but never on a large scale.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

Solanine has [[sedative]] and [[anticonvulsant]] properties, and has been used as a treatment for [[asthma]], as well as for [[cough]] and [[Common cold|cold]] medicines. However, its effectiveness for either use is questionable.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}
