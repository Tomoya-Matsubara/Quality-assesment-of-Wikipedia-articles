In [[rodent]]s, '''sphenopalatine vacuities''' are perforations of the roof of the [[mesopterygoid fossa]], the open space behind the [[palate]], in between the [[parapterygoid fossa]]e.<ref>Weksler, 2006, p.&nbsp;37, fig.&nbsp;20</ref> They may perforate the [[presphenoid]] or [[basisphenoid bone]].<ref name=W37/> Their development and form are variable between and within species, and features of the sphenopalatine vacuities have been used as characters in [[cladistics|cladistic]] analyses.<ref>Weksler, 2006, p.&nbsp;37; Steppan, 1995, pp.&nbsp;37<U+2013>38; Carleton, 1980, p.&nbsp;44</ref>

Among [[Oryzomyini]], a mainly South American group, a 2006 study distinguished three character states<U+2014>large, wide vacuities, as among others in ''[[Oligoryzomys]]'' and ''[[Holochilus]]''; small, narrow vacuities, as among others in ''[[Lundomys]]'' and ''[[Nephelomys]]''; and no or vestigial vacuities, as among others in ''[[Mindomys]]'' and ''[[Oryzomys]]''.<ref name=W37>Weksler, 2006, p.&nbsp;37</ref> [[Phyllotini]] all have very large sphenopalatine vacuities, as does ''Sigmodon''. The vacuities in ''[[Reithrodon]]'', formerly considered a phyllotine, are especially large.<ref name=S38>Steppan, 1995, p.&nbsp;38</ref> ''[[Nyctomys]]'' is special in having sphenopalatine vacuities restricted to the basisphenoid bone.<ref name=W37/> [[Character polarity]] for the development of the vacuities in [[Cricetidae]] is difficult to determine, but their absence may be primitive in the [[Neotominae]].<ref name=S38/>

The development of sphenopalatine vacuities has also been used to distinguish among members of the [[Sciurini]] group of [[squirrel]]s.<ref name=M179>Moore, 1959, p.&nbsp;179</ref>
