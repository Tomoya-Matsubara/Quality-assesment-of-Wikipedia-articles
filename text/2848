'''Lara Croft''' is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]] and the [[protagonist]] of [[Square Enix]]'s (previously [[Eidos Interactive]]) ''[[Tomb Raider]]'' video game series. She is presented as a beautiful, intelligent, and athletic [[Archaeology|archaeologist]]-adventurer who ventures into ancient, hazardous tombs and ruins around the world. Created by [[Toby Gard]] during his employment at British developer [[Core Design]], the character first appeared in the 1996 video game ''[[Tomb Raider (video game)|Tomb Raider]]''. Other appearances include video game sequels, printed adaptations, a series of animated short films, [[feature film]]s (portrayed by [[Angelina Jolie]]), and various merchandise related to the series. Lara Croft has also been licensed for third-party promotion, including television and print advertisements, music-related appearances, and as a spokesmodel. Promotion of the character includes a brand of apparel and accessories, action figures, and [[Model (person)|model]] portrayals.

Core Design first handled development of the character and the series. Inspired by pop artist [[Neneh Cherry]] and comic book character [[Tank Girl]], Gard designed Lara Croft to counter stereotypical female characters. The company modified the character for subsequent titles; modifications included graphical improvements and gameplay additions such as new manoeuvres and in-game items. Poor reception for the 2003 sequel ''[[Tomb Raider: The Angel of Darkness]]'' resulted in a switch to American developer [[Crystal Dynamics]]. The new developer rebooted the character along with the video game series. Crystal Dynamics focused on making the character more believable, and altered her capabilities to interact with game environments as well as her proportions. Lara Croft has been voiced by four actresses throughout the video game series: Shelley Blond, Judith Gibbins, Jonell Elliott, and Keeley Hawes.

Critics consider Lara Croft a significant game character in popular culture. She hold two [[Guinness World Records]] and has a strong fan following. The character's debut was well-received by the video game industry, but slowly declined until the series' reboot in 2006, which was met with mixed responses. Lara Croft is also considered a sex symbol, one of the earliest in the industry to achieve wide-spread attention. The character's influence in the industry has been a point of contention among critics.

== Description ==
Lara Croft is depicted as an athletic woman; she has brown eyes and hair, frequently kept in a [[Braid|plait]] or [[ponytail]]. The character's classic costume is a turquoise sleeveless [[Bodysuit]], light brown shorts, calf-high boots, and long white socks. Accessories include fingerless gloves, a backpack, a utility belt with holsters on either side, and two pistols. The video game sequels introduced new outfits designed for different environments, such as underwater and cold weather. Lara Croft wears a crop top in later games, and variations on this theme, such as [[camouflage]] pants and black or light brown shirts.<ref name="IGN-ManyLooks">{{cite web| url = http://stars.ign.com/articles/930/930908p1.html| title = The Many Looks of Lara Croft: Videogames| publisher = IGN| date = 2008-11-17| first = Jesse| last = Schedeen| accessdate = 2010-06-17}}</ref><ref name="PCGamer-166">{{cite journal| journal = [[PC Gamer]]| publisher = [[Future plc|Future US]]| author = PC Gamer Staff| title = She's Had Work Done| page = 53| issue = 166| month = October| year = 2007}}</ref><ref name="CVG-2008">{{cite journal| journal = [[Computer and Video Games]] Presents| publisher = [[Future plc|Future Publishing]]| title = Is Tomb Raider in Deep Water?| pages = 20<U+2013>29| author = CVG Staff| year = 2008| issue = 3}}</ref> The character's backstory is described in game manuals as an [[English people|English]] woman born in [[Wimbledon, London]] who is the daughter of the fictional Lord Henshingly Croft.

Lara Croft has been portrayed in two [[feature film]]s by Academy Award-winning actress [[Angelina Jolie]]. The films depicted Lara Croft's backstory differently from games prior to ''Legend''.

=== Switch to Crystal Dynamics ===

''Angel of Darkness'' was received poorly, prompting Eidos<U+2014>fearing financial troubles from another unsuccessful game<U+2014>to give development duties for future titles to [[Crystal Dynamics]].<ref name="OPM-93"/><ref name="PSM-77">{{cite journal| journal = [[PlayStation: The Official Magazine|PlayStation Magazine]]| publisher = [[Future plc|US Imagine Publishing]]| author = PlayStation Magazine Staff| title = The Next Tomb Raider| pages = 57<U+2013>60| issue = 77| month = November| year = 2003}}</ref> The ''[[Legacy of Kain]]'' development team began work on a new title (''Tomb Raider: Legend''), and Toby Gard returned to work as a consultant.<ref name="IGNhistory"/><ref name="GI-146">{{cite journal| journal = [[Game Informer]]| publisher = [[GameStop]]| author = Game Informer Staff| title = Lara Croft Tomb Raider: Legend Preview| pages = 80<U+2013>81| issue = 146| month = June| year = 2005}}</ref> The development team reassessed the brand value of the franchise and its protagonist. Chip Blundell, Eidos's vice-president of brand management, commented that the designers understood that fans saw the character and brand as their own, rather than Eidos's.<ref name="OPM-93"/> With that in mind, the team retooled the franchise and character to emphasize aspects of the original game that made them unique.<ref name="OPM-93"/><ref name="GI-148">{{cite journal| journal = [[Game Informer]]| publisher = [[GameStop]]| author = Game Informer Staff| title = Tomb Raider Legend Preview| page = 87| issue = 148| month = August| year = 2005}}</ref> The storyline intended for a trilogy of games that started with ''Angel of Darkness'' was abandoned and a new plot was created for ''Legend''.<ref name="OPM-93"/>

Crystal Dynamics focused on believability rather than realism to re-develop the character, posing decisions around the question, "What could Lara do?", and giving her action more freedom.<ref name="PTOM-11">{{cite journal| journal = [[PlayStation: The Official Magazine]]| publisher = [[Future plc|Future Publishing]]| month = October| year = 2008| issue = 11| title = Tomb Raider: Underworld Preview| page = 48| first = Gary| last = Steinman}}</ref> They updated Lara Croft's move set to make her movements appear more fluid and continuous. The animations were also updated so the character could better interact with environmental objects.<ref name="GI-146"/> The developers introduced a feature that causes the character's skin and clothing appear wet after swimming and dirty after rolling on the ground.<ref name="GI-146"/><ref name="PSM-105">{{cite journal| journal = [[PlayStation: The Official Magazine|PlayStation Magazine]]| publisher = [[Future plc|US Imagine Publishing]]| first = Kaiser| last = Hwang| title = Tomb Raider: Legend Preview| pages = 44<U+2013>45| issue = 105| month = Winter Holiday| year = 2005}}</ref> Responding to criticism directed at the character controls in ''Angel of Darkness'', Crystal Dynamics redesigned the character's control scheme to provide the best third-person action experience.<ref name="OPM-93"/> The developers also introduced close-quarter melee manoeuvres.<ref name="PTOM-3">{{cite journal| journal = [[PlayStation: The Official Magazine]]| publisher = [[Future plc|Future Publishing]]| month = January| year = 2008| issue = 3| title = Tomb Raider 8 Preview| pages = 20<U+2013>22| first = Randy| last = Nelson}}</ref> Crystal Dynamics updated the character model to add more realism, but retained its caricatured design.<ref name="GI-146"/><ref name="PSM-105"/> The polygon count was increased to over 9800, and more attention was paid to the character's lip syncing and facial expressions to allow for dynamic emotional responses to in-game events.<ref name="GI-146"/> In redesigning the character's appearance, Crystal Dynamics updated Lara Croft's hairstyle, wardrobe, and accessories. Her shirt was changed to a V-neck shirt, and her body was given more muscle tone; her hair braid was also switched to a pony tail.<ref name="PCGamer-166"/><ref name="CVG-2008"/><ref name="OPM-93"/> [[Rachel Weisz]] was rumoured to provide voice work for the character; however, [[Keeley Hawes]] became the new voice actor.<ref name="IGNhistory"/><ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3147003| title = Rachel Weisz to Voice Lara Croft?| first = Scott| last = Sharkey| publisher = 1UP.com| date = 2006-01-12| accessdate = 2010-03-09}}</ref><ref name="Edge-Hawes">{{cite web| url = http://www.edge-online.com/news/news-snips-0224| title = News Snips 02/24| author = Edge Staff| publisher = ''[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]''| date = 2006-02-23| accessdate = 2010-03-09}}</ref>

Crystal Dynamics carried over the changes made in ''Legend'' to ''Tomb Raider: Anniversary'', a remake of the first game; the firm made a few minor alterations (such as character model details).<ref name="IGNhistory"/><ref name="GI-165-Preview">{{cite journal| journal = [[Game Informer]]| publisher = [[GameStop]]| author = Game Informer Staff| title = Tomb Raider Anniversary Preview| pages = 72<U+2013>73| issue = 165| month = January| year = 2007}}</ref> In remaking the original, the designers aimed to portray more emotional depth. Crystal Dynamics focused on the character's desire to achieve the end goal of the game, culminating in killing one of the antagonists. Staff used the death to portray guilt in Lara Croft afterward and illustrate that shooting a person should be a difficult choice.<ref>{{cite video game| title = Tomb Raider: Anniversary| developer = Crystal Dynamics| publisher = Eidos Interactive| date = 2007| level = Natla's Mine commentary| quote = }}</ref>

''Tomb Raider: Underworld'' continued the plot line established in ''Legend''.<ref name="CVG-2008"/> Crystal Dynamics used new technology to improve the character for [[History of video game consoles (seventh generation)|seventh generation consoles]], focusing on improving realism. The dirt accumulation and water cleansing mechanic from ''Legend'' was altered to be a [[Real-time computer graphics|real-time]] mechanic that can involve the entire game environment.<ref name="CVG-2008"/><ref name="Play-GoG5-5">{{cite journal| journal = [[Play (US magazine)|Play Magazine Presents Girls of Gaming]]| title = The Evolution of an Icon| issue = 5.5| publisher = Fusion Publishing, Inc.| author = Play Magazine Staff| page = | year = 2008}}</ref><ref name="GI-183">{{cite journal| journal = [[Game Informer]]| publisher = [[GameStop]]| author = Game Informer Staff| title = Tomb Raider: Underworld Preview| pages = 74<U+2013>75| issue = 183| month = July| year = 2008}}</ref> To achieve a more natural appearance, the developers added [[spherical harmonics]] to provide indirect lighting to in-game objects like Lara Croft.<ref name="GI-183"/> The character model was made more complex and detailed than previous instalments, featuring more texture layers that determine the appearance of shadows and reflective light on it, and using [[skeletal animation]] to portray believable movement. The developers enhanced Lara Croft's facial model by increasing the number of polygons, bones used in the animation skeleton, and graphical shaders in the face to add more detail and expressive capabilities. The hair was created as a real-time cloth [[Computer simulation|simulation]] to further add realism to its shape and movement. The developers kept Lara Croft's hair tied back because they felt a real person would not want it flying around while performing dangerous manoeuvres.<ref name="Play-GoG5-5"/> The character's body shape size was increased and breast size reduced to portray more realistic proportions.<ref name="CVG-2008"/>

The developers tried to redefine Lara Croft's actions by questioning what they felt the character was capable of.<ref name="GI-178">{{cite journal| journal = [[Game Informer]]| publisher = [[GameStop]]| author = Game Informer Staff| title = Tomb Raider: Underworld Preview| pages = 66<U+2013>67| issue = 178| month = February| year = 2008}}</ref> While previous games used hand-animated movement for the character, ''Underworld'' introduced [[motion capture]]d-based animation to portray more fluid, realistic movement and facial expressions.<ref name="CVG-2008"/><ref name="GI-183"/><ref name="PTOM-9">{{cite journal| journal = [[PlayStation: The Official Magazine]]| publisher = [[Future plc|Future Publishing]]| month = August| year = 2008| issue = 9| title = Tomb Raider: Underworld Preview| page = 48| first = Rob| last = Smith}}</ref> Stuntwoman and Olympic Gold medalist Heidi Moneymaker was the motion capture actor, and advised the designers on practical movements.<ref name="CVG-2008"/> Animators adjusted and blended the recorded animation to create seamless transitions between the separate moves and their simultaneous combinations.<ref name="GI-178"/><ref name="Edge-196">{{cite journal| journal = [[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]| publisher = [[Future plc|Future Publishing]]| title = Tomb Raider: Underworld| page = 95| author = Edge Staff| date = [[Christmas and holiday season|Christmas]] 2008| issue = 196}}</ref> The blends and additional animations give the character more flexible movement.<ref name="Play-GoG5-5"/> Actions were overlapped to allow for multitasking, such as aiming at two separate targets and shooting with one hand while the other holds an object collected from the environment.<ref name="PTOM-3"/><ref name="GI-178"/> Other additions include more melee attacks, as well as contextual offensive and climbing manoeuvres.<ref name="GI-178"/><ref name="Edge-186">{{cite journal| journal = [[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]| title = Tomb Raider: Underworld| pages = 34<U+2013>35| publisher = [[Future plc|Future Publishing]]| author = Edge Staff| date = March 2008| issue = 186}}</ref> Crystal Dynamics sought to make the visual appearance of the [[Xbox 360]] and [[PlayStation 3]] versions identical, although the systems use different techniques to achieve this.<ref name="Play-GoG5-5"/> In response to ''Underworld''{{'}}s lackluster sales figures, Eidos reportedly considered altering the character's appearance to appeal more to female fans.<ref name="GI-191">{{cite journal| journal = [[Game Informer]]| publisher = [[GameStop]]| author = Game Informer Staff| title = Connect: Lara Croft's Makeover| page = 28| issue = 191| month = March| year = 2009}}</ref>

However, interaction with the press, especially those in Europe, resulted in less clothing depicted in promotional images.<ref name="Arcade-1"/> Concerned with diluting Lara Croft's personality, Eidos avoided products it felt did not fit the character.<ref name="VirtSed-Spirits"/> Ian Livingstone, Eidos's product acquisition director, commented that the company declines most merchandising proposals.

Bands and artists including [[Depeche Mode]], [[Moby]], [[Faith No More]], [[Jimi Tenor]], and [[Apollo 440]] donated their songs for the album.<ref name="VirtSed-Stage"/> In conjunction with the release of the 2001 film adaptation, Eidos licensed Lara Croft free-of-charge to the Gordonstoun boarding school for a commercial. The school approached Eidos about use of the character. Eidos allowed the one-time licence due to Core Design's inclusion of Gordonstoun in Lara Croft's fictional biography without the school's permission.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/1418106.stm| title = Lara's school days on big screen| publisher = BBC News| author = BBC Staff| date = 2001-07-02| accessdate = 2010-05-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/lara-croft-offers-gordonstoun-a-lift-676318.html| title = Lara Croft offers Gordonstoun a lift| first = Andrew| last = Hibbard| publisher = [[The Independent]]| date = 2001-07-02| accessdate = 2010-05-18}}</ref> Near the end of 2006, Lara Croft became the spokesmodel for the Skin Cancer Awareness Foundation of [[Minden, Nevada]] as part of their Sun Smart Teen Program.

Reaction from groups have been mixed.

Author Mark Cohen attributed Lara Croft's eroticism among male fans to the character's appearance and a male protective instinct. German psychologist Oscar Holzberg described the protective behaviour as the result of the opportunity to act as a hero in virtual worlds and a fear of powerful, emancipated women.<ref name="VirtSed-Toy">{{cite book| title = Lara Croft: The Art of Virtual Seduction| first = Mark| last = Cohen| publisher = [[Crown Publishing Group|Prima Publishing]]| isbn = 7615-2696-X| chapter = The Desire of the Toy| pages = 106<U+2013>109}}</ref> Jonathan Smith of ''Arcade: The Videogame Magazine'' similarly noted that male players often see themselves as "chivalrous protectors" while playing the game.<ref name="Arcade-1"/> Holzberg further stated that the lower psychological investment inherent to virtual characters is more comfortable for males. Cohen affirmed that despite blatant male appeal, Croft garnered a serious female audience. Eidos estimated by 2000, female consumers comprised 20<U+2013>25&nbsp;percent of ''Tomb Raider'' game purchases.<ref name="VirtSed-Toy"/> Jeremy Smith argued that ''Tomb Raider'' attracted more female players to video gaming, especially in Japan. Smith believed that Croft does not alienate prospective female players, representing an emancipated heroine and not simply an attractive character.<ref name="PSM-4-Feature"/><ref name="VirtSed-Toy"/> According to Adrian Smith, the character was also popular with younger demographics that did not view her sexually.<ref name="TIME-Behind"/> Cohen reasoned that Lara Croft differs from other erotic characters and attractive leads, as the ''Tomb Raider'' game series also featured rich action, impressive graphics, and intelligent puzzles; other such characters were unsuccessful because the game content was lacking.<ref name="VirtSed-Toy"/> [[Amy Hennig]] of developer [[Naughty Dog]] and Griffiths echoed similar statements.<ref name="Arcade-1"/><ref name="1UP-GettingGirl"/> [[GamesRadar]] editor Justin Toweel nonetheless commented that he couldn't imagine a ''Tomb Raider'' game without a sexualized female lead.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.gamesradar.com/f/sexualisation-of-games-characters/a-20100308113512723069| title =  Sexualisation of games characters| first = Justin| last = Towell| publisher = GamesRadar| date = 2010-03-08| accessdate = 2010-03-09}}</ref>

Griffith described Lara Croft as a flawed female influence. He stated that though the character is a step in the right direction, too many women view her as a "crudely realised male fantasy figure".<ref name="Arcade-1"/> Women in the video game industry describe the character as both a positive and negative influence. Ismini Roby of WomenGamers.com commented that Lara Croft was not a sexist influence in 1996, attributed to the lack of prominent female characters in video games at the time. She stated that the over-sexualized appearance was overlooked because the character was a "breath of fresh air". However, Roby felt that though Lara Croft's proportions have become more realistic, the character's personality was diluted by the developer's actions to appeal to a male audience. LesbianGamers.com's Tracy Whitelaw called the character a dichotomy, stating that though Lara Croft is viewed as "idealized" with an "unattainable body", the character was a great stride for the propagation of female characters as video game protagonists.<ref name="Edge-Sexist">{{cite web| url = http://www.edge-online.com/features/is-lara-croft-sexist| title = Is Lara Croft Sexist?| first = Kris| last = Graft| date = 2008-09-01| publisher = [[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]| accessdate = 2010-05-27}}</ref>
