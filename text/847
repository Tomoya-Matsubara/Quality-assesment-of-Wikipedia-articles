'''Hurricane Floyd''' was the sixth named storm, fourth [[hurricane]], and third major hurricane in the [[1999 Atlantic hurricane season]]. Floyd triggered the second largest evacuation in US history (behind Hurricane Rita) when 2.6 million coastal residents of five states including Florida were ordered from their homes as Hurricane Floyd approached. The [[Cape Verde-type hurricane]] formed off the coast of Africa and lasted from [[September 7]] to [[September 19]], peaking in strength as a very strong Category 4 hurricane &mdash; just short of the highest possible rating &mdash; on the [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale]]. It was among the largest [[Atlantic hurricane]]s of its strength ever recorded.

Floyd struck [[The Bahamas]] at peak strength, causing heavy damage.  It then paralleled the [[East Coast of the United States]], causing massive evacuations and costly preparations. The storm weakened significantly, however, before making landfall in [[North Carolina]] as a Category 2 hurricane, and caused further damage as it traveled up the [[Mid-Atlantic States|Mid-Atlantic]] region and into [[New England]].

The hurricane produced torrential rainfall in eastern North Carolina, adding more rain to an area hit by [[Hurricane Dennis (1999)|Hurricane Dennis]] just weeks earlier. The rains caused widespread flooding over a period of several weeks; nearly every river basin in the eastern part of the state exceeded 500-year flood levels. In total, Floyd was responsible for 57 fatalities and $4.5 billion ($5.7 billion in 2006 [[United States dollar|U.S. dollars]]) in damage, mostly in North Carolina.

==Storm history==
{{storm path|Floyd 1999 track.png}}
Floyd originated as a [[tropical wave]] that exited the coast of [[Africa]] on [[September 2]]. It moved steadily westward and remained disorganized and devoid of deep convection until [[September 7]], when a curved band of deep convection developed over the center in response to a developing anticyclone. At this point, the [[National Hurricane Center]] designated it as Tropical Depression Eight, while it was approximately 1,000&nbsp;miles (1600&nbsp;km) east of the [[Lesser Antilles]]. A strong ridge of high pressure to its north forced the developing tropical cyclone westward over warmer waters, allowing it to strengthen to Tropical Storm Floyd on the 8th.<ref name="tcr">{{

Although a large storm, Floyd initially lacked a well-defined inner core, resulting in slow strengthening and preventing rapid intensification. On [[September 10]] it organized enough to reach hurricane status, and on the 11th Floyd approached major hurricane strength with winds of 110&nbsp;mph (175&nbsp;km/h) while north of the [[Leeward Islands]]. The central Atlantic upper tropospheric trough, along with an upper-level low in the eastern [[Caribbean Sea]], produced shear over the hurricane and caused its winds to weaken to 85&nbsp;mph (135&nbsp;km/h). A turn to the west, caused by building of high pressures, was followed by a period of rapid intensification: in 24 hours maximum sustained winds increased from 110&nbsp;mph (175&nbsp;km/h) to 155&nbsp;mph (250&nbsp;km/h), while the pressure dropped to 921&nbsp;[[mbar]] ([[hPa]]) by morning on the 13th.<ref name="hurdat_1999_6">{{cite web| author=NHC Hurricane Research Division| title=Atlantic hurricane best track ("HURDAT")| publisher=NOAA| accessdate=2006-02-17| url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/hurdat/easyhurdat_5104.html#1999_6 }}</ref> One contributor to the intensification was the high oceanic heat content along the storm's path.<ref name="tcr"/>

[[Image:Hurricane Floyd (1999).jpg|left|thumb|Hurricane Floyd at its North Carolina landfall]]

Hurricane Floyd remained just below Category 5 status on the [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale]] for 12 hours while crossing the Bahamas, making landfalls on [[Eleuthera]] and [[Abaco]] islands,<ref name="tcr"/> before an [[eye (cyclone)#Eyewall replacement cycle|eyewall replacement cycle]] weakened it to a Category 3 hurricane with winds of 120&nbsp;mph (195&nbsp;km/h). The new, larger eyewall contracted slightly, and the hurricane briefly re-intensified to Category 4 status. A strong mid- to upper-level trough eroded the western portion of the high-pressure ridge, steering Floyd to the northwest. It paralleled the eastern [[Florida]] coast 110&nbsp;miles (175&nbsp;km) off shore, and steadily weakened because of entrainment of dry air and upper-level shear.<ref name="tcr"/>  The storm remained extremely large, however; at its peak, tropical storm-force winds spanned a diameter of 580&nbsp;miles (935&nbsp;km), making Floyd one of the largest Atlantic hurricanes of its intensity ever recorded.<ref>{{

Floyd accelerated to the north and northeast, and weakened greatly to a Category 2 hurricane with 105&nbsp;mph (165&nbsp;km/h) winds at its [[Cape Fear]] landfall on [[September 16]]. After crossing over North Carolina and southeastern [[Virginia]], it briefly re-entered the western [[Atlantic Ocean]] before reaching [[Long Island]] on the 17th. The storm gradually lost its tropical characteristics due to an approaching frontal zone and became [[Extratropical cyclone|extratropical]] over southern [[Maine]] late on the 17th. The extratropical storm continued to the northeast, and after passing over the [[Canadian Maritimes]], it was absorbed by a cold front to the east of [[Newfoundland]].<ref name="tcr"/>
<div style="clear: both"></div>

==Preparations==

Although Floyd's track prediction was above average while out at sea, the forecasts as it approached the coastline were merely average compared to forecasts from the previous ten years. The official forecasts did not predict Floyd's northward track nor its significant weakening before landfall.<ref>{{

Initial fears were of a direct hit as a large Category 4 hurricane in Florida, potentially costlier and deadlier than [[Hurricane Andrew]] had been in 1992. In preparation for a potentially catastrophic landfall, more than one million Florida residents were told to evacuate, of which 272,000 were in [[Miami-Dade County, Florida|Miami-Dade County]].<ref>{{

A hurricane warning was issued for the North Carolina coastline 27 hours prior to landfall. However, due to the size of the storm, initial forecasts predicted nearly all of the state would be affected in one form or another.  School systems and businesses as far west as [[Asheville, North Carolina|Asheville]] shut down for the day landfall was predicted, but, as it turned out, only the [[Atlantic Coastal Plain|Coastal Plain]] sustained significant damage; much of the state west of [[Raleigh, North Carolina|Raleigh]] escaped unscathed.

In New York City, public schools were closed on [[September 16]], [[1999]], the day Floyd hit the area.  This was a rare decision by the city, as New York City public schools close on average once every few years.  Before Floyd, the last time New York City closed its schools was for the [[Blizzard of 1996]].  After Floyd, the next time New York City Public Schools would close was due to the [[September 11, 2001]], terrorist attacks.

With a death toll of 57, Hurricane Floyd was the deadliest [[United States]] hurricane since [[Hurricane Agnes]] in 1972. The storm also was one of the costliest in the nation's history, amounting to $4.5 billion (1999 USD; $5.3 billion in 2006 U.S. dollars). Most of the deaths and damage were from inland, freshwater flooding in eastern North Carolina.

===Bahamas===

===Southeastern United States===
Although over a million Florida residents were evacuated, the state was only lightly affected by Hurricane Floyd. Strong waves and tropical storm-force winds resulted in significant beach erosion on the east coast of Florida, as well as the loss of some boat piers in [[Brevard County, Florida|Brevard]] and [[Volusia County, Florida|Volusia Counties]]. Moderate rainfall occurred along the coastline, amounting to a maximum of 3.2&nbsp;inches (81&nbsp;mm) in [[Sanford, Florida|Sanford]]. Floyd's winds downed hundreds of trees, damaging 357 houses. Damage in northeast Florida amounted to $46.5 million (1999 USD, $54.5 million 2006 USD), a fraction of what was originally expected.<ref name="tcr"/>

The states of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and [[South Carolina]], although threatened by the storm, were largely spared when it turned northward. Some areas of eastern South Carolina reported up to 16&nbsp;inches (400&nbsp;mm) of rain.<ref name="tcr"/>

===North Carolina===
[[Image:Floyd- Property Damage.gif|left|thumb|Coastal property damage at [[Pine Knoll Shores, North Carolina]]]]
North Carolina received the brunt of the storm's destruction. In all, Hurricane Floyd caused 35 fatalities in North Carolina, much of them from freshwater flooding, as well as billions in damage.
 
[[Image:Floyd1999NCLandfall.gif|right|thumb|Radar imagery of Hurricane Floyd making landfall in North Carolina.]]
The storm surge from the large hurricane amounted to 9&ndash;10&nbsp;feet (2.7&ndash;3&nbsp;m) along the southeastern portion of the state. The hurricane also spawned numerous tornadoes, most of which caused only minor damage. Damage to power lines left over 500,000 customers without electricity at some point during the storm's passage.<ref name="tcr"/>

Just weeks prior to Floyd hitting, [[Hurricane Dennis (1999)|Hurricane Dennis]] brought up to 15&nbsp;inches (38&nbsp;cm) of rain to southeastern North Carolina. When Hurricane Floyd moved across the state in early September, it produced torrential rainfall, amounting to a maximum of 19.06&nbsp;inches (48&nbsp;cm) in [[Wilmington, North Carolina|Wilmington]]. Though it moved quickly, the extreme rainfall was due to Floyd's interaction with an approaching cold front across the area.<ref name="tcr"/>

Extensive flooding led to overflowing rivers; nearly every river basin in eastern North Carolina reached 500 year or greater flood levels.<ref>[http://pubs.usgs.gov/wri/wri004093/summary.html USGS: 1999 North Carolina Flooding: Summary]</ref> Flooding occurred very slowly as the rainfall accumulated in rivers and moved downstream; some areas did not reach peak flood levels for several weeks after the storm (see flood graphic at right). The passage of [[Hurricane Irene (1999)|Hurricane Irene]] four weeks later contributed an additional six inches (150&nbsp;mm) of rain over the still-saturated area, causing further flooding.

The [[Neuse River]], [[Roanoke River]], [[Waccamaw River]], and [[New River (North Carolina)|New River]] exceeded 500-year flood levels, although damage was lower in these areas (compared to the Tar River) because of lower population densities.

[[Image:Floyd1999RadarPANYNJDMP.gif|250px|thumb|left|Floyd's rain affecting the Mid-Atlantic.]]Still a large tropical cyclone when it hit the Mid Atlantic states, Floyd produced a strong storm surge, peaking at 2.8&nbsp;feet (0.8&nbsp;m) with a storm tide of 9.34&nbsp;feet (2.85&nbsp;m) in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] with effects felt in parts of northern Pennsylvania including the [[Wilkes-Barre/Scranton metro area]]. Some 1,260,000 citizens across the three states lost power because of the storm, and flooding left many in Pennsylvania homeless.<ref name="extremes0999"/>

===New England and Canada===
Floyd caused large power outages and flood damage across New England, with over five inches (130&nbsp;mm) of rain being dropped over most of the area.  [[Danbury, Connecticut]] received up to 15&nbsp;inches (380&nbsp;mm) of rain from the storm, resulting in extensive flooding in the city and surrounding areas.  Because New England had been in a severe [[drought]] leading up to Floyd, the storm's floodwaters quickly receded.<ref name="extremes0999"/> 


Because the storm lost tropical characteristics as it entered coastal [[Canada]], effects there were minor, amounting to gusty winds and seas of up to 30&nbsp;feet (9&nbsp;m) in height in the southern[[ Maritimes]]<ref>{{

==Aftermath==
===Criticism of FEMA===
[[Image:Floyd Tar River Flooding.jpg|right|thumb|Flooding in [[Greenville, North Carolina]] on the [[Tar River]]]]
The Hurricane Floyd disaster was followed by what many judged to be a very slow federal response. Fully three weeks after the storm hit, [[Jesse Jackson]] complained to [[Federal Emergency Management Agency|FEMA]] Director [[James Lee Witt]] on his [[CNN]] program ''[[Both Sides Now]]'', "It seemed there was preparation for Hurricane Floyd, but then came Flood Floyd. Bridges are overwhelmed, levees are overwhelmed, whole towns under water ... [it's] an awesome scene of tragedy. So there's a great misery index in North Carolina."  Witt responded, "We're starting to move the camper trailers in. It's been so wet it's been difficult to get things in there, but now it's going to be moving very quickly. And I think you're going to see a &mdash; I think the people there will see a big difference [within] this next weekend!"<ref>{{

===Ecological effects===
[[Image:Floyd runoff.png|thumb|left|Runoff in the aftermath of the hurricane]]
Runoff from the hurricane created significant problems for the ecology of North Carolina's rivers and sounds.

In the immediate aftermath of the storm, freshwater runoff, sediment, and decomposing organic matter caused salinity and oxygen levels in [[Pamlico Sound]] and its tributary rivers to drop to nearly zero.  This raised fears of massive fish and shrimp kills, as had happened after [[Hurricane Fran]] and [[Hurricane Bonnie (1998)|Hurricane Bonnie]], and the state government responded quickly to provide financial aid to fishing and shrimping industries.  Strangely, however, the year's shrimp and crab harvests were extremely prosperous; one possible explanation is that runoff from [[Hurricane Dennis (1999)|Hurricane Dennis]] caused marine animals to begin migrating to saltier waters, so they were less vulnerable to Floyd's ill effects.<ref>{{

Pollution from runoff was also a significant fear. Numerous pesticides were found in low but measurable quantities in the river waters, particularly in the [[Neuse River]]. Overall, however, the concentration of contaminants was slightly lower than had been measured in [[Hurricane Fran]], likely because Floyd simply dropped more water to dilute them.<ref>{{

===Parental stress and child abuse===
A 2004 study by the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]], published in the ''American Journal of Preventive Medicine'', found some evidence that small children living in the hardest-hit part of North Carolina suffered increased rates of child abuse during the six months following the storm. This is likely due to parental stress in rebuilding and grieving their losses in the aftermath of a catastrophe. Dr. Heather T. Keenan, co-author of the study, said, "This information may be useful in future disaster planning. To the extent possible, vulnerable families should receive additional support&mdash;both immediately after a disaster and during the recovery period."<ref>{{

===Retirement===
{{seealso|List of retired Atlantic hurricanes}}
Because of the hurricane's destruction in North Carolina and elsewhere in the United States, the [[World Meteorological Organization]] retired the name ''Floyd'' in the spring of 2000; it will never again be used for an Atlantic hurricane. The name was replaced with ''Franklin'' in the [[2005 Atlantic hurricane season|2005 season]].
