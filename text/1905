'''{{nihongo|Kuriyagawa Hakuson|<U+5EDA><U+5DDD> <U+767D><U+6751>|}}''' ([[19 November]] [[1880]] - [[2 September]] [[1923]]) was the [[pen-name]] of a Japanese [[literary critic]], active in [[Taisho period]] [[Japan]]. His real name was Kuriyagawa Tatsuo.  

==Early life==
Kuriyagawa Hakuson was born in [[Kyoto]]. He graduated from [[Tokyo Imperial University]], where he had studied under [[Koizumi Yakumo]] and [[Natsume Soseki]], and later became a professor at [[Kumamoto University]] and [[Kyoto Imperial University]]. He lectured on 19th century [[Western literature]], and criticized traditional Japanese writing on [[Naturalism (literature)|naturalism]] and [[romanticism]]. His writings include: ''Kindai bungaku jukko'' ("Ten Aspects of Modern Literature", 1912), ''Zoge no to o dete'' ("Leave the Ivory Tower!", 1920) and ''Kindai no ren-aikan'' ("Modern Views on Love", 1922).

In ''Kindai no ren-aikan'' Hakuson regarded "love marriage" (''renai kekkon'') to be a practice indicating an advanced nation and society, as opposed to the practice of [[arranged marriage]],<U+201D> which was more commonly practiced in Japan at the time, 

He was killed by a [[tsunami]], which swept away his cottage near the beach in [[Kamakura, Kanagawa|Kamakura]], [[Kanagawa prefecture]], during the [[Great Kanto Earthquake]] of 1923.
