The '''Robin Hood Cave Horse''' or '''Ochre Horse''' is a fragment of rib engraved with a [[horse]]'s head, discovered in 1876 in the Robin Hood Cave in [[Creswell Crags]], Derbyshire.  It is the only piece of Upper [[Palaeolithic]] art showing an animal to have been found in Britain.<ref name="British Museum">{{cite web|url=http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_prb/h/horse_engraving_on_bone.aspx |title=British Museum - Horse engraving on bone |first= |last=British Museum|work=britishmuseum.org |year=2011 [last update] |accessdate=14 October 2011}}</ref><ref name="MuseumSieveking1987">{{cite book|author1=British Museum|author2=Ann Sieveking|title=A catalogue of palaeolithic art in the British Museum|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=DtCfAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA112|accessdate=14 October 2011|year=1987|publisher=Published for the Trustees of the British Museum by British Museum Publications|isbn=978-0-7141-1376-0|pages=112<U+2013>}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://capra.group.shef.ac.uk/5/pettitt.pdf |title=Discovery, nature and preliminary thoughts about Britain's first cave art Capra '''5''' |first=P B |last=Pettitt |work=capra.group.shef.ac.uk |year=2003 |accessdate=14 October 2011}} Bahn also has a full bibliography</ref> It is now in the [[British Museum]], but not on display.

==Discovery==
Early excavations of the Robin Hood Cave were carried out by Professor Sir [[William Boyd Dawkins]], who wrote several papers on his findings. In July 1876, the [[Reverend J M Mello]] discovered the Ochre Horse at the back of the western chamber in the Robin Hood Cave in [[Creswell Crags]].<ref name="Bahn">{{cite web |url= http://www.mutagenes.net/upper-palaeolithic/paul-g-bahn.html |title=Paul G Bahn Upper Palaeolithic |first=Paul G|last=Bahn|work=mutagenes.net |year=2011 [last update] |quote=The first piece, the famous horse-head engraving (e.g. Dawkins 1880: 185), was found by the Revd J. M. Mello in Robin Hood Cave in July 1876 |accessdate=14 October 2011}}</ref> [[William Boyd Dawkins|Dawkins]] described it as '' 'the head and fore quarters of a horse incised on a smoothed and rounded fragment of rib, cut short off at one end and broken at the other. On the flat side the head is represented with the nostrils and mouth and neck carefully drawn. A series of fine oblique lines show that the animal was hog-maned. They stop at the bend of the back which is very correctly drawn . . .'

There were accusations, in the years after the discovery, then revived in the 1920s, and lingering still today, that the piece is a genuine Paleolithic work, but found in France and fraudulently found or left to be found in the Robin Hood Cave.  Similar accusations were made against a [[Machairodus]] or sabre-toothed cat tooth found at the same time, and equally singular among the many thousands of animal remains excavated at the site.  However modern scientific tests support the local origin of the tooth, which has a similar chemical profile to other local animal remains, and differs from French examples.  In the 1920s, three further fragments claimed as showing engraved animals were found, but these are less widely accepted, and might be wholly caused by natural means, such as the action of roots.<ref>Bahn, as above</ref>  There is also the possibility that the piece was indeed made in France, but carried to Britain (no sea crossing was then needed) in the Paleolithic before being deposited.<ref name="British Museum"/> In 2003 the first British examples of cave art were also found at Creswell Crags.<ref>Bahn; Pettitt - these were two of the team who made the discovery.</ref> 

In 2003, the Ochre Horse was estimated to be between 12,500 and 13,000 years old.<ref name="British Museum"/><ref name="MuseumSieveking1987"/><ref name="hammond">{{cite news|last=Hammond|first=Norman|title=Cave paintings reveal Ice Age artists|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/court_and_social/article749449.ece|accessdate=18 December 2010|newspaper=The Sunday Times|date=7 December 2005}}</ref> The style of the horse inscription resembles drawings found on French Late [[Magdalenian]] sites,<ref name="British Museum"/> where horses are the most popular subject, even though they represent a relatively small proportion of the animal bones found in sites occupied by humans.
