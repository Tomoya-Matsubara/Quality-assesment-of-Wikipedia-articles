'''''Proconsul nyanzae''''' is a species of [[fossil]] [[primate]] first discovered by [[Louis Leakey]] on [[Rusinga Island]] in 1942, which he published in ''Nature'' in 1943. A joint publication of [[Wilfrid Le Gros Clark]] and [[Louis Leakey]] in 1951, "The Miocene Hominoidea of East Africa", first defines ''Proconsul nyanzae''. In 1965 Simons and [[David Pilbeam|Pilbeam]] replaced Proconsul with Dryopithecus, using the same species names.<ref>A now amusing anecdote is told of Louis' reaction to this change by Virginia Morell, "Ancestral Passions", Chapter 21. Louis attended a presentation by the young [[David Pilbeam]], then a graduate student, in Chicago in 1965. Louis interrupted by yelling at Pilbeam to "shut up", among other words. Not finding any support among his mentors and supporters, Pilbeam told Louis to shut up and went on with the presentation. This event is said to have assisted his career.</ref> 

In that same year, Louis defined Kenyapithecus africanus on seven fossils from [[Rusinga Island]]. He saw it as an ancestor of wickeri and also of man, with a date of 20 mya in the middle [[Miocene]]. Another fossil found by the VanCouverings on Rusinga in 1967 seemed to confirm africanus. In 1969 Simons and Plibeam moved ''Kenyapithecus africanus'' into ''Dryopithecus nyanzae''. By 1978 the genus had recovered from the Dryopithecine event and was back to Proconsul. In that year Andrews moved Clark & Leakey's 1951 ''Sivapithecus africanus'' into ''Proconsul nyanzae''.

A more recent discovery by Ward ''et al.'' in 1999 <ref>{{cite journal | author = S. Ward, B. Brown, A. Hill, J. Kelley, W. Downs | year = 1999 | url = http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/285/5432/1382?ijkey=3f46089c39c9b3ec0dfbd1c5e6259cfb88308068#RF2 | title = Equatorius: A New Hominoid Genus from the Middle Miocene of Kenya | journal = Science | volume = 285 | issue = 5432 | pages = 1382<U+2013>1386 | doi = 10.1126/science.285.5432.1382 | pmid = 10464093}}</ref> and reclassification splits ''Kenyapithecus africanus'' away again and lumps it with ''Equatorius africanus'', which would move it to the [[Afropithecinae]] subfamily with ''[[Afropithecus|Afropithecus turkanensis]]''. As ''Proconsul'', ''Kenyapithecus'' may not be in the same clade as apes and humans, but as the older ''Equatorius'', it may be.

==Morphology==
''Proconsul nyanzae'' had a [[Dentition|dental formula]] of 2:1:2:3 on both the upper and lower jaw. The upper premolars of ''Proconsul nyanzae'' were large. This species had a relatively thick enamel on the molars. The [[mandible]] of this [[species]] was relatively robust. ''Proconsul nyanzae'' had an average body mass of about 30.0 kilograms.

==Range==
''Proconsul nyanzae'' lived on the [[continent]] of [[Africa]] and the fossils were found in areas that suggest it lived in a dry, open [[woodland]] [[Ecosystem|environment]].
