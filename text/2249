'''JC's Girls''' (short for '''Jesus Christ's Girls''', also called the '''JC's Girls Girls Girls Ministry''') is an American [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] organization of [[Christian]] women who [[Evangelism|evangelize]] to female workers in the [[sex industry]]. The organization supports women wishing to leave the industry, but does not try to persuade them to do so. The group does not focus upon [[Conversion to Christianity|conversion]] but on communicating its message that Christians exist who are not judging female sex workers and are willing to accept them. The organization also helps people seeking to overcome [[pornography addiction]].

The organization was founded by [[Heather Veitch]], who worked as a [[stripper]] for four years before converting to Christianity in 1999 and eventually leaving the sex industry. She founded JC's Girls on [[Good Friday]] in March 2005; it was based at [[Sandals Church]] in [[Riverside, California]] with the support of the [[California Southern Baptist Convention]]. In January 2006, JC's Girls went to [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] to operate a booth at the [[AVN Adult Entertainment Expo]] that received much traffic and news coverage. Veitch eventually moved to Las Vegas and based the organization at [[Central Christian Church (Henderson, Nevada)|Central Christian Church]] in nearby [[Henderson, Nevada]]. Former stripper and [[call girl]] Theresa Scher and social worker Sheri Brown founded the [[San Diego]] chapter of JC's Girls at [[The Rock Church (San Diego)|The Rock Church]] in 2007. Veitch and Scher resigned from JC's Girls in 2011 and 2012 respectively, leaving the leadership of the organization to Brown. As of 2014, the sole chapter of JC's Girls is in San Diego.

When JC's Girls was first founded, [[pornographic film]] director James DiGiorgio took glamour photographs of three JC's Girls members for the organization's original website without asking for payment. DiGiorgio was not a Christian, but said that he was helping JC's Girls because the sex industry is "always trying to preach freedom of speech [so] anyone in this industry who has a problem with [JC's Girls'] message is a fucking hypocrite."<ref name=Observer/> Reverend Ray Turner of Temple Missionary Baptist Church criticized JC's Girls for not explicitly encouraging women in the sex industry to quit. In response, Veitch said, "Do we ask gluttons to stop eating too much before they come to church?"<ref name=WPVI/> Philip Sherwell of the ''[[Calgary Herald]]'' called the evangelism of JC's Girls "America's most unusual Christian outreach operation".<ref name=Calgary/>

Veitch worked as a stripper for four years<ref name=Seattle/> in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], Nevada and in several cities in California.<ref name=Telegraph/> In 1999, after appearing in four [[pornographic film]]s in the softcore and [[Sexual fetishism|fetish]] genres<ref name=Seattle/>{{mdash}}[[Trampling#Sexual activity|trample fetish]] specifically<ref name=Observer/>{{mdash}}she converted to Christianity and eventually left the sex industry. In 2003, Veitch discovered that a close friend of hers who was working as a stripper had died,<ref name=Seattle/> losing a struggle with [[alcoholism]].<ref name=Telegraph/> Veitch began to evangelize to strippers because she wished she had told her friend about the gospel before she died.<ref name=Seattle>{{Cite news|work=[[The Seattle Times]]|title=Ex-stripper evangelizes to sex industry|author=Stephen Clark|date=April 1, 2006|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=20060401&slug=stripper01|accessdate=December 7, 2013}}</ref>

By 2005, Veitch was working as a hairdresser. One of her clients was Lori Albee,<ref name=Diego/> a housewife with two children and no experience with the sex industry.<ref name=Observer/> Veitch told Albee about her friend who had died and to whom she wished she had evangelized. Albee suggested that they start telling other strippers about Jesus.<ref name=Diego/> Matt Brown, Veitch's pastor at [[Sandals Church]],<ref name=Telegraph/> arrived for a haircut and Veitch asked him for help to start an organization to minister to sex workers. He was interested.<ref name=Charisma>{{Cite news|work=[[Charisma (magazine)|Charisma]]|title=The Stripper Who Found True Love|author=Ed Donnally|date=July 2007|url=http://www.charismamag.com/life/145-j15/features/transformed-lives/2284-the-stripper-who-found-true-love|accessdate=January 5, 2014}}</ref> Veitch and Brown started Matthew's House, an organization they founded as "a ministry to help people working in or addicted to the sex industry".<ref name=Telegraph/>

===Riverside chapter===
On [[Good Friday]] in March 2005, Veitch, Albee and six other women went to a strip club and paid for [[lap dance]]s. Instead of accepting the dances, they talked with the strippers, telling them that they were loved and accepted by God, that churches were composed entirely of sinners, and that they would be welcome there.<ref name=Diego/> One of the lap dancers cried and told Albee she had often wanted to go to a church but had never done so because she had thought that she would be rejected.<ref name=Telegraph/> Albee offered the woman a prayer and she eagerly accepted and hugged Albee. Albee said that talking with women at the strip club changed her life.<ref name=Charisma/> Because the volunteers received more positive responses than they had expected, they decided to continue to evangelize at strip clubs. To organize these activities, Veitch and Albee founded JC's Girls,<ref name=Diego/> with "JC" standing for Jesus Christ.<ref name=Seattle/> They made Matthew's House the parent organization.<ref name=Diego/>

[[File:Heather Veitch and Tanya Huerter at 2006 AEE Thursday.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A photograph of two women looking at the viewer and smiling while wearing black sleeveless shirts, all in front of a black sign with red letters|Tanya Huerter (right), who joined [[Heather Veitch]] (left) as two of JC's Girls' initial three leaders, said, "I believe God created sex for marriage. But God will meet these girls where they are."]]

Veitch became the head of JC's Girls and the 17,000-member Sandals Church became the organization's base of operations.<ref name=Seattle/> The church is part of the [[California Southern Baptist Convention]], which supports JC's Girls.<ref name=Times/> The church gave JC's Girls a $10,000 budget in its first year.<ref name=Seattle/> The organization's members continued visiting strip clubs across California, paying for private dances, and then evangelizing the strippers instead of receiving the dances. Within six months of its founding, the organization's members had persuaded several strippers to start attending a church and were only once asked to stop. By December 2005, Veitch, Albee, and teacher Tanya Huerter had become the organization's leaders.<ref name=Telegraph>{{Cite news|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|title=Former stripper takes God's word to world of porn|author=Catherine Elsworth|date=December 5, 2005|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/1504794/Former-stripper-takes-Gods-word-to-world-of-porn.html|accessdate=December 28, 2013}}</ref> Huerter, who also had no experience with the sex industry, said, "I have a heart for these girls. I believe God created sex for marriage. But God will meet these girls where they are."<ref name=Observer/> Veitch, Albee, and Huerter invited Christian women from other churches in the area to volunteer with JC's Girls and approximately 90 churches responded with interest.<ref name=Charisma/> JC's Girls received public attention in December 2005, when UK newspaper ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' published an article about the organization's activities. The article prompted additional media coverage from other newspapers, television programs, and radio stations. Veitch began dividing her time between managing JC's Girls, appearing in the media, and serving as a caregiver for her [[Terminal illness|terminally-ill]] husband.<ref name=Seattle/> She said that working with JC's Girls helped keep her mind off of her husband's [[Brain tumor|brain cancer]].<ref name=Times/>{{rp|2}}

In January 2006,<ref name=Seattle/> JC's Girls went to Las Vegas to operate a booth at the [[AVN Adult Entertainment Expo]]<ref name=Observer>{{Cite news|work=[[The Observer]]|title=What would Jesus do?: Former $2000-a-night stripper Heather Veitch, now a born-again Christian, tells Gaby Wood why she's bringing the gospel to the 'adult industry'|date=February 12, 2006|url=http://observer.theguardian.com/woman/story/0,,1705362,00.html|accessdate=May 23, 2014}}</ref>{{mdash}}the largest trade fair for [[pornography in the United States]].<ref name=Seattle/> The booth was decorated to look like one of the booths advertising strip clubs. The women at the booth wore sleeveless shirts with the organization's name in sequins. When men attending the convention visited the booth thinking that JC's Girls was a strip club, the women asked them to guess what "JC" meant and gave attendees a sticker that said, "I've been booby-trapped by JC's Girls."<ref name=Observer/> At the convention, JC's Girls distributed more than 200 Bibles wrapped in t-shirts reading "Holy Hottie".<ref name=Seattle/> They also distributed DVDs of a sermon by Brown about pornography addiction.<ref name=Charisma/> The booth became very popular; many convention attendees wished to take pictures with the JC's Girls volunteers. Veitch was interviewed for a variety of media, including a [[CNN]] news broadcast and a documentary film by [[Bill Day (filmmaker)|Bill Day]], who had previously made the film ''Missionary Positions'' about [[XXXchurch.com]], another Christian organization that was operating a booth at the trade fair.<ref name=Observer/> By the end of the convention, the JC's Girls booth had received visits from thousands of men who heard about the gospel there.<ref name=Charisma/>

Also in January 2006, Brown approved a $50,000 budget for JC's Girls for the year. By April, seven strippers had attended Sandals Church because of JC's Girls and various strippers across the United States had contacted the organization looking for local churches to attend. Within a year of founding JC's Girls, Veitch had lost 25 pounds and become more physically fit to show that the organization's message is not motivated by jealousy.<ref name=Seattle/> She said, "I want them to know that if I wanted to, I could be a stripper again, but I choose to live my life for the Lord."<ref name=Times/>

===Las Vegas chapter===

Veitch eventually moved to Las Vegas and based JC's Girls at [[Central Christian Church (Henderson, Nevada)|Central Christian Church]] in nearby [[Henderson, Nevada]].<ref name=Christian/> In 2008, Veitch collaborated with [[Annie Lobert]], a former call girl working with Hookers for Jesus, an organization similar to JC's Girls. The organizations were both represented at that year's AVN Adult Entertainment Expo.<ref>{{Cite news|work=[[Digital Journal]]|title=Hookers For Jesus Are On A Mission|author=KJ Mullins|date=January 28, 2008|url=http://digitaljournal.com/article/249483|accessdate=January 7, 2014}}</ref> ''The PussyCat Preacher'', a documentary film about Veitch's experiences starting JC's Girls, was released that February. The following month, [[pornographic film actor]] Sophia Lynn left the sex industry after becoming a Christian; she underwent more than a year of counselling with Veitch through JC's Girls. Veitch had flown to Sioux Falls, South Dakota, to spend a weekend educating Celebrate Community Church about the sex industry. The church soon gave Lynn a job in its office, a scholarship to go to college, and a place to live. Lynn said, "I hope I don't have to wake up from this.

Based on Veitch's work with Celebrate Community Church, JC's Girls started a program called "One Church for One Girl", which encourages churches to help women to leave the sex industry once the women have expressed an interest in doing so.<ref name="Christian" /> In July 2011, Veitch resigned from JC's Girls so she could spend more time with her family.<ref name=Girls/>

===San Diego chapter===
In San Diego, Theresa Scher, a former stripper and call girl, was looking for a way out of the sex industry when she watched a CNN interview with Albee about her work with JC's Girls in Riverside. Scher contacted Albee, who allowed Scher to establish a new chapter of JC's Girls in San Diego. Sher founded the chapter in 2007<ref name=Diego/> with Sheri Brown, a former social worker.<ref name=Pacific/> Brown had previously hated strippers, but, once she had accepted a job helping [[Teenage_pregnancy#Mother|teenage mothers]] finish [[high school]] and the first four teens she worked with were strippers, she said that she developed "an overwhelming passion to reach out to these precious women in love and without condemnation."

In the first year, several strippers left the sex industry and began volunteering with the chapter. Many of the chapter's members do not personally visit strip clubs but help in other ways.

By 2009, approximately 40 women were on the chapter's active evangelism team,<ref name=KNSD/> and they had given pink Bibles<ref name=McPherson/>{{mdash}}along with other gifts including lip gloss, necklaces, and lotions<ref name=Pacific/>{{mdash}}to most of the strippers in [[San Diego County, California|San Diego County]].<ref name=McPherson>[[Miles McPherson|McPherson]] (2009), p. 159.</ref> In August 2010, Brown went to [[Warsaw, Ohio]], to briefly join forces with Anny Donewald, a former stripper<ref name=Pacific/> and founder of Eve's Angels, an organization similar to JC's Girls.<ref name=Christianity>{{Cite news|work=[[Christianity Today]]|title=A New Message at the Strip Club-Church Showdown|author=Margot Starbuck|date=September 13, 2010 |url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/women/2010/september/new-message-at-strip-club-church-showdown.html| accessdate=January 6, 2014}}</ref> Together, Brown and Donewald negotiated a peace treaty between women working at a strip club and members of a [[local church]] who had been picketing the club for four years.<ref name=Christianity/> The strippers had been counter-protesting by dancing in bikinis in front of the church during Sunday services while Tommy George, the club's owner, played music from his car.

By 2011, several of the strippers JC's Girls members had spoken with in San Diego had begun attending a Bible study hosted by the organization and the chapter had helped one stripper become a Christian, leave the sex industry, and gain unrelated employment.

The woman must consistently attend a [[Bible study (Christian)|Bible study]] for four months, read [[Francine Rivers]]' book ''[[Redeeming Love]]'', and be interviewed by the chapter's leaders, who then decide whether the woman should join the organization's outreach team. These guidelines were established because some women who had quickly gone from working in the sex industry to evangelizing with JC's Girls soon left the organization and returned to the sex industry.<ref name=Post>{{Cite news|work=[[The Christian Post]]|title=Christians Outreach Into Strip Clubs, Porn Conventions to Share Love of Jesus|author=Melissa Barnhart|date=June 26, 2013|url=http://global.christianpost.com/news/christians-outreach-into-strip-clubs-porn-conventions-to-share-love-of-jesus-98899/|accessdate=January 6, 2014}}</ref>

==Reception==

When JC's Girls first started receiving funds from Sandals Church, some of the church's members were displeased that their [[Alms#Christianity|tithes and offerings]] were going towards lap dances. Brown said that funding the activities of JC's Girls was worthwhile because the sex industry "has been largely ignored by the evangelical church" and the budget allotted to JC's Girls is small compared to the money made by the sex industry.<ref name=Seattle/> Sandals Church members were also concerned that ministering to strippers would be ineffective. Brown responded by appealing to Veitch's conversion, suggesting that other strippers could have similar experiences.<ref name=Seattle/> Because of this controversy, Brown nearly lost his church facility on the [[California Baptist University]] campus, but the church united in support of JC's Girls and the church's location remained unchanged.<ref>{{Cite news|work=[[The Christian Post]]|title=Film on Ex-Stripper Turned Preacher Stirs Controversy|author=Michelle A.

In its first year, JC's Girls was criticized for asking DiGiorgio to take glamour photographs<ref name=Telegraph/> of Veitch, Albee, and Huerter<ref name=World/> for their website. Veitch responded to this criticism by saying, "it is not a sin to be attractive or dress cute," and that the photographs were intended to persuade women in the sex industry to dismiss the idea that Christianity is about "being locked up in a house with a Bible."<ref name=Telegraph/> DiGiorgio said that JC's Girls is correct in believing that many women in the sex industry need to be rescued from self-destructive behavior, but he did not think that encouraging the women to become Christians would necessarily be helpful.<ref name=Observer/> At the end of 2005, Veitch said that she had expected that someone would have shouted at JC's Girls members or ejected them from a strip club at some point, but no one had.<ref name=Telegraph/> In 2006, Reverend Ray Turner of Temple Missionary Baptist Church criticized JC's Girls for not explicitly encouraging women in the sex industry to quit.<ref name=Seattle/> He said, "How can you stay in the industry and have a relationship with God?"<ref name=Times/> In response, Veitch said, "Do we ask gluttons to stop eating too much before they come to church?"<ref name=WPVI>{{Cite news|publisher=[[WPVI-TV]]|title=Ex-Stripper Tries Winning Converts|date=February 21, 2006|url=http://abclocal.go.com/wpvi/story?section=news/bizarre&id=3926555|accessdate=December 28, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131230235436/http://abclocal.go.com/wpvi/story?section=news/bizarre&id=3926555|archivedate=December 30, 2013}}</ref> At the 2006 AVN Adult Entertainment Expo, photographer Michael Grecco photographed Veitch, Albee, and Huerter and included the image in his 2007 book ''[[Naked Ambition: An R Rated Look at an X Rated Industry]]''.

Pat Sherman of ''Pacific San Diego Magazine'' said that the members of the San Diego chapter of JC's Girls "have the looks to land jobs working the pole."<ref name=Pacific/> Documentary filmmaker Bill Daly said that JC's Girls are like ''[[Charlie's Angels]]'', but in real life. He said that members of the organization are "fighting false glamour with real spiritual beauty."<ref name=World/> In his book ''Evangelicals and the Arts in Fiction'', John Weaver writes that science fiction writer [[Robert A. Heinlein]] conceived of evangelicals as being sexually repressed, but would eventually undergo a [[sexual revolution]]. Weaver offers JC's Girls and XXXchurch.com as evidence that Heinlein's prediction would be fulfilled.<ref>Weaver (2013), p. 116.</ref> Adherents of [[UFO religion]] [[Ra<U+00EB>lism]] founded an organization called "Ra<U+00EB>l's Girls" in reaction against the practices of JC's Girls in the same way that Ra<U+00EB>lians founded [[Clitoraid]] in reaction against the practice of [[female genital mutilation]]. Like JC's Girls, Ra<U+00EB>l's Girls is an organization of women who engage with female sex workers and their clients. The two organizations differ primarily in their message; Ra<U+00EB>lians hold that sexual pleasure is intrinsically valuable, so members of Ra<U+00EB>l's Girls teach women in the sex industry how to maximize their own sexual pleasure while servicing clients.<ref>Reece (2007), p. 190.</ref> A journalist for ''[[The Observer]]'' compared JC's Girls to XXXchurch.com, writing that both of "these ministries are in some way reforming the church as well as their would-be followers."<ref name=Observer/>
