The '''geology of [[Tennessee]]''' is as diverse as its landscapes. Politically, Tennessee is broken up into three [[Grand Divisions (Tennessee)|Grand Divisions]]: [[East Tennessee|East]], [[Middle Tennessee|Middle]], and [[West Tennessee]]. Physically, Tennessee is also separated into three main types of landforms: river valley plain, highlands and basins, and mountains.

==The Paleozoic==
Most of the sediment across Middle Tennessee was deposited from the [[Ordovician]] to the [[Mississippian (geologic period)|Mississippian]], roughly between 400 and 300 million years ago. The sediment was primarily deep ocean [[limestone]]s with some [[shale]] layers. Mississippian limestones are generally thicker than those of the Ordovician, and additionally, more [[chert]]y. In the Ordovician, the [[Appalachian Mountains]] began to form and by the end of the Paleozoic were tall peaks. During the [[Pennsylvanian]], the [[Cumberland Plateau]] formed along the edge of the Appalachians as beach and shore sediments, primarily [[sandstone]] today. 

==The Mesozoic==
Most Mesozoic sediments were deposited in West Tennessee, along the present course of the [[Tennessee River]]. The famous [[Coon Creek Formation]] is one of these, lay down as a sandy shoreline during the [[Cretaceous]]. Many large sea creatures, including [[mesosaur]]s and [[plesiosaur]]s as well as [[ammonite]]s ruled the seas that covered the area. Because this area was underwater at this time, there are no land [[dinosaur]]s in the fossil record. The Appalachians to the east also experienced erosion at this time and were smoothed down to near their current elevation.

==The Cenozoic==

By the Cenozoic, the sea level had dropped to its current level and the North American continent dried out. The [[Mississippi River]] as well as the Tennessee and [[Cumberland River]]s formed and cut deep into the valleys. The [[Nashville Basin]], which in reality is a [[Dome (geology)|geologic dome]], was pushed up from underneath by a mantle plume, exposing softer strata that with additional erosion on the [[Highland Rim]] surrounding the basin expanded the size of the basin. The basin is likely to continue widening far into the future.

Most Cenozoic deposits occur in West Tennessee near the [[Mississippi embayment]] as sands and silts.
