'''[[Danube Wings]] Flight V5 8230''' was a passenger flight from [[Poprad-Tatry Airport]], [[Slovak Republic]], to [[Dublin Airport]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], on January 2, 2010, that, three days later, caused an international incident due to the mistaken carriage of a sample of [[plastic explosive]] on the plane.

The explosive had been placed in a departing passenger's luggage in Poprad-Tatry Airport as part of a [[sniffer dog]] effectiveness test for [[Airport check-in|checked in]] luggage. The test material was detected by the dogs.  A Slovakian security officer apparently then failed to remove it, and the bag was loaded onto a flight to Dublin. With security checks not generally performed for arrivals, the passenger arrived without incident and took the bag to his home in central Dublin. On January 5, the area was sealed off and evacuated, while Army bomb disposal experts recovered the sample. The passenger was arrested but released without charge.

The Slovak authorities said that the pilot was aware of the mistake and had cleared the flight, and they had told Irish authorities and the passenger the same day. Irish authorities however said they were not made aware of the situation until January 5. The Slovak government apologised to Irish authorities on January 6, and promised an investigation. 

At 96 grammes, the amount of explosive was reportedly enough to manufacture two [[hand grenade]]s (although it was harmless in its transported form, having no [[detonator]]) and exceeded that used in the attempted bombing of [[Northwest Airlines Flight 253|a Christmas Day flight]] to Detroit, Michigan, days earlier.

==Slovak Republic hidden explosives incident==
In an attempt to examine their airport security, Slovakian government authorities planted two different illegal items (a small sample of real explosive and a scent sample) between random pieces of baggage at Poprad-Tatry Airport on the morning of Saturday January 2, 2010.<ref name="Press conference of border police department"/> One of these was placed next to the baggage of a man described as a 49-year-old electrician, originally from the Slovak Republic but who had moved to Dublin, where he had been employed for three years.<ref name="Slovakia apologises for explosives find"/><ref name="Explosive reached Ireland after failed test"/><ref name="Slovak authorities apologise as hidden explosives enter Dublin"/><ref name="Botched Slovak police test sparks explosives scare"/> He was flying back to Dublin after spending [[Christmas]] in the Slovak Republic.<ref name="Slovakia apologises for explosives find"/>

The sniffer dog located both samples, but as the officer on duty had been allegedly called off to another plane, he forgot to remove one of the samples. Baggage with the sample accidentally stuck to it was allowed to be loaded on an aircraft and flown to Dublin, departing on a [[Danube Wings]] flight at 11:00.<ref name="Press conference of border police department"/> The baggage arrived at Dublin airport where, as it was arriving and not departing, it was not checked.<ref name="Slovak authorities apologise as hidden explosives enter Dublin"/>

==Communication failure==
The police officer on duty, after realising his mistake, informed the [[Poprad-Tatry Airport]] flight controllers and in turn the pilot of the plane. The pilot evaluated the situation as not dangerous and decided to continue his flight. Poprad-Tatry Airport flight control operators sent a message to Dublin Airport and informed them about the problem.<ref name="Press conference of border police department">{{cite news |author=Tibor Mako |url=http://www.ta3.com/sk/reportaze/141562_tlacova-konferencia-hranicnej-a-cudzineckej-policie |title=Tla<U+010D>ov<U+00E1> konferencia Hrani<U+010D>nej a cudzineckej pol<U+00ED>cie |date=2010-01-06 |accessdate=2010-01-06 |publisher=''[[TA3]]''}}</ref> Dublin airport officially denied this,<ref name="Dublin Airport Authority">{{cite web |author=Dublin Airport |url=http://www.dublinairport.com/at-airport/latest-news/060110_slovak.html |title=DAA Not Informed About Transportation of Slovak Explosive Until Jan 5 |date=2010-01-06 |accessdate=2010-01-06 |publisher=[[Dublin Airport]] Authority}}</ref> but passengers said that they were waiting for the luggage an unusually long time.<ref name="Press conference of border police department"></ref> Slovak police officials were not informed about the problem until January 5, and they immediately reacted.

==Dublin bomb alert==
On January 5, 2010, the Slovak airport authorities alerted their colleagues at Dublin Airport, who then told the [[Garda S<U+00ED>och<U+00E1>na]] of the security breach.<ref name="Explosive reached Ireland after failed test"/><ref name="Air passenger held after security-test officials plant explosives"/> They also alerted the man via his mobile phone at around the same time, telling him what he had unwittingly done.<ref name="Slovak authorities apologise as hidden explosives enter Dublin"/> They alleged they had earlier sent a [[telex]] in advance to alert Ireland.<ref name="Botched Slovak police test sparks explosives scare"/> The man's flight details were examined by Irish authorities and his residence located and raided.<ref name="Slovak authorities apologise as hidden explosives enter Dublin"/>

A major bomb alert took place in the area surrounding his apartment on Dublin's [[Dorset Street (Dublin)|Dorset Street]], near the city's important [[O'Connell Street]].<ref name="Danger Explosive Transported to Ireland After Failed Security Test in Slovakia"/> A section of the road was sealed off, homes were evacuated, and traffic on several nearby streets was diverted.<ref name="Man arrested following explosives find"/> Two streets were locked down for at least an hour.<ref name="Explosive reached Ireland after failed test"/> At 12:05, the bomb alert ended.<ref name="Slovak authorities apologise as hidden explosives enter Dublin"/>
