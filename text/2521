'''''Terang Boelan''''' (released internationally as '''''Full Moon''''') is a 1937{{efn|Some sources, such as {{harvtxt|Anwar|2004|p=84}}, give the release year as 1938.}} film written by [[Saeroen]] and directed by [[Albert Balink]]. Starring [[Rd. Mochtar]], [[Roekiah]], and E. T. Effendi, it followed two lovers who elope after one is nearly forced to marry an [[opium]] smuggler. Shot in the [[Dutch East Indies]] and Singapore and targeted at [[native Indonesians|native]] audiences, the film featured ''[[kroncong]]'' music and several actors from Balink's previous work ''[[Pareh]]'' (1936).

''Terang Boelan'' was a commercial success, earning 200,000 [[Straits dollar]]s in [[British Malaya]]. This revived the faltering film industry in the colony and inspired native-oriented movies in Malaya. Modern critical reception of the [[lost film]] has generally been positive, although complaints have been targeted at the formulaic nature of later films which followed ''Terang Boelan''{{'s}} formula.

==Plot==
Rohaya ([[Roekiah]]) must separate from her lover, Kasim ([[Rd. Mochtar]]), so that she can marry her father's choice, the disreputable but rich Musa (E. T. Effendi). The night before the wedding, Kasim plays the song "[[Terang Bulan|Terang Boelan]]" for Rohaya, and they agree to [[elope]]. The following day, Rohaya and Mochtar escape from Sawoba Island to [[Malacca]], where Kasim begins work at a [[drydock]] and Rohaya keeps busy as a housewife. They discover that Kasim's old friend, Dullah ([[Kartolo]]), has lived in Malacca for some time.

However, their life together is interrupted when Musa, who is actually an [[opium]] dealer, discovers them. While Kasim is away at work, Rohaya's father (Muhin) comes and takes her back to Sawoba. Kasim, having discovered Musa's deeds, returns to his hometown and rallies the villagers by telling them of Musa's opium dealings. He then begins fighting with Musa. As it looks as if he will lose the fight, he is saved by Dullah, who had followed him back to Sawoba. The villagers and Rohaya's father agree that Kasim and Rohaya should be together, as they are truly in love.{{efn|Plot derived from {{harvtxt|Said|1982|pp=24<U+2013>26}} and {{harvtxt|Biran|2009|pp=169<U+2013>170}}}}

==Production==
During 1934 and early 1935, all feature films released in the [[Dutch East Indies]] had been produced by [[The Teng Chun]], based on [[Chinese mythology]] or martial arts;{{sfn|Biran|2009|pp=380<U+2013>382}} this situation was an effect of the [[Great Depression]] and changing market trends.{{efn|The Great Depression had led to the Dutch East Indies government collecting higher taxes, advertisers asking for more money, and cinemas selling tickets at lower prices; this ensured that there was a very low [[profit margin]] for local films. During this period cinemas in the colony mainly showed [[Hollywood]] productions {{harv|Biran|2009|p=145}}.}}{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=145}} The Dutchman [[Albert Balink]], despite having no formal film experience, had produced ''[[Pareh]]'' (''Rice'') in 1935, joining with the [[Chinese Indonesians|ethnic Chinese]] [[Wong brothers]] (Othniel and Joshua) and Dutch documentarian [[Mannus Franken]]{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=155, 159}} in an attempt to show that locally-produced, well-made films could be profitable. ''Pareh'' was a failure and bankrupted the producers,{{sfn|Biran|2009|pp=161<U+2013>162}} leaving The to dominate the industry for a further two years.{{sfn|Biran|2009|pp=380<U+2013>382}}

By late 1936 Balink had found financial backing and opened the [[Jakarta|Batavia]]- (now Jakarta-) based Dutch Indies Film Syndicate ({{lang|nl|Algemeen Nederlandsch Indisch Filmsyndicaat}}, or ANIF), which focused mainly on [[newsreel]]s and documentaries, with the Wongs and Franken. On 1&nbsp;January 1937 ANIF announced that it would produce several [[feature film]]s, one of which was ''Terang Boelan''.{{sfn|Biran|2009|pp=165<U+2013>168}}{{sfn|Said|1982|p=142}} As opposed to The, who targeted his films at lower-class audiences, Balink targeted his film at educated [[Native Indonesians]].{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=146}} According to the Indonesian film critic Salim Said, this arose from Balink's experience with ''Pareh'' and resulted in a less [[ethnological]] approach.{{sfn|Said|1982|pp=23<U+2013>24}}

The story for ''Terang Boelan'' was written by [[Saeroen]], a reporter with the newspaper ''Pemandangan'' who had close connections to the theatrical community.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=169}} The film was written shortly after the domestic release of the American-produced [[Dorothy Lamour]] vehicle ''[[The Jungle Princess]]'' (1936), which served as an inspiration.{{sfn|van der Heide|2002|p=128}} The Indonesian film historian [[Misbach Yusa Biran]] wrote that this gave ''Terang Boelan'' stylistic and thematic similarities to the earlier film.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=170}} Said also recognised such similarities, describing ''Terang Boelan'' as reflecting the "jungle princess" works popular at the time.{{sfn|Said|1982|p=11}} Saeroen named the fictional island on which ''Terang Boelan'' takes place, Sawoba, after the crew: Saeroen, Wong, and Balink.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=169}}

[[File:A Wong Brother KR 30 April 1947.jpg|thumb|upright|One of the [[Wong brothers]], {{circa}} 1947; the Wongs' collaboration with Balink on ''Terang Boelan'' was their second, after ''[[Pareh]]''.]]
Filming began by February 1937, under Balink's direction and with the Wongs on camera.{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Kredit Lengkap}} Sources conflict on whether Franken was involved; Biran wrote that Franken had been left in charge of the studio's documentaries,{{sfn|Biran|2009|pp=165<U+2013>168}} while the American film scholar [[Karl G. Heider]] recorded Franken as co-directing the film.{{sfn|Heider|1991|p=15}} Scenes were shot in black-and-white at [[Cilincing]] in Batavia, Merak Beach in [[Banten]], and [[Tanjong Katong]] in Singapore,{{sfn|Esha|Alhaziri|Fauzi|Donald W.|2005|p=32}}{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Terang Boelan}} and used highly flammable [[nitrate film]].{{sfn|Deocampo|2006|pp=1917-1919}}

The cast of ''Terang Boelan'' mostly consisted of actors who had appeared in ''Pareh''. This included the [[leading actor]], Rd. Mochtar, and several minor players, including E. T. Effendi and Soekarsih. Other cast members, including the [[leading lady]] Roekiah and her husband Kartolo, were drawn from traditional ''toneel'' theatrical troupes. The film, which included the songs "Terang Boelan" and "Boenga Mawar" ("Rose"), required its cast to sing ''[[keroncong]]'' music (traditional music with [[Portuguese colonialism in Indonesia|Portuguese]] influences); as Mochtar was unable to perform, [[Ismail Marzuki]]&nbsp;<U+2013> later known as a composer&nbsp;<U+2013> sang while Mochtar [[lip sync]]ed.{{sfn|Said|1982|pp=23<U+2013>24}}{{sfn|van der Heide|2002|p=128}}{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=171}} Marzuki also provided the film's music.{{sfn|Esha|Alhaziri|Fauzi|Donald W.|2005|p=32}}

==Release and reception==
''Terang Boelan'' was released in 1937; it was also marketed under the Dutch title ''Het Eilan der Droomen''.{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Terang Boelan}}{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=25}} it made its premier at the Rex Theatre in Batavia.{{sfn|Esha|Alhaziri|Fauzi|Donald W.|2005|p=32}} The film was advertised as proving that the Indies were as beautiful as Hawaii, a popular island paradise in contemporary films. Posters also emphasised the use of Indonesian;{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Terang Boelan}} William van der Heide, a lecturer on film studies at the [[University of Newcastle (Australia)|University of Newcastle]] in Australia, notes  that the film continued a trend of "Indonesianisation", or a national identity, which had been present for several years.{{sfn|van der Heide|2002|p=128}}

The film was a commercial success, both in the Indies and internationally; native audiences included native fans of ''toneel'' and ''kroncong'' who rarely went to the cinema,{{sfn|van der Heide|2002|p=128}}{{sfn|Said|1982|p=25}} and much of the audience consisted of people from the lower classes.{{sfn|Deocampo|2006|pp=1917-1919}} After being licensed by [[RKO Pictures|RKO Radio Pictures]], the film was screened in [[British Malaya]], where it was advertised as "the first and best Malay musical" and earned 200,000 [[Straits dollar]]s (then equivalent to [[US$]] 114,470<!--, or <U+00A3>23,180-->{{sfn|New York Times 1938, Foreign Exchange}}) in two months.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=171}}{{sfn|Esha|Alhaziri|Fauzi|Donald W.|2005|p=33}}{{sfn|Barnard|2010|p=52}} ''Terang Boelan'' proved to be the most successful production in the area until 1953's ''Krisis'' (''Crisis''), released after Indonesia had become independent.{{sfn|Anwar|2004|p=84}}

However, ANIF was displeased with the film and halted its other non-documentary productions. One of the studio's cameramen, an [[Indo people|Indo]] named Steffens,{{efn|Sources do not indicate his first name.}} suggests that ANIF's management preferred works of non-fiction. As a result of the company's reaction, Balink left the Indies and immigrated to the United States.{{sfn|Biran|2009|pp=172<U+2013>173}} Other cast and crew members also left the company and joined [[Tan's Film]], including the Wongs,{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=174}} following a short tour in Malaya.{{sfn|Esha|Alhaziri|Fauzi|Donald W.|2005|p=33}} Mochtar and Roekiah became a popular screen couple beginning with the company's production ''Fatima'', which kept much of the cast of ''Terang Boelan''; they stayed booked together until Mochtar left the company in 1940.{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Terang Boelan}}{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=214}} Mochtar also married fellow ''Terang Boelan'' actress Soekarsih.{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Pareh}}

==Legacy==
[[File:Siti Akbari postcard 1.jpg|thumb|After the success of ''Terang Boelan'' much of the cast, including stars [[Roekiah]] and [[Rd Mochtar]] ''(pictured in ''[[Siti Akbari]]'')'', were signed to [[Tan's Film]].]]
The success of ''Terang Boelan'' led to an "explosion" in film production in the colony, many of these films following the same formula, including songs, beautiful scenery, and romance.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=25}}{{sfn|Said|1982|p=25}} Before the film was released, local studios had generally been unsuccessful in finding a premise popular with audiences,{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=87}} but the triple successes of ''Terang Boelan'', ''Fatima'', and ''[[Alang-Alang (film)|Alang-Alang]]'' (''Grass''; 1939) revived the industry.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=182}} Four new [[production house]]s were established in 1940,{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=205}} and actors and actresses previously attached to theatrical troupes entered the film industry, which was reaching new audiences.{{sfn|Said|1982|p=27}} Most locally-produced films [[List of films of the Dutch East Indies|films released in the Indies]] were made between 1939 and the [[Japanese occupation of Indonesia|Japanese occupation]] in 1942.{{sfn|Biran|2009|pp=383<U+2013>385}} Meanwhile, in Malaya, the brothers [[Run Run Shaw|Run Run]] and [[Runme Shaw]], drawing inspiration from ''Terang Boelan'' and ''Alang-Alang''{{'s}} success with Malay audiences, established Malay Film Productions in Singapore. The studio was one of the more successful in the colony.{{sfn|Khoo|2006|p=90}}

Heider considered ''Terang Boelan'' one of the two most important cinematic works from the Dutch East Indies during the 1930s; Balink's earlier film ''Pareh'' was the other.{{sfn|Heider|1991|p=15}} Biran considered the film a turning point in the history of [[Indonesian cinema]], showing the possibilities of the medium;{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=169}} Said concurred, describing the film as a milestone in Indonesia's history.{{sfn|Said|1982|pp=23<U+2013>24}} However, the repeated use of its formula has been criticised. The director [[Teguh Karya]], for instance, was heavily critical of films which used the same formula as ''Terang Boelan'' without building on it.{{sfn|Heider|1991|pp=6, 16}}

''Terang Boelan'' is considered [[Lost film|lost]],{{sfn|Said|McGlynn|Heider|1991|p=31}} as are most domestic productions from the era.{{efn|{{harvtxt|Heider|1991|p=14}} writes that all Indonesian films from before 1950 are lost. However, JB Kristanto's ''Katalog Film Indonesia'' (''Indonesian Film Catalogue'') records several as having survived at [[Sinematek Indonesia]]'s archives, and {{harvtxt|Biran|2009|p=351}} writes that several Japanese propaganda films have survived at the [[Netherlands Government Information Service]].}} The Filipino film historian and director [[Nick Deocampo]] noted that productions made with nitrate film burned easily and were thus easily lost, but suggested that copies of ''Terang Boelan'' may have survived until the 1970s.{{sfn|Deocampo|2006|pp=1917-1919}} In a 1991 publication Said, Heider, and the American translator [[John H. McGlynn]] expressed hope that copies of the film have survived in "attics" in Indonesia or the Netherlands.{{sfn|Said|McGlynn|Heider|1991|p=31}}
