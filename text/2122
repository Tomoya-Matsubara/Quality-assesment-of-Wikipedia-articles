==Plot==
When the Simpsons family gets new cool neighbors Terrence and Emily from [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]],<ref name="oregonian"/><ref name="spinoff"/> Homer is desperate to fit in with their lifestyle so he himself can become cool. However, during the couple's son T-Rex's birthday party, T-Rex is rude about Homer, insulting a present he made for him. Angered by this, [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] defends his father and fights him. Meanwhile, [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] is disturbed by Emily and her friends' [[breastfeeding]] of their babies, revealing that she only gives [[Maggie Simpson|Maggie]] baby formula. These altercations cause Homer to be ostracized by Terrence, Emily, and their friends. Enraged by this, Homer wages a war with Terrence and Emily, who reveal that they have called in all of the cool people from Portland. Soon, [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]] is overrun by the cool people, overwhelming Homer and Marge. Meanwhile, Bart and T-Rex reconcile, and Bart invites T-Rex to watch TV with him. T-Rex obliges, abandoning a compost harvester owned by his family, which causes a fire that engulfs Terrence and Emily's house. Homer and Terrence arrive to the devastation and work together to put out the fire using a large collection of baby formula bottles bought by Marge. Terrence and Emily apologize to Homer and Marge and plan on staying in Springfield, but they change their minds when they find that all of the cool people have moved to Springfield, therefore making the town "played out". The family leaves with all of the other cool people, much to [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]]'s dismay.

==Production==
