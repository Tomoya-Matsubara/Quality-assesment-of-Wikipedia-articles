'''Benjamin Claude Cecil Tipper''' ([[7 July]] [[1896]] - [[11 July]] [[1970]]) was an [[England|English]] [[cricketer]] who played five [[first-class cricket|first-class]] matches for [[Worcestershire County Cricket Club|Worcestershire]] in [[1919 English cricket season|1919]]. All were friendlies, as Worcestershire did not re-enter the [[County Championship]] until [[1920 English cricket season|the following year]].

Tipper made his debut on [[23 June]] against [[Gloucestershire County Cricket Club|Gloucestershire]], and his 42 in the first innings helped avert a crisis; he had come in with the score on 27/5, but his steadying knock helped the team to 201. He also took 2-49 in Gloucestershire's own first innings (his first victim being his near-namesake [[Alfred Dipper]]), but second time around he was out for 3 and he took no more wickets before the game finished in [[the result in cricket|a draw]].

He had no notable success in his next three games, although in mid-August (once more against Gloucestershire) he took the final two wickets in the first innings to record his best [[bowling analysis]] of 1.2-1-0-2. He played only one more first-class match, against [[Warwickshire County Cricket Club|Warwickshire]] a week later. Here he made 43, his career best, and 0; his five overs of bowling were unsuccessful.

Tipper was born in [[King's Norton]], then in [[Worcestershire]], and died just after his 74th birthday in [[Norton Lindsay]], [[Warwickshire]].
