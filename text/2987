"'''Spotlight'''" is a song by American recording artist [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]. It appeared on her 1987 remix compilation ''[[You Can Dance]]'', and was released as a single in Japan on April 25, 1988 by [[Sire Records]]. Initially rejected during her ''[[True Blue (album)|True Blue]]'' album recording sessions, "Spotlight" was written by Madonna, [[Stephen Bray]] and Curtis Hudson. It was inspired by the song "[[Everybody Is a Star]]" (1970), by American rock band [[Sly and the Family Stone]]. "Spotlight" was remixed by [[Shep Pettibone]], with additional mixing done by [[John Benitez|John "Jellybean" Benitez]].

"Spotlight" features instrumentation from [[drum programming|drums]], [[bass synthesizer|bass synths]] and [[clapping|handclaps]], accompanied by [[echo (phenomenon)|vocal echos]], a piano segment and violin phrases in the musical interlude. The lyrics talk about how one can be famous if one sings about it. The song received mixed reviews from critics. After its release, "Spotlight" reached number-three on the Japanese [[Oricon]] Singles Chart. Although not released in the United States, "Spotlight" managed to chart on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''{{'}}s Airplay chart in early 1988. The song was used in a [[Mitsubishi]] [[Videocassette recorder|VCR]] commercial, where she appeared.

==Background==
By the mid-eighties, post-disco dance music was extremely popular and the concept of [[remix]] was widely regarded as a new direction of music. Several artists were remixing their tracks and compiling them to create new albums. Hence Madonna, who was the most popular dance artist of that era, decided to create a similar remix compilation album, later titled ''[[You Can Dance]]'', which included seven of her up-tempo songs.<ref name="tara1"/> Along with the pre-released tracks in remixed form, "Spotlight" was included as an added bonus. Madonna said that she was inspired by the song "[[Everybody Is a Star]]" (1970), by American rock band [[Sly and the Family Stone]].<ref name="rikky">{{harvnb|Rooksby|2004|p=28}}</ref>

Written by Madonna, [[Stephen Bray]] and Curtis Hudson, "Spotlight" was originally recorded during the 1986 ''[[True Blue (album)|True Blue]]'' album recording sessions. It was omitted from ''True Blue'' because Madonna felt that it was similar in composition and structure with her previous single "[[Holiday (Madonna song)|Holiday]]" (1983).<ref name="tara1">{{harvnb|Taraborrelli|2002|p=129}}</ref> When Madonna decided to create ''You Can Dance'', she asked [[Shep Pettibone]], who had remixed her songs from ''True Blue'', to remix "Spotlight" and included it on the album.<ref name="tara1"/> [[John Benitez|John "Jellybean" Benitez]], who had recorded the original demo during the ''True Blue'' sessions, assisted Pettibone in remixing the song.<ref name="rikky"/>

"Spotlight" begins with the sound of [[drum programming|drums]], [[bass synthesizer|bass synths]] and [[clapping|handclaps]], followed by Madonna uttering the words "Spotlight, shine bright". After the first [[verse (popular music)|verse]], the sound of keyboard is heard during the [[chorus effect|effect]].<ref name="rikky2">{{harvnb|Rooksby|2004|p=29}}</ref> It continues like this through the second verse, which is followed by an [[Break (music)|interlude]] featuring [[echo (phenomenon)|vocal echos]], a piano segment and violin phrases. Madonna follows the music played by the piano and utters the words "Pa-da-pa-da-pappa pappa pa pa" in the same melody.<ref name="rikky2"/> The lyrics deal with Madonna making the listener remember that "Everybody is a Star" and that if one wants to be famous and be under the "Spotlight", the person should sing about it and reality may catch up with him or her.<ref name="rikky2"/> According to the sheet music published at SheetMusicPlus.com, the song is set in the [[time signature]] of common time, with a tempo of 100 [[beats per minute]]. It is set in the key of [[F major]] with Madonna's voice spanning from the notes of C<sub>5</sub> to B{{music|flat}}m. "Spotlight" has a basic sequence of Am<U+2013>C<U+2013>Am<U+2013>C<U+2013>G<U+2013>F as its [[chord progression]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Digital Sheet Music <U+2013> Madonna <U+2013> "Spotlight"|work=''SheetMusicPlus.com''|publisher=[[Alfred Publishing]]}}</ref>
