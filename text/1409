'''Edward Hitchcock Jr.''' (1828 <U+2013> February 15, 1911) was an American physical educator.
==Biography== 
Born to [[Edward Hitchcock]] Sr., the renowned geologist and President of [[Amherst College]] and wife Orra White, Hitchcock attended [[Williston Seminary]] as a boy and continued his education while following in his father's footsteps by entering Amherst College in the fall of 1845. Hitchcock Jr. graduated from Amherst college in 1849, and later pursued a doctorate at [[Harvard Medical School]]. After receiving his doctorate, he married Mary Judson in 1853. They had ten children; three of whom died in infancy. Hitchcock Jr. returned to Amherst College in 1861 as professor of [[Hygiene]] and [[Physical Education]]. Hitchcock Jr. was the first ever physical educator.

==History== 
Colleges had hired physical educators since the early 1820s, but Edward Hitchcock Jr. is generally credited with being the first formal physical educator at the collegiate level. He believed in the importance of sound [[physical health]] for college students, so that the mind could accomplish its best work and students could look forward to "the promised labor of a long life." To achieve that goal, he developed systems of [[physical training]] intended to appeal to the students both mentally and physically. His program at Amherst became a model for [[college]] and [[secondary school]] programs nationally and internationally. The development of this first college program was Hitchcock's major contribution to the field of physical education.

==Contributions==
Edward Hitchcock Jr. contributed to Amherst College not only with his enlightened ideas concerning physical education, but also with his genuine personality. Hitchcock Jr. was noted as a kind, broad-minded, vigorous, optimistic, honest, faithfully religious man with shrewd [[common sense]] and an intense loyalty to the college. Students were known for being rather fond of Hitchcock Jr. as well, and he was often affectionately referred to as "Old Doc". 

Old Doc is a noted "crusader for [[fitness]]" he created schedules for [[physical exercise]]s to be completed at the college. <ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=nGcDUS7WUqYC&pg=PA23&lpg=PA23&dq=edward+hitchcock+jr+crusader+for+fitness&source=bl&ots=zdNg1MEEw_&sig=7rnT76UyWMB_ahaw691dmdE5PB4&hl=en&ei=khWBTdC6N4GN0QHC0-H9CA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CBcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false An Annotated Catalogue of the Edward ... - Google Books<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>. While Edward Hitchcock Jr. actively practiced and taught physical education at Amherst, he also conducted [[research]] and intently studied the scientific functions that applied to his phys ed ideas. Hitchcock Jr. even worked with his aforementioned father Edward Hitchcock Sr to compile a [[textbook]] titled, <ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=ll1JAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=elementary+anatomy+and+physiology+for+colleges+academies+and+other+schools&source=bl&ots=scml_7zri3&sig=29TgPpDCtVO5NgTSRdGYNO2xVZw&hl=en&ei=WRWBTdXPK5CkuAO-v7XKBw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&sqi=2&ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false Elementary anatomy and physiology ... - Google Books<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Elementary Anatomy and Physiology For Colleges, Academies and Other Schools.
