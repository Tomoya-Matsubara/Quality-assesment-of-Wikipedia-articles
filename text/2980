'''Jane Haining''' was a [[Church of Scotland]] [[missionary]].

Born in [[Dumfries]], [[Scotland]], in 1897, she volunteered for service in [[1932]] as a matron of the girls' home at the Scottish Mission School in [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]]. At the outbreak of [[World War II]] she refused to return to Scotland as ordered, determined to remain with her girls. After the [[Operation Margarethe|Nazi invasion of Hungary]] in 1944, she again refused to leave. Although she did not avoid incarceration by the Nazi regime, many of her pupils were spared deportation to [[Auschwitz]]. On [[July 27]], [[1944]] she died "in hospital" at Auschwitz. She is one of a total of ten Scots thought to have been put to death in the Nazi extermination camps.

Among the memorials to Jane Haining are two stained glass windows in [[Queen's Park, Glasgow|Queen's Park]] church, Glasgow, where she worshipped, and a plaque in the little Kirk of Dunscore. Pelicula Films are to produce a film about Haining titled ''There Are Mountains On The Road to Heaven''. The film, a Hungarian co-production, will be backed by [[Scottish TV]], Screen Screen and the [[European Commission]]. The director of the film will be Mark Littlewood and it will feature the talents of producer Ian Smith and screen writer Chris Dolan. The film will be based on interviews with four pupils who survived, Dr. Zsuzanna Pajs, Dr. Maria Kremer, Ibolya Suranyi (Budapest), and Annette Lantos (Washington) [http://www.sundayherald.com/47038] [http://www2.variety.com/mipTV2005_listings.asp?company_id=2527].
