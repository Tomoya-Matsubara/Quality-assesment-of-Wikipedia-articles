== History and overview ==
[[Image:AndrewSchlafly.jpg|right|thumb|Conservapedia founder [[Andrew Schlafly]]]]
Conservapedia was created in November 2006 by Andrew Schlafly, a [[Harvard University|Harvard]] and [[Princeton University|Princeton]]-educated attorney and a homeschool teacher.<ref name="efu"/> He felt the need to start the project after reading a student's assignment written using [[Common Era]] dating notation rather than the [[Anno Domini]] system that he preferred.<ref name="LA Times"/>  Although he was "an early Wikipedia enthusiast", as reported by Shawn Zeller of ''[[Congressional Quarterly]]'', Schlafly became concerned about [[bias]] after Wikipedia editors repeatedly reverted his edits to the article about the [[Kansas evolution hearings|2005 Kansas evolution hearings]].<ref name="NYTimes" /> Schlafly expressed hope that Conservapedia would become a general resource for American educators and a counterpoint to the [[Wikipedia bias#Systemic bias in coverage|liberal bias that he perceived in Wikipedia]].<ref name="NPR_conservapedia">{{cite web |url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=8286084 |title=Conservapedia: Data for Birds of a Political Feather? |accessdate=2007-07-26 |last=Siegel |first=Robert |date=2007-03-13}}</ref><ref name="The Star">{{cite news |last=Chung |first =Andrew |url=http://www.thestar.com/sciencetech/article/190501 |title=A U.S. conservative wants to set Wikipedia right |work=The Star.com |date=2007-03-11 | location=Toronto}}</ref><ref name="Guardian">{{cite news | last = Johnson | first = Bobbie |  url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,,2024434,00.html | title = Rightwing website challenges 'liberal bias' of Wikipedia | work = The Guardian | date = 2007-03-01 | location=London}}</ref>

The "Eagle Forum University" online education program, which is associated with [[Phyllis Schlafly]]'s [[Eagle Forum]] organization, uses material for various online courses, including U.S. history, stored on Conservapedia.<ref name="heise">{{Cite news |date=2007-03-02 |url=http://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/86145 |title=Conservapedia: christlich-konservative Alternative zu Wikipedia |work=Heise Online }} {{de icon}}</ref><ref name="Lectures">{{cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia = Conservapedia |year=2007 |url=http://www.conservapedia.com/index.php?title=American_History_Lecture_One&oldid=136744 |title = American History Lecture One | accessdate = 2007-03-05 }}</ref><ref name="History 101">{{cite web | publisher = Eagle Forum University | date = 2007-04-30 | url = http://eagleforumu.org/EAGLEFORUMU/student/course/class/view.cfm?int_course_id=25&classID=134#classLinks | title = American History 101| accessdate = 2007-03-05 }}</ref> Editing of Conservapedia articles related to a particular course topic is also a certain assignment for Eagle Forum University students.<ref name="History 101"/>

== Editorial viewpoints and policies ==
Conservapedia has editorial policies designed to prevent what Schlafly sees as structural and ideological problems{{Clarify|date=December 2010}} with Wikipedia and generalized vandalism.

=== Differences from Wikipedia ===
Many editorial practices of Conservapedia differ from those of [[Wikipedia]]. Articles and other content on the site frequently include criticism of Wikipedia as well as criticism of its alleged liberal ideology.<ref name="The Star"/>
Launching the online encyclopedia project, Schlafly asserted the need for an alternative to Wikipedia due to editorial philosophy conflicts. The site's "Conservapedia Commandments"<ref name="Conservapedia commandments">{{cite web|title=Conservapedia Commandments|url=http://www.conservapedia.com/index.php?title=Conservapedia:Commandments&oldid=429378|publisher=Conservapedia|date=2008-04-12|accessdate=2008-04-12}}</ref> differ from Wikipedia's editorial policies, which include following a neutral point of view<ref name="NPOV Wikipedia">{{cite web |url=http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view&oldid=102236018|title=Wikipedia:Neutral point of view |publisher=Wikipedia |date=2007-01-21|accessdate=2008-06-26}}</ref> and avoiding [[original research]].<ref name="Attribution Wikipedia">{{cite web |url=http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Attribution |title=Wikipedia:Attribution |publisher=Wikipedia |accessdate=2008-06-26}}</ref><ref name="Guidelines on Cwiki">{{cite web |url=http://www.conservapedia.com/index.php?title=Conservapedia:Guidelines&oldid=461391#Attribution|title=Conservapedia:Guidelines |publisher=Conservapedia |date=2008-05-27|accessdate=2008-06-26}}</ref> In response to Wikipedia's core policy of neutrality, Schlafly has stated: "It's impossible for an encyclopedia to be neutral. I mean let's take a point of view, let's disclose that point of view to the reader",<ref name="NPR_conservapedia" /> and "Wikipedia does not poll the views of its editors and administrators. They make no effort to retain balance. It ends up having all the neutrality of a [[lynch mob]]".<ref name="wired" />

In a March 2007 interview with ''[[The Guardian]]'', Schlafly stated, "I've tried editing Wikipedia, and found it and the biased editors who dominate it censor or change facts to suit their views. In one case my factual edits were removed within 60&nbsp;seconds<U+2014>so editing Wikipedia is no longer a viable approach".<ref name="Guardian"/> On March 7, 2007, Schlafly was interviewed on [[BBC Radio 4]]'s flagship morning show, ''[[Today (BBC Radio 4)|Today]]'', opposite Wikipedia administrator Jim Redmond. Schlafly raised several concerns: that the article on the [[Renaissance]] does not give any credit to Christianity, that Wikipedia articles apparently prefer to use non-American spellings even though most users are American, that the article on [[Philippine<U+2013>American War|American activities in the Philippines]] has a distinctly anti-American bias, and that attempts to include pro-Christian or pro-American views are removed very quickly. In response to Schlafly's claim that the Wikipedia policy of allowing both Common Era and Anno Domini notation was anti-Christian bias,<ref name="IWR">Thomson, Iain (2007) [http://www.iwr.co.uk/information-world-review/news/2184351/conservapedia-takes-wikipedia "Conservapedia takes on Wikipedia 'bias'"] ''Information World Review'', February 28.

He also cited the Wikipedia policies regarding citation of sources and cooperation with other contributors as basis for allowing any factual information to be added.<ref name="bbc">{{cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/today/listenagain/ram/today4_wikipedia_20070307.ram |date=March 7, 2007<!-- 8:16am--> |accessdate=2007-04-09 |title=Today programme |publisher=BBC Radio 4 |format=[[RealPlayer]]}}</ref>

=== Conflict with scientific views ===
Various Conservapedia articles have been challenged from a scientific perspective. Although not all contributors subscribe to a [[young earth creationist]] point of view - senior administrator Terry Koeckritz stated to the [[LA Times]] that he does not take the Genesis creation account literally<ref name="LA Times"/>{{rp|9}} - sources have attributed the poor science coverage to an overall editorial support of the YEC perspective and an over-reliance on home schooling textbooks.<ref name="NPR_conservapedia"/><ref name="heise" /><ref name="Metro">{{cite web |url=http://www.metro.co.uk/weird/article.html?in_article_id=41802&in_page_id=2 |title=Weird, wild wiki on which anything goes |accessdate=2007-03-25 |date=2007-03-19 |work=[[Metro (Associated Metro Limited)|Metro]] |publisher=[[Associated Newspapers]]}}</ref> In an analysis in early 2007, science writer [[Carl Zimmer]] found evidence that much of what appeared to be inaccurate or inadequate information about science and scientific theory could be traced back to an over-reliance on citations from the works of home-schooling textbook author Jay L.

Conservapedia's article on [[evolution]] presents evolution as a [[scientific theory]] that lacks support and conflicts with evidence in the fossil record that [[Creation science|creationists]] perceive to support creationism.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Brown |first=Barrett |title=Conservapedia: Bastion of the Reality-Denying Right |newspaper=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] |pages= |year=2009 |date=April 23 |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/online/politics/2009/04/conservapedia-bastion-of-the-realitydenying-right.html |postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conservapedia.com/index.php?title=Evolution|title=Evolution|publisher=Conservapedia|date=2010-05-29|accessdate=2010-05-29}}</ref> The entry also suggests that sometimes the [[Bible]] has been more scientifically correct than the scientific community.<ref name="APC">{{cite web |last=Sbarski |first=Peter|title=Wikipedia vs Conservapedia |url=http://apcmag.com/wikipedia_vs_conservapedia.htm |work=APC |date=2007-03-10 |accessdate=2008-06-28}}</ref> Schlafly had defended the statement as presenting an alternative to evolution.<ref name="NPR_conservapedia"/> An entry on the [[Pacific Northwest tree octopus|"Pacific Northwest Arboreal Octopus"]] has received particular attention.

Conservapedia has also received criticism for its articles regarding the [[theory of relativity]], particularly on their entry titled "Counterexamples to relativity", an article that lists examples as to why the theory is incorrect. Attention was drawn to the article by a ''[[Talking Points Memo]]'' posting, in which they reported on Conservapedia's entry and stated that Andy Schlafly, Conservapedia's founder, "has found one more liberal plot: the theory of relativity".<ref name="TPM">{{cite web|last=Carpentier|first=Megan|title=Conservapedia: E=mc<sup>2</sup> Is A Liberal Conspiracy|url=http://tpmmuckraker.talkingpointsmemo.com/2010/08/conservapedia_founder_takes_on_the_notorious_liber.php|work=TPMMuckracker|publisher=Talking Points Memo|accessdate=September 4, 2010|date=August 9, 2010}}</ref> ''[[New Scientist]]'', a science magazine, criticized Conservapedia's views on relativity and responded to several of Conservapedia's arguments against it.<ref name="newscientist">{{cite web|last=Gefter|first=Amanda|last2=Biever|first2=Celeste|title=E=mc<sup>2</sup>?

[[University of Maryland]] physics professor [[Robert L. Park]] has also criticized Conservapedia's entry on the theory of relativity, arguing that its criticism of the principle as being "heavily promoted by liberals who like its encouragement of relativism and its tendency to mislead people in how they view the world" confuses a physical theory with a Christian-conservative moral value.<ref>[[Park, Robert L.]] [http://bobpark.physics.umd.edu/WN10/wn081310.html "Conservapedia: Countering the Liberal Bias of Wikipedia"]. BobPark.org; August 13, 2010.</ref> In a similar statement, ''New Scientist'' stated at the end of their article that:<ref name="newscientist" />{{rp|2}}

{{bquote|In the end there is no liberal conspiracy at work. Unfortunately, humanities scholars often confuse the issue by misusing the term "relativity". The theory in no way encourages relativism, regardless of what Conservapedia may think. The theory of relativity is ultimately not so much about what it renders relative<U+2014>three dimensional space and one-dimensional time<U+2014>but about what it renders absolute: the speed of light and four-dimensional space-time.}}

In October 2010, ''[[Scientific American]]'' criticized Conservapedia's attitude towards the Theory of Relativity, assigning them a zero score on their 0 to 100 fallacy-versus-fact "Science Index", describing Conservapedia as "the online encyclopedia run by conservative lawyer Andrew Schlafly, (which) implies that Einstein's theory of relativity is part of a liberal plot."<ref>Scientific American, [http://www.nature.com/scientificamerican/journal/v303/n4/full/scientificamerican1010-22b.html October 2010, issue, "Science Index", Page 22]</ref> {{See|Criticism of relativity theory}}

=== Political and religious ideology ===
Many Conservapedia articles criticize values that its editors associate with "liberal ideology".  Schlafly said in an interview with [[National Public Radio]] that Wikipedia's article on the history of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] is an "attempt to legitimize the modern Democratic Party by going back to [[Thomas Jefferson]]" and that it is "specious and worth criticizing".<ref name="NPR_conservapedia" /> He also has claimed that Wikipedia is "six times more liberal than the American public", a claim that has been labeled "sensational" by Andrew Chung of the Canadian newspaper the ''[[Toronto Star]]''.<ref name="The Star"/>

John Cotey of the ''[[St. Petersburg Times]]'' observed that the Conservapedia article about the Democratic Party contained a criticism about the party's alleged support for [[same-sex marriage]], and associated the party with the "[[homosexual agenda]]".<ref name="Cotey">{{cite news |last=Cotey |first=John |title=Conservative Web site counters the 'bias' of Wikipedia |url=http://www.seattlepi.com/lifestyle/307867_conservapedia17.html |work=St. Petersburg Times |date=2007-03-16 |accessdate=2008-07-03}}</ref> The Conservapedia entries on Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]] and President [[Barack Obama]] are critical of their respective subjects.<ref name="LA Times"/> During the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 presidential campaign]], its entry on Obama asserted that he "has no clear personal achievement that cannot be explained as the likely result of [[affirmative action]]". Some Conservapedia editors urged that it be changed or deleted, but Schlafly responded by asserting that the ''[[Harvard Law Review]]'', the Harvard University legal journal for which Obama was once an editor and president, uses racial quotas and stated: "The statement about affirmative action is accurate and will remain in the entry".<ref>
{{cite web |last=Schlafly |first=Andrew |title=Talk:Barack Obama |publisher=Conservapedia |date=February 17, 2008 |url=http://www.conservapedia.com/index.php?title=Talk:Barack_Obama/archive1&oldid=470232#removed_false_information |accessdate=2008-03-27}}</ref> In addition, Hugh Muir of the British newspaper ''The Guardian'' mockingly referred to Conservapedia's assertion that Obama has links to radical [[Islam]] as "dynamite" and an excellent resource for "US rightwingers".<ref name="The Guardian">{{cite news |last=Muir |first=Hugh |title=Guardian Diary |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2008/oct/03/2 |date=2007-10-03 |accessdate=2008-11-24 | location=London | work=The Guardian}}</ref> In contrast, the articles about conservative politicians, such as [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] former [[President of the United States|US president]] [[Ronald Reagan]] and former British [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Margaret Thatcher]] have been observed as praising their respective subjects.<ref name="LA Times"/><ref name="CHE3">{{cite journal|author=Read, Brock|date=March 2, 2007|url=http://chronicle.com/blogPost/A-Wikipedia-for-the-Right-Wing/2875/|title=A Wikipedia for the Right Wing|publisher=Chronicle of Higher Education}}</ref> Mark Sabbatini of the ''[[Juneau Empire]]'' considered the Conservapedia entry on [[Sarah Palin]], the Republican vice-presidential candidate for the 2008 US presidential election a "kinder, gentler" and "far shorter and less controversial" reference for one wishing to learn about Palin in contrast with the corresponding Wikipedia entry, which Sabbatini found to be plagued by disputes over inclusion of potentially controversial details about her life.<ref>{{cite news |last=Sabbatini |first=Mark |title=Wikipedia war emerges over details about Palin |url=http://www.juneauempire.com/stories/090208/sta_326628504.shtml |work=The Juneau Empire |date=2008-09-02 |accessdate=2008-09-02}}</ref>

In July 2008, ''[[American Prospect]]'' associate editor [[Ezra Klein]] derided the Conservapedia article on [[atheism]] in his weekly column: "As Daniel DeGroot notes, you've got to wonder which 'unreasonable' explanations they rejected when formulating that entry".<ref>{{cite web |last=Klein |first=Ezra |title=God's Bathroom Floor |url=http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/ezraklein_archive?month=07&year=2008&base_name=gods_bathroom_floor |work=The American Prospect |date=2008-07-28 |accessdate=2008-07-28}}</ref>

Brian Macdonald, a Conservapedia editor, commented vandalism was intended to "cause people to say, 'That Conservapedia is just wacko.'" Macdonald spent many hours daily reverting, in the words of Stephanie Simon of the ''[[LA Times]]'', "malicious editing". Vandals had inserted "errors, [[pornographic]] photos and satire". For example, U.S. Atty. Gen. [[Alberto R. Gonzales]] was said to be "a strong supporter of [[torture]] as a law enforcement tool for use against Democrats and [[third world]] inhabitants".<ref name="LA Times"/>

=== Other editorial policies ===
Conservapedia states on its "Manual of Style" page that "American English spellings are preferred but Commonwealth spellings, for ''[[wikt:de novo|de novo]]'' or otherwise well-maintained articles are welcome". It prefers that articles about the [[United Kingdom]] use British English, while articles about the [[United States]] use American English, to resolve editorial disputes.<ref>{{cite web |title=Spelling |url=http://www.conservapedia.com/index.php?title=Conservapedia:Manual_of_Style&oldid=427988#Spelling |work=Manual of Style |publisher=Conservapedia |date=2008-04-10 |accessdate=2008-04-12}}</ref> Initially, Schlafly<ref name="bbc"/> and other Conservapedia editors<ref name="itwire">{{cite news |last=Turner |first=Adam |title=Conservapedia aims to set Wikipedia right |url=http://www.itwire.com/content/view/10160/1154/|work=IT Wire |date=2007-03-05 |accessdate=2008-05-12}}</ref> considered Wikipedia's policy allowing British English spelling to be anti-American bias.

The "Conservapedia Commandments" also require edits to be "family-friendly, clean, concise, and without gossip or foul language" and that users make most edits on their site quality edits to articles; accounts that engage in what it considers "unproductive activity, such as 90% talk and only 10% quality edits" may be blocked. The commandments also cite the [[United States Code]] as justification for legal action against edits that contain [[Obscene|obscenities]] or are vandalism or [[Spam (electronic)|spam]].<ref name="Conservapedia commandments"/> Conservapedia policies encourage its users to choose usernames "based on [their] real name or initials", and users that have usernames deemed "frivolous" by the admins are blocked;<ref>{{cite web |title=Log in / create account|url=http://www.conservapedia.com/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin|publisher=Conservapedia|accessdate=2010-12-20}}</ref> one of the site's criticisms of Wikipedia is "silly administrator names", which is claimed to reflect Wikipedia's "substantial anti-intellectual element".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conservapedia.com/Conservapedia:Guidelines#Member_Accounts|title=Conservapedia Guidelines: Member accounts|accessdate=2010-05-05|publisher=Conservapedia}}</ref>

== Reception ==
<!-- Creation Wiki not notable under previous afds -->
The Conservapedia project has come under significant criticism for numerous factual inaccuracies<ref name="Clarke"/><ref name="Metro"/> and [[factual relativism]].<ref name="Clarke"/> ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' magazine noted that Conservapedia was "attracting lots of derisive comments on [[blog]]s and a growing number of phony articles written by mischief makers".<ref name="wired" /> Iain Thomson in ''[[Information World Review]]'' wrote that "leftist subversives" may have been creating deliberate parody entries.<ref name="IWR"/> Conservapedia has been compared to CreationWiki, a wiki written from a [[creationism|creationist]] perspective,<ref name="presstelegram"/><ref name="wired" /> and Theopedia, a wiki with a Reformed theology focus.<ref name="Christian Post"/> [[Fox News Channel|Fox News]] obliquely compared it with other new conservative websites competing with mainstream ones, such as [[MyChurch]], a Christian version of social networking site [[MySpace]], and [[GodTube]], a Christian version of video site [[YouTube]].<ref name="GodTube">{{cite news|title=GodTube Provides Christian Web-Video Alternative|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,307446,00.html|work=Fox News|agency=Associated Press|date=2007-11-02|accessdate=2008-08-02}}</ref> ''The Guardian'' of the United Kingdom has referred to the Conservapedia's politics as "[[Right-wing politics|right-wing]]".<ref name="Guardian"/>

[[Thomas Eugene Flanagan]], a conservative professor of political science at the [[University of Calgary]], has argued that Conservapedia is more about religion, specifically Christianity,  than conservatism and that it "is far more guilty of the crime they're attributing to Wikipedia" than Wikipedia itself.<ref name="The Star"/> Matt Millham of the military-oriented newspaper ''[[Stars and Stripes (newspaper)|Stars and Stripes]]'' called Conservapedia "a Web site that caters mostly to evangelical Christians".<ref>{{cite news|last=Millham|first=Matt|title=Faith takes strange forms on the Web|url=http://www.stripes.com/news/faith-takes-strange-forms-on-the-web-1.80022|work=Stars and Stripes|date=2008-06-15|accessdate=2008-06-25}}</ref> Its scope as an encyclopedia, according to its founders, "offers a historical record from a Christian and conservative perspective".<ref name="ECTIMES on Cwiki">{{cite web |first=Tim |last= Gray |url= http://ecommercetimes.com/story/56084.html |title=Conservapedia: Far Righter Than Wikipedia |publisher=ecommercetimes.com |date=2007-04-03|accessdate=2008-06-27}}</ref> [[APC (magazine)|''APC'' magazine]] perceives this to be representative of Conservapedia's own problem with bias.<ref name="APC"/>  Conservative and Christian commentator [[Rod Dreher]] has been highly critical of the website's "Conservative Bible Project", a planned retranslation of the Bible which Dreher attributes to "insane hubris" on the part of "right-wing ideologues".<ref>{{cite web |first=Rod |last=Dreher |url= http://blog.beliefnet.com/crunchycon/2009/10/conservatizing-the-bible.html |title=Conservatizing the Bible |publisher=Beliefnet |date=2009-10-01|accessdate=2009-10-05}}</ref>

The project has also been criticized for promoting a dichotomy between [[conservatism]] and [[liberalism]] and for promoting [[relativism]] with the implicit idea that there "often are two equally valid interpretations of the facts".<ref name="Clarke"/> Matthew Sheffield, columnist for ''[[The Washington Times]]'' and contributor to the conservative [[Media Research Center]] blog ''NewsBusters'', argued that conservatives concerned about bias should contribute more often to Wikipedia rather than use Conservapedia as an alternative since he felt that alternative websites like Conservapedia are often "incomplete".<ref>{{cite web|last=Sheffield|first=Matthew|title=Conservatives miss Wikipedia's threat|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2008/aug/21/conservatives-miss-wikipedias-threat/|work=The Washington Times|date=August 22, 2008|accessdate=April 1, 2010}}</ref> Author Damien Thompson says Conservapedia "is to dress up nonsense as science".<ref name="Thompson 2008">{{cite book| author = Thompson, Damian| title = Counterknowledge: How We Surrendered to Conspiracy Theories, Quack Medicine, Bogus Science and Fake History| publisher = Atlantic Books|year = 2008| isbn = 1843546752}}</ref>

Bryan Ochalla, writing for the [[LGBT]] magazine ''[[The Advocate]]'', referred to the project as "Wikipedia for the bigoted".<ref>Bryan Ochalla, [http://www.bryanochalla.com/articles/article.aspx?article_id=135 "Wikipedia for the bigoted".] ''The Advocate'', March 25, 2008, p. 12.</ref> On the satirical news program ''[[The Daily Show]]'', comedian [[Lewis Black]] lampooned its article on [[homosexuality]].<ref>{{cite episode|title=Episode 12087|url= http://www.thedailyshow.com/video/index.jhtml?videoId=89307&title=new-media |series=The Daily Show| network=Comedy Central|airdate=2007-06-27}} Black highlighted Conservapedia's [http://www.conservapedia.com/index.php?title=Homosexuality&oldid=188063 introductory sentence] "homosexuality is an immoral sexual lifestyle". In response, he said: "On Conservapedia, 'gay' sounds way more interesting!"</ref> Writing in ''[[The Australian]]'', columnist Emma Jane described Conservapedia as "a disturbing parallel universe where the ice age is a theoretical period, intelligent design is empirically testable, and relativity and geology are junk sciences." <ref>{{cite web|last=Jane|first=Emma|title=A parallel online universe |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/opinion/a-parallel-online-universe/story-e6frg6zo-1225983259863|work=The Australian|date=January 8, 2011|accessdate=January 9, 2011}}</ref>

Opinions criticizing the site rapidly spread throughout the [[blogosphere]] around early 2007.<ref name="wired"/><ref name="sickopedia"/> Schlafly appeared on radio programs ''[[Today programme|Today]]'' on BBC Radio 4<ref name="bbc"/> and ''[[All Things Considered]]'' on [[NPR]]<ref name="NPR_conservapedia"/> to discuss the site around that time. In May 2008, Schlafly and one of his homeschooled students appeared on the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] program ''[[The Hour (Canadian TV series)|The Hour]]'' for the same purpose.<ref>{{cite video|title=Conservapedia on The Hour|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvT5YuDovHI|publisher=YouTube|date=2008-05-21|people=Andrew Schlafly}}</ref>

Stephanie Simon of the ''Los Angeles Times'' quoted two Conservapedia editors who commented favorably about Conservapedia.<ref name="LA Times"/> Matt Barber, policy director for the conservative Christian political action group [[Concerned Women for America]], praised Conservapedia as a more family-friendly and accurate alternative to Wikipedia.<ref>{{cite web|last=Barber|first=Matt|title=Conservapedia: The Conservative Alternative |url=http://www.cwfa.org/articles/15240/CFI/misc/index.htm|publisher=Concerned Women for America |date=2008-05-23 |accessdate=2008-09-13 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080527205123/http://www.cwfa.org/articles/15240/CFI/misc/index.htm |archivedate=2008-05-27}}</ref>

''[[Wired Magazine]]'', in an article entitled "Ten Impressive, Weird And Amazing Facts About Wikipedia," highlighted several of Conservapedia's articles, including those on "Atheism and obesity," "Hollywood values", amongst others. It also highlighted Conservapedia's "Examples of bias in Wikipedia" article, which encourages readers to contact Jimmy Wales and tell him to "sort it out."<ref>{{cite web|last=Abell|first=John C|title=Ten Impressive, Weird And Amazing Facts About Wikipedia |url=http://www.wired.com/epicenter/2011/01/ten-facts-about-wikipedia/2/|publisher=Wired |date=2011-01-12 |accessdate=2011-01-13}}</ref>

Conservapedia's use of Wikipedia's format to try and create a conservative and fundamentalist Christian alternative encyclopedia, has been mirrored by other sites, such as Tangle.com (formerly GodTube), QubeTV and MyChurch, which adopted the format of the more prominent Facebook, Youtube and MySpace, respectively.<ref name="presstelegram"/><ref name="GodTube"/><ref name="computing">{{cite web |url=http://www.computing.co.uk/vnunet/news/2188871/christians-launch-godtube-com |title=Christians take on YouTube with GodTube |accessdate=2010-03-26 |last=Thomson |first=Iain |date=2007-04-30|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070902110130/http://www.computing.co.uk/vnunet/news/2188871/christians-launch-godtube-com |archivedate = September 2, 2007|deadurl=yes}}</ref>

=== Jimmy Wales ===
Wikipedia's co-creator [[Jimmy Wales]] said about Conservapedia that "free culture knows no bounds" and "the reuse of our work to build variants [is] directly in line with our mission".<ref name="Biever">{{cite web |last=Biever |first=Celeste  |url=http://www.newscientist.com/blog/technology/2007/02/conservative-rival-for-wikipedia.html | title = A conservative rival for Wikipedia? | publisher = New Scientist |date = 2007-02-26}}</ref> Wales denied Schlafly's claims of liberal bias in Wikipedia.<ref name="The Star"/>

=== RationalWiki ===
In April 2007, Peter Lipson, a doctor of [[internal medicine]], repeatedly attempted to edit Conservapedia's article on breast cancer to include evidence arguing against Conservapedia's claim that abortion was a major cause of the disease. Conservapedia administrators "questioned his credentials and shut off debate".<ref name="LA Times">{{cite news|last=Simon|first=Stephanie|title=A conservative's answer to Wikipedia|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/jun/19/nation/na-schlafly19|accessdate=2007-11-02|date=2007-06-22|work=Los Angeles Times}}</ref>{{rp|3}} Several editors whose accounts were blocked by Conservapedia administrators, including Lipson, started another website, RationalWiki,<ref>See [http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Main_Page RationalWiki] Web site</ref> to analyze and refute "pseudoscience", the "[[anti-science]] movement", and "crank ideas", as well as conduct "explorations of [[authoritarianism]] and [[fundamentalism]]" and explore "how these subjects are handled in the [[Mass media|media]]."<ref>{{cite web|title = About|publisher = RationalWiki|date = 19 September 2010|url = http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Template:RationalWiki_MainPage/About|accessdate = 16 October 2010}}</ref>

According to an article published in the ''Los Angeles Times'' in 2007, "From there, RationalWiki members monitor Conservapedia, particularly on the page "Conservapedia:What is going on at CP?", and<U+2014>by their own admission<U+2014>engage in acts of cyber-vandalism".<ref name="LA Times"/>{{rp|3}} RationalWiki members and others have inserted vandalism edits into Conservapedia; such edits have introduced errors, pornographic images, and satire.<ref name="LA Times"/>{{rp|4}}

=== Lenski dialogue ===
{{wikisource|Lenski dialog}}
On June 9, 2008, ''[[New Scientist]]'' published an article describing [[Richard Lenski]]'s [[E. coli long-term evolution experiment|20-year ''E. coli'' experiment]], which reported that the bacteria evolved the ability to metabolize citrate.<ref name="newscientist evolution research">{{cite web |first=Bob |last= Holmes |url=http://www.newscientist.com/channel/life/dn14094-bacteria-make-major-evolutionary-shift-in-the-lab.html |title=Bacteria makes major evolutionary shift in the lab |publisher=New Scientist |date=2008-06-09|accessdate=2008-06-27}}</ref> Schlafly contacted Lenski to request the data. Lenski explained that the relevant data was in the paper and that Schlafly fundamentally misunderstood it. Schlafly wrote again and requested the raw data. Lenski replied again that the relevant data was already in the paper, that the "raw data" were living bacterial samples, which he would willingly share with qualified researchers at properly equipped biology labs, and that he felt insulted by letters and comments on Conservapedia which he saw as brusque and offensive, including claims of outright deceit.<ref>{{cite web |first=Michael |last=Marshall |url= http://www.newscientist.com/blog/shortsharpscience/2008/06/creationist-critics-get-their.html?DCMP=ILC-rhts&nsref=ts11_bar  |title=Creationist critics get their comeuppance |publisher=newscientist |date=2008-06-25 |accessdate=2008-06-27}}</ref> The Daily Telegraph later called Lenski's reply "one of the greatest and most comprehensive put-downs in scientific argument". <ref>{{cite web |first=Tom |last=Chivers |url= http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/6408927/Internet-rules-and-laws-the-top-10-from-Godwin-to-Poe.html  |title=Internet rules and laws: the top 10, from Godwin to Poe |publisher=telegraph |date=2009-10-23 |accessdate=2011-01-27}}</ref>

Carl Zimmer wrote that it was readily apparent that "Schlafly had not bothered to read [Lenski's paper] closely",<ref>{{cite web |first=Carl |last=Zimmer |url=http://scienceblogs.com/loom/2008/06/24/of_bacteria_and_throw_pillows_3.php

The dialogue between Lenski and Conservapedia is noted in [[Richard Dawkins]]' ''[[The Greatest Show on Earth: The Evidence for Evolution]]'' in a chapter concerning Lenski's research.<ref>Chapter 5: "Before our very eyes (examples of evolution observed)"</ref>

== Conservative Bible Project ==
Conservapedia hosts the "Conservative Bible Project", a project aiming to rewrite the English translation of the Bible in order to remove terms described as "liberal bias".<ref name="Politics Daily">{{cite news |title=A Neocon Bible: What Would Jesus Say? |first=David |last=Gibson  |url=http://www.politicsdaily.com/2009/10/07/a-neocon-bible-what-would-jesus-say/ |publisher=Politics Daily  |date=7 October 2009 |accessdate=7 October 2009}}</ref>  The project intends to remove sections of the Bible which are judged by Conservapedia's founder to be later liberal additions.<ref name="Evangelical Textual Criticism">{{cite news |title=Conservapedia Bible Project&nbsp;<U+2014> Free of Corruption by Liberal Untruths? |first=Tommy |last=Wasserman  |url=http://evangelicaltextualcriticism.blogspot.com/2009/10/conservapedia-bible-project-free-of.html  |date=19 October 2009 |accessdate=19 October 2009}}</ref> These include the [[Jesus and the woman taken in adultery|story of the adulteress]] in the [[Gospel of John]] in which Jesus declares "Let him who is without sin cast the first stone".<ref name="Politics Daily"/> The project also intends to remove Jesus's prayer on the cross, "Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing", since it appears only in the [[Gospel of Luke]] and since, according to Schlafly, "the simple fact is that some of the persecutors of Jesus did know what they were doing. This quotation is a favorite of liberals but should not appear in a conservative Bible".<ref name="Politics Daily"/> The adulteress story and the "forgive them" line are missing from many early manuscripts, and many modern textual scholars consider that they are not authentic parts of the gospels, though possibly historically valid.<ref>{{cite web | title = NETBible: John 7 | publisher = Bible.org | url = http://net.bible.org/bible.php?book=Joh&chapter=7#n139 | accessdate = 2009-10-17}}  See note 139 on that page.
