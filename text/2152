'''Culinary diplomacy''', also known as '''gastrodiplomacy''', is a type of [[cultural diplomacy]], which itself is a subset of [[public diplomacy]]. Its basic premise is that "the easiest way to win hearts and minds is through the stomach."<ref name="Rockower 1">Rockower, Paul S.

== Background and Definitions ==

The terms "culinary diplomacy" and "gastrodiplomacy" have been in use since the early 2000s, and have been popularized by the work of public diplomacy scholars [[Paul Rockower]] and [[Sam Chapple-Sokol]]. An early mention of the concept was in a 2002 [[The Economist|Economist]] article about the ''Thai Kitchen of the World'' program.<ref name="Thailand : Kitchen of the World">{{cite web|url=http://thailand.prd.go.th/ebook/kitchen/ |title=Thailand : Kitchen of the World |publisher=Thailand.prd.go.th |date= |accessdate=2013-07-02}}</ref><ref>"Thailand's Gastro-Diplomacy" http://www.economist.com/node/999687</ref> In a 2011 article published in the Taiwanese journal ''Issues & Studies'', Rockower wrote that "Gastrodiplomacy is predicated on the notion that the easiest way to win hearts and minds is through the stomach."<ref name="Rockower 1" /> Chapple-Sokol wrote in a 2013 article in the journal ''The Hague Journal of Diplomacy'' that culinary diplomacy is "the use of food and cuisine as an instrument to create cross-cultural understanding in the hopes of improving interactions and cooperation."<ref name="Chapple-Sokol" />

=== Culinary Diplomacy versus Gastrodiplomacy ===

The two terms "culinary diplomacy" and "gastrodiplomacy" are used interchangeably by many, though some scholars have differentiated the terms. Rockower, for example, claims that gastrodiplomacy refers to a tool of public diplomacy, while culinary diplomacy serves as "a means to further diplomatic protocol through cuisine."<ref name="Rockower 2">Rockower, Paul S. [http://www.palgrave-journals.com/pb/journal/v8/n3/abs/pb201217a.html "Recipes for Gastrodiplomacy."] ''Place Branding and Public Diplomacy'' Volume 8 (2012): 235-346.</ref>  Chapple-Sokol writes that both of these fall under the broad categorization of "culinary diplomacy," and differentiates between ''public'' and ''private'' culinary diplomacy.<ref name="Chapple-Sokol" /> The former refers to culinary diplomacy being used as a tool of public diplomacy, and more specifically cultural diplomacy, while the latter "occurs behind closed doors," akin to Rockower's definition.

== Examples of Culinary Diplomacy Programs ==

=== Thailand ===

The Global Thai program, launched in 2002, was the first government-led culinary diplomacy initiative.<ref>[http://www.economist.com/node/999687 The Economist]</ref> Its intention was to build the number of Thai restaurants worldwide; according to the Thai government, the number went from 5,500 in 2002 to more than 10,000 in 2013, as well as to encourage more people worldwide to eat [[Thai cuisine]].<ref>[http://thailand.prd.go.th/view_news.php?id=5585&a=2 Thai Government Public Relations Department]</ref>

That program was followed by ''Thailand: Kitchen of the World'', an eBook published to promote the program states the following:
<blockquote>
''Thai food and [[Thai cuisine]] from the past to the present are distinctive in their charms and characters. The cuisine is a proud heritage of the [[Thai people]] that they believe is second to none, and it has been handed down through generations. Apart from the delicate blend of tastes and the rich nutritional value, the elaborate arrangement of Thai food and the decorations with [[fruit]] and [[vegetable]] carvings make it all the more inviting. At the same time, Thai food and Thai cooking reflect the wisdom and culture of the Thai nation. Today, Thai food and Thai cuisine stand ready to make Thailand a proud Kitchen of the World.''<ref name="Thailand : Kitchen of the World"/>
</blockquote>

=== South Korea ===

[[South Korea]] launched its own culinary diplomacy program in 2009, a $77m investment entitled "Korean Cuisine to the World or "Global ''Hansik''".<ref name="Pham">Pham, Mary Jo A. [http://thediplomatist.com/2013/01/25/food-as-communication-a-case-study-of-south-koreas-gastrodiplomacy/ "Food as Communication: A Case Study of South Korea's Gastrodiplomacy."] ''Journal of International Service'' Volume 22, Number 1 (Spring 2013): 1-22.</ref> The goals of the program, run by the Ministry of Food, Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, are to promote the unique nature and health qualities of [[Korean cuisine]] (''hansik''), as well as to increase the number of Korean restaurants worldwide to 40,000 by 2017.<ref>"Global Hansik off to strong start" [http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/biz/2009/05/123_42711.html ''The Korea Times'']</ref> Projects undertaken by the Korean government include the opening of a [[kimchi]] institute, working to establish Korean cuisine as a course in internationally-recognized cooking schools, and the launch of a touring Korean [[food truck]].<ref name="Pham"/>

=== Malaysia ===

In 2010, [[Malaysia]] undertook a similar project and launched the "Malaysian Kitchen for the World." <ref>"'Malaysia Kitchen for the World 2010' Campaign Launched to Promote Malaysian Restaurants and Cuisine in the New York Metro Area" [http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/malaysia-kitchen-for-the-world-2010-campaign-launched-to-promote-malaysian-restaurants-and-cuisine-in-the-new-york-metro-area-87148567.html ''PRNewswire'']</ref> The program, carried out by the Malaysia External Trade Development Corporation, has focused most of its efforts to promote Malaysian cuisine in the United States and United Kingdom.<ref name="Rockower 2"/> Malaysia is an especially appropriate country to conduct culinary diplomacy due to its history as a culinary crossroads and its current mix of [[Malay]], [[Chinese people|Chinese]], and [[Indian people|Indian]] populations.

=== Peru ===

An official [[Peru]]vian culinary diplomacy program started in 2011, with Peru's application for its cuisine to be included in [[UNESCO]]'s list of [[intangible cultural heritage]] like its neighbor [[Mexico]].<ref>Wilson, Rachel. [http://www.exchangediplomacy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/2.-Rachel-Wilson_Cocina-Peruana-Para-El-Mundo-Gastrodiplomacy-the-Culinary-Nation-Brand-and-the-Context-of-National-Cuisine-in-Peru.pdf "Cocina Peruana Para El Mundo: Gastrodiplomacy, the Culinary Nation Brand, and the Context of National Cuisine in Peru."]</ref> The ''Cocina Peruana Para El Mundo'' campaign has also been promoted by Peruvian chef [[Gaston Acurio]], the owner of multiple restaurants worldwide as well as a co-creator of the documentary ''Per<U+00FA> Sabe'', along with [[Spain|Spanish]] chef [[Ferran Adri<U+00E0>]].<ref>{{cite web|author=<!-- Breadcrumb NavXT 4.1.0 --> Inicio &gt; The Documentary |url=http://www.perusabe.com.pe/en/el-documental/ |title=The Documentary |publisher=Peru Sabe |date= |accessdate=2013-07-02}}</ref>

=== The United States ===

In September 2012, the United States officially launched its Culinary Diplomacy Partnership Initiative.<ref>[http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2012/09/197375.htm U.S. Department of State to Launch Diplomatic Culinary Partnership]</ref> More than 80 chefs, including White House Executive Chef [[Cristeta Comerford]], White House Executive Pastry Chef [[William Yosses]], and Spanish-born chef [[Jos<U+00E9> Andr<U+00E9>s]], were named to be members of the "American Chef Corps." The initiative is organized by the [[United States State Department]] Office of Protocol. One goal of the program is to send members of the Chef Corps to American embassies abroad on [[public diplomacy]] missions to teach about [[Cuisine of the United States|American cuisine]].
