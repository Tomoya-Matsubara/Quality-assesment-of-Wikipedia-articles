Born in Wales to Norwegian parents, Dahl served in the [[Royal Air Force]] during [[World War II]], in which he became a [[flying ace]] and intelligence officer, rising to the rank of Acting [[Wing Commander (rank)|wing commander]]. He rose to prominence in the 1940s with works for both children and adults and became one of the world's best-selling authors.<ref name=INT/><ref name=BDC/> He has been referred to as "one of the greatest storytellers for children of the 20th century".<ref name=IND/> Among his awards for contribution to literature, he received the [[World Fantasy Award for Life Achievement]] in 1983, and Children's Author of the Year from the [[Specsavers National Book Awards|British Book Awards]] in 1990. In 2008 ''[[The Times]]'' placed Dahl 16th on its list of "The 50 greatest [[British literature|British writers]] since 1945".<ref name=TIM>[http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/article3127837.ece The 50 greatest British writers since 1945]. ''[[The Times]]''. 5 January 2008. Retrieved on 1 February 2010.</ref> 

Dahl's short stories are known for their unexpected endings and his children's books for their unsentimental, often very [[black comedy|dark humour]]. His works include ''[[James and the Giant Peach]]'', ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]'', ''[[Matilda (novel)|Matilda]]'', ''[[The Witches (book)|The Witches]]'', ''[[Fantastic Mr Fox]]'', ''[[The Twits]]'', ''[[George's Marvellous Medicine]]'' and ''[[The BFG]]''.

==Early life==

Roald Dahl was born at Villa Marie, Fairwater Road in [[Llandaff]], [[Cardiff]], Wales, in 1916, to Norwegian parents, Harald Dahl and Sofie Magdalene Dahl (''n<U+00E9>e'' Hesselberg).<ref>Philip Howard, "Dahl, Roald (1916<U+2013>1990)", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004</ref> Dahl's father had emigrated to the UK from [[Sarpsborg]], Norway, and settled in Cardiff in the 1880s. His mother came over and married his father in 1911. Dahl was named after the [[polar explorer]] [[Roald Amundsen]], a national hero in Norway at the time. He spoke Norwegian at home with his parents and his sisters Astri, Alfhild and Else. Dahl and his sisters were baptised at the [[Norwegian Church, Cardiff]], where their parents worshipped.<ref>Colin Palfrey (2006) [http://books.google.com/books?id=pOfJeCs0cDIC&pg=PA76&dq=ROALD+DAHL+BAPTISED+Norwegian+Church&hl=en&ei=uRINTZLKKNG4hAfvt9i3Dg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CDkQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=ROALD%20DAHL%20BAPTISED%20Norwegian%20Church&f=false Cardiff Soul: An Underground Guide to the City]</ref>

In 1920, when Dahl was three years old, his seven-year-old sister, Astri, died from [[appendicitis]]. Weeks later, his father died of [[pneumonia]] at the age of 57 while on a fishing trip in the Antarctic. With the option of returning to Norway to live with relatives, Dahl's mother decided to remain in Wales because Harald had wished to have their children educated in British schools, which he considered the world's best.<ref>Jill C. Wheeler (2006) ''Roald Dahl'' p.9. ABDO Publishing Company, 2006</ref>

Dahl first attended [[The Cathedral School, Llandaff]]. At the age of eight, he and four of his friends (one named Thwaites) were [[Corporal punishment|caned]] by the headmaster after putting a dead mouse in a jar of gobstoppers at the local sweet shop,<ref name=IND/> which was owned by a "mean and loathsome" old woman called Mrs Pratchett.<ref name=IND/> This was known among the five boys as the "[[Boy (book)#Great mouse plot of 1924|Great Mouse Plot of 1924]]".<ref>Michael D. Sharp (2006) [http://books.google.com/books?id=8d-nHl6bZtgC&pg=PA516&dq=roald+dahl+great+mouse+plot&hl=en&ei=PYwiTdLLHsOChQeNsKG4Dg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CDsQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=roald%20dahl%20great%20mouse%20plot&f=false Popular Contemporary Writers] p.516. Marshall Cavendish, 2006</ref>

Thereafter, he transferred to a [[boarding school]] in England: St Peter's in [[Weston-super-Mare]]. Roald's parents had wanted him to be educated at an English [[Independent school (United Kingdom)|public school]] and, because of a then regular ferry link across the [[Bristol Channel]], this proved to be the nearest. His time at St Peter's was an unpleasant experience for him. He was very homesick and wrote to his mother every week but never revealed to her his unhappiness, being under the pressure of school censorship. Only after her death in 1967 did he find out that she had saved every single one of his letters, in small bundles held together with green tape.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/arts/sites/roald-dahl/pages/media-2000-school.shtml | title= Roald Dahl's School Days | publisher=BBC Wales | accessdate=24 January 2010}}</ref> Dahl wrote about his time at St Peter's in his autobiography ''[[Boy (book)|Boy: Tales of Childhood]]''.<ref>{{Cite book| title= [[Boy (book)|Boy: Tales of Childhood]] | first= Roald | last= Dahl | publisher=Puffin Books| year= 1984 | isbn= 978-0-14-130305-5}}</ref>

From 1929, he attended [[Repton School]] in [[Derbyshire]], where, according to ''Boy: Tales of Childhood'', a friend named Michael was viciously caned by headmaster [[Geoffrey Fisher]], who later became the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] and went on [[Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II|to crown]] [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] in 1953. (However, according to Dahl's biographer [[Jeremy Treglown]],<ref>Jeremy Treglown, ''Roald Dahl: A Biography'' (1994) , Faber and Faber, page 21. Treglown's source note is as follows: "Several people who were at the top of Priory House at the time have discussed it with me, particularly B.L.L. Reuss and John Bradburn."</ref> the caning took place in May 1933, a year after Fisher had left Repton and the headmaster concerned was in fact [[John Traill Christie|J. T. Christie]], Fisher's successor.) This caused Dahl to "have doubts about religion and even about God".<ref name="boy">{{Cite book|title=[[Boy (book)|Boy: Tales of Childhood]] |last=Dahl |first=Roald |year=1984 |publisher=[[Jonathan Cape]]}}</ref> He was never seen as a particularly talented writer in his school years, with one of his English teachers writing in his school report "I have never met anybody who so persistently writes words meaning the exact opposite of what is intended."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/rdahl.htm |title=Roald Dahl |publisher=Kirjasto.sci.fi |date=23 November 1990 |accessdate=28 January 2011}}</ref> Dahl was exceptionally tall, reaching {{height|ft=6|in=6}} in adult life.<ref>[http://www.penguin.co.uk/nf/Author/AuthorPage/0,,1000008184,00.html Roald Dahl&nbsp;<U+2013> Penguin UK Authors]&nbsp;<U+2013> Penguin UK<!-- Bot generated title --></ref> He excelled at sports, being made captain of the school [[fives]] and [[Squash (sport)|squash]] teams, and also playing for the [[Association football|football]] team.<ref>Shavick, Andrea (1997) [http://books.google.com/books?id=DovoRMkvxjUC&pg=PA12&dq=roald+dahl+at+school+-+football+team&hl=en&ei=4Av5TfzHIoa48gODmbHRCw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10&ved=0CF4Q6AEwCQ#v=onepage&q&f=false Roald Dahl: the champion storyteller] p.12.

During his years at Repton, [[Cadbury plc|Cadbury]], the chocolate company, would occasionally send boxes of new chocolates to the school to be tested by the pupils. Dahl apparently used to dream of inventing a new chocolate bar that would win the praise of Mr Cadbury himself; and this proved the inspiration for him to write his third book for children, ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]'' (1964), and to include references to chocolate in other books for children.<ref name=DahlChocolate>{{Cite book|year=2005|author=Roald Dahl (derivative work) and [[Quentin Blake]]|isbn=0-14-131959-3|title=Roald Dahl's Incredible Chocolate Box}}</ref>

Throughout his childhood and adolescent years, Dahl spent the majority of his summer holidays with his mother's family in Norway, and wrote about many happy memories from those expeditions in ''Boy: Tales of Childhood'', such as when he replaced the tobacco in his half<U+2013>sister's fianc<U+00E9>'s pipe with goat droppings.<ref>''Boy and Going Solo'', p.128 - p.132</ref> He only experienced one unhappy memory of his holidays in Norway at around the age of eight, when his [[adenoid]]s were removed by a doctor.<ref>''Boy and Going Solo'', p.68 - 71</ref> His childhood and first job selling kerosene in [[Midsomer Norton]] and surrounding villages in [[Somerset]], [[South West England]] are subjects in ''Boy: Tales of Childhood''.<ref>Dahl, Roald (1984) ''Boy: tales of childhood'' p.172.

After finishing his schooling, in August 1934 Dahl crossed the Atlantic on the {{RMS|Nova Scotia|1926|6}} and hiked through [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] with the [[BSES Expeditions|Public Schools Exploring Society]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Sturrock |first=Donald |year=2010 |title=Storyteller: The Authorised Biography of Roald Dahl |location=London |publisher=[[HarperCollins|HarperPress]] |isbn=0007254768 |pages=93<U+2013>94 |ref=harv}}</ref><ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/149746/Roald-Dahl Roald Dahl (British author)] ''[[Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica]]'.' Retrieved 4 January 2010.</ref> In July 1934, Dahl joined the [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell Petroleum]] Company. Following two years of training in the United Kingdom, he was transferred to first [[Mombasa]], Kenya, then to [[Dar-es-Salaam]], [[Tanganyika]] (now Tanzania). Along with the only two other Shell employees in the entire territory, he lived in luxury in the Shell House outside Dar-es-Salaam, with a cook and personal servants. While out on assignments supplying oil to customers across Tanganyika, he encountered [[black mamba]]s and lions, among other wildlife.<ref name="boy" />

==Fighter ace==

In August 1939, as World War II loomed, plans were made to round up the hundreds of Germans in [[Dar-es-Salaam]]. Dahl was made a [[lieutenant]] in the [[King's African Rifles]], commanding a platoon of [[Askari]]s, indigenous troops serving in the colonial army.<ref>Donald Sturrock [http://books.google.com/books?id=udN6caZEJesC&pg=PA116&dq=roald+Dahl+-+King's+African+Rifle&hl=en&ei=7RMNTazoEIqEhQfuk8S3Dg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CD8Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q&f=false Storyteller: The Authorized Biography of Roald Dahl] p.116. Simon and Schuster, 2010</ref>

In November 1939, Dahl joined the [[Royal Air Force]] as an [[aircraftman]]. After a {{convert|600|mi|km|sing=on}} car journey from Dar-es-Salaam to [[Nairobi]], he was accepted for flight training with 16 other men, of whom only three others survived the war. With seven hours and 40 minutes experience in a [[De Havilland Tiger Moth]], he flew solo;<ref>Sturrock (2010: 120)</ref> Dahl enjoyed watching the wildlife of [[Kenya]] during his flights. He continued to advanced flying training in Iraq, at [[RAF Habbaniya]], {{convert|50|mi|km}} west of [[Baghdad]]. He was promoted to [[leading aircraftman]] on 24 August 1940.<ref>[http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/34964/pages/5907 The London Gazette, 8 October 1940]''</ref> Following six months' training on [[Hawker Hart]]s, Dahl was made an [[acting pilot officer]].

He was assigned to [[No. 80 Squadron RAF]], flying obsolete [[Gloster Gladiator]]s, the last [[biplane]] [[fighter aircraft]] used by the RAF. Dahl was surprised to find that he would not receive any specialised training in [[aerial combat]], or in flying Gladiators. On 19 September 1940, Dahl was ordered to fly his Gladiator from Abu Sueir in [[Egypt]], on to Amiriya to refuel, and again to Fouka in [[Libya]] for a second refuelling. From there he would fly to 80 Squadron's forward [[airstrip]] {{convert|30|mi|km}} south of [[Mersa Matruh]]. On the final leg, he could not find the airstrip and, running low on [[fuel]] and with night approaching, he was forced to attempt a [[Accidents and incidents in aviation#Causes|landing]] in the desert.<ref>[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/7934421/Roald-Dahl-the-plane-crash-that-gave-birth-to-a-writer.html Roald Dahl: the plane crash that gave birth to a writer] The Telegraph.

Starmont House, 1988</ref> He managed to drag himself away from the blazing wreckage and passed out. Later, he wrote about the crash in his first published work.<ref name=WRN/>

Dahl was rescued and taken to a [[first aid|first-aid]] post in Mersa Matruh, where he regained consciousness, but not his sight, and was then taken by train to the Royal Navy hospital in [[Alexandria]]. There he fell in and out of love with a nurse, Mary Welland. An RAF inquiry into the crash revealed that the location to which he had been told to fly was completely wrong, and he had mistakenly been sent instead to the [[no man's land]] between the Allied and Italian forces.<ref name="solo">{{Cite book|title=[[Going Solo]] |last=Dahl |first=Roald |year=1986 |publisher=Jonathan Cape}}</ref>

In February 1941, Dahl was discharged from hospital and passed fully fit for flying duties. By this time, 80 Squadron had been transferred to the [[Battle of Greece|Greek campaign]] and based at [[Eleusina]], near [[Athens]]. The squadron was now equipped with [[Hawker Hurricane]]s. Dahl flew a replacement Hurricane across the Mediterranean Sea in April 1941, after seven hours flying Hurricanes. By this stage in the Greek campaign, the RAF had only 18 combat aircraft in Greece: 14 Hurricanes and four [[Bristol Blenheim]] light bombers. Dahl saw his first aerial combat on 15 April 1941, while flying alone over the city of [[Chalcis]]. He attacked six [[Junkers Ju-88]]s that were bombing ships and shot one down. On 16 April in another air battle, he shot down another Ju-88.<ref>Andrew Thomas [http://books.google.com/books?id=4u-QXw2bjwUC&pg=PA36&dq=roald+dahl+-+16+April+Ju-88&hl=en&ei=BOQQTY7-KYOWhQeUl424Dg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CDoQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q&f=false Hurricane Aces 1941<U+2013>45] Osprey Publishing, 2003</ref>

On 20 April 1941, Dahl took part in the "[[Battle of Athens (1941)|Battle of Athens]]", alongside the highest-scoring British Commonwealth ace of World War II, [[Marmaduke Pattle|Pat Pattle]] and Dahl's friend [[David Coke]]. Of 12 Hurricanes involved, five were shot down and four of their pilots killed, including Pattle. Greek observers on the ground counted 22 German aircraft downed, but because of the confusion of the aerial engagement, none of the pilots knew which aircraft they had shot down. Dahl described it as ''"an endless blur of enemy fighters whizzing towards me from every side".''<ref>Roald Dahl [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=weZxpJUHuPUC&q=an+endless+blur+of+enemy+fighters+whizzing+towards+me+from+every&dq=an+endless+blur+of+enemy+fighters+whizzing+towards+me+from+every&hl=en&ei=FYUHTbzIDoSYhQfI5azuBw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CDAQ6AEwAg ''Going Solo''] p.151.

In May, as the Germans were pressing on Athens, Dahl was evacuated to Egypt. His squadron was reassembled in [[Haifa]]. From there, Dahl flew sorties every day for a period of four weeks, shooting down a [[Vichy French Air Force]] [[Potez 63]] on 8 June and another Ju-88 on 15 June, but he then began to get severe headaches that caused him to [[G-LOC|black out]]. He was invalided home to Britain. Though at this time Dahl was only a Pilot Officer on probation, in September 1941 he was simultaneously confirmed as a [[Pilot Officer]] and promoted to war substantive [[Flying Officer]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/35292/pages/5664 |title=Viewing Page 5664 of Issue 35292 |publisher=London-gazette.co.uk |date=30 September 1941 |accessdate=28 January 2011}}</ref>

==Diplomat, writer and intelligence officer==
After being invalided home, Dahl was posted to an RAF training camp in Uxbridge while attempting to recover his health enough to become an instructor.<ref>Sturrock (2010: 163)</ref> In late March 1942, while in London, he met the [[Under-Secretary of State for Air]], Major Harold Balfour (later [[Harold Balfour, 1st Baron Balfour of Inchrye|Lord Balfour]]), at his club. Impressed by his war record and conversational abilities, Balfour appointed Dahl as assistant air attach<U+00E9> at the [[British Embassy]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]. Initially resistant, he was finally persuaded by Balfour to accept, and took passage on the SS ''Batori'' from Glasgow a few days later. He arrived in Halifax on 14 April, after which he took a sleeper train to Montreal. Coming from war-starved Britain, Dahl was amazed by the wealth of food and amenities to be had in North America.<ref>Sturrock (2010: 163-165)</ref> Arriving in Washington a week later, Dahl found he liked the atmosphere of the U.S. capital, but was unimpressed by his office in the British Air Mission, attached to the embassy. Nor was he impressed by the ambassador, [[Lord Halifax]], whom he sometimes played tennis with and described as "a courtly English gentleman." As part of his duties as assistant air attach<U+00E9>, Dahl was to help neutralise the isolationist views many Americans still held by giving pro-British speeches and discussing his war service; the US had only entered the war the previous December, following the attack on Pearl Harbor. After only ten days in his new posting, Dahl strongly disliked it, feeling he had taken on "a most ungodly unimportant job."<ref>Sturrock (2010: 166-167)</ref> As he later said:

"''I'd just come from the war. People were getting killed. I had been flying around, seeing horrible things. Now, almost instantly, I found myself in the middle of a pre-war cocktail party in America.''"<ref>Sturrock (2010: 167)</ref>

However, at this time Dahl met the noted novelist [[C. S. Forester]], who was also working to aid the British war effort. ''The Saturday Evening Post'' had asked Forester to write a story based on Dahl's flying experiences; Forester asked Dahl to write down some RAF anecdotes so that he could shape them into a story. After Forester read what Dahl had given him, he decided to publish the story exactly as Dahl had written it. The original title of the article was "A Piece of Cake" but the title was changed to "Shot Down Over Libya" to make it sound more dramatic, despite the fact that Dahl had not actually been shot down; it appeared in the 1 August issue of the ''Post''. He shared a house at 1610 34th Street, NW, in [[Georgetown (Washington, D.C.)|Georgetown]], with another attach<U+00E9>. Dahl socialized with Texas publisher and oilman Charles E. Marsh at his house at 2136 R Street, NW, and the Marsh country estate in Virginia.<!-- Also at this time he joined the [[British Security Coordination]], that covertly sought to influence U.S. policy to favor Great Britain. --><ref name="solo" /><ref name=Dietsch_2013>{{cite news

During the war, Dahl supplied intelligence from Washington to Stephenson and his organisation known as [[British Security Coordination]],<ref name=Dietsch_2013/> which was part of [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]]. He was revealed in the 1980s to have been serving to help promote Britain's interests and message in the United States and to combat the "[[America First Committee|America First]]" movement, working with such other well-known officers as [[Ian Fleming]] and [[David Ogilvy (businessman)|David Ogilvy]].<ref name="The Irreg">The book "''The Irregulars''" (by [[Jennet Conant]], Simon and Schuster 2008) describes this era of Dahl's life and those with whom he worked.</ref> Dahl was once sent back to Britain by British Embassy officials, supposedly for misconduct&nbsp;<U+2013> "I got booted out by the big boys," he said.

===Children's fiction===

Dahl's children's works are usually told from the point of view of a child. They typically involve adult [[villain]]s who hate and mistreat children, and feature at least one "good" adult to counteract the villain(s). These stock characters are possibly a reference to the abuse that Dahl stated that he experienced in the [[boarding school]]s he attended.<ref name=IND/> They usually contain a lot of [[black comedy|black humour]] and grotesque scenarios, including gruesome violence. ''[[The Witches (book)|The Witches]]'', ''[[George's Marvellous Medicine]]'' and ''[[Matilda (novel)|Matilda]]'' are examples of this formula. ''[[The BFG]]'' follows it in a more analogous way with the good giant (the BFG or "Big Friendly Giant") representing the "good adult" archetype and the other giants being the "bad adults". This formula is also somewhat evident in Dahl's film script for ''[[Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (film)|Chitty Chitty Bang Bang]]''. Class-conscious themes&nbsp;<U+2013> ranging from the thinly veiled to the blatant&nbsp;<U+2013> also surface in works such as ''[[Fantastic Mr Fox]]'' and ''[[Danny, the Champion of the World]]''.

Dahl also features in his books characters who are very fat, usually children. [[Augustus Gloop]], Bruce Bogtrotter and Bruno Jenkins are a few of these characters, although an enormous woman named Aunt Sponge is featured in ''[[James and the Giant Peach]]'' and the nasty farmer Boggis in ''[[Fantastic Mr Fox]]'' is an enormously fat character. All of these characters (with the possible exception of Bruce Bogtrotter) are either villains or simply unpleasant gluttons. They are usually punished for this: Augustus Gloop drinks from [[Willy Wonka]]'s chocolate river, disregarding the adults who tell him not to, and falls in, getting sucked up a pipe and nearly being turned into fudge. In ''[[Matilda (novel)|Matilda]]'', Bruce Bogtrotter steals cake from the evil headmistress, Miss Trunchbull, and is forced to eat a gigantic chocolate cake in front of the school. Featuring in ''[[The Witches (book)|The Witches]]'', Bruno Jenkins is turned into a mouse by witches who lure him to their convention with the promise of chocolate, and, it is speculated, possibly disowned or even killed by his parents because of this. Aunt Sponge is flattened by a giant peach. Dahl's mother used to tell him and his sisters tales about trolls and other mythical Norwegian creatures and some of his children's books contain references or elements inspired by these stories, such as the giants in ''[[The BFG]]'', the fox family in ''[[Fantastic Mr Fox]]'' and the trolls in ''[[The Minpins]]''.

In his poetry, Dahl gives a humorous re-interpretation of well-known nursery rhymes and [[fairy tales]], providing surprise endings in place of the traditional happily-ever-after. Dahl's collection of poems ''[[Revolting Rhymes]]'' is recorded in [[audio book]] form, and narrated by actor [[Alan Cumming]].<ref>[http://books.google.co.uk/books?ei=lDYYTeqYKcfPhAfYudS4Dg&ct=result&id=Y7aeAAAAMAAJ&dq=audio+book+dirty+beasts&q=alan+cumming AV guide, Volumes 77<U+2013>82] Scranton Gillette Communications, 1998</ref>

===Screenplays===
For a brief period in the 1960s, Dahl wrote screenplays. Two, the [[James Bond]] film ''[[You Only Live Twice (film)|You Only Live Twice]]'' and ''[[Chitty Chitty Bang Bang]]'', were adaptations of novels by [[Ian Fleming]], though both were rewritten and completed by other writers. Dahl created the [[Child Catcher]], the supporting antagonist in ''Chitty Chitty Bang Bang''; in a 2005 poll, it was voted the scariest villain in children's literature.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/cbbcnews/hi/newsid_4520000/newsid_4529100/4529175.stm Childcatcher is scariest villain] ''[[BBC]]'' Retrieved 31 January 2011</ref> Dahl also began adapting his own novel ''Charlie and the Chocolate Factory'', which was completed and rewritten by [[David Seltzer]] after Dahl failed to meet deadlines, and produced as the film ''[[Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory]]'' (1971). Dahl later disowned the film, saying he was "disappointed" because "he thought it placed too much emphasis on Willy Wonka and not enough on Charlie".<ref>Liz Buckingham, trustee for the Roald Dahl Museum, quoted in Tom Bishop: "[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4660873.stm Willy Wonka's Everlasting Film Plot]", BBC News, July 2005</ref> He was also "infuriated" by the deviations in the plot devised by David Seltzer in his draft of the screenplay. This resulted in his refusal for any more versions of the book to be made in his lifetime, as well as an adaption for the sequel ''[[Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator]]''.<ref>Tom Bishop (July 2005) [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4660873.stm Willy Wonka's Everlasting Film Plot] ''[[BBC News]]''</ref>

===Influences===
A major part of Dahl's literary influences stemmed from his childhood. In his younger days, he was an avid reader, especially awed by fantastic tales of heroism and triumph. Amongst his favourite authors were [[Rudyard Kipling]], [[William Makepeace Thackeray]], [[Frederick Marryat]] and [[Charles Dickens]], and their works went on to make a lasting mark on his life and writing.{{cn|date=June 2014}} Dahl was also a huge fan of ghost stories and claimed that ''Trolls'' by [[Jonas Lie]] was one of the finest ghost stories ever written. While he was still a youngster, his mother, Sofie Dahl, would relate traditional Norwegian myths and legends from her native homeland to Dahl and his sisters. Dahl always maintained that his mother and her stories had a strong influence on his writing. In one interview, he mentioned: "She was a great teller of tales. Her memory was prodigious and nothing that ever happened to her in her life was forgotten."<ref>[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/3559378/Roald-Dahl-young-tales-of-the-unexpected.html Roald Dahl: young tales of the unexpected] ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'' (30 August 2008)</ref> When Dahl started writing and publishing his famous books for children, he created a grandmother character in ''[[The Witches (book)|The Witches]]'' and later stated that she was based directly on his own mother as a tribute.<ref name=infloox>[http://www.infloox.com/person?id=6a5f6877 "Roald Dahl"]. infloox: Favourite Books, Influences, Affinities (infloox.com).

===Television===

In 1961, Dahl hosted and wrote for a science fiction and [[Horror and terror|horror]] television [[anthology series]] called ''[[Way Out (TV series)|Way Out]]'', which preceded the ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|Twilight Zone]]'' series on the [[CBS]] network for 14 episodes from March to July.<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0054574/ Way Out (TV Series 1961)] [[IMDB]]</ref> One of the last dramatic network shows shot in New York City, the entire series is available for viewing at [[The Paley Center for Media]] in New York City and Los Angeles.<ref>[http://www.paleycenter.org/collection/item/?q=gunsmoke&p=4&item=T:06395 "The Paley Center for Media: Way Out"]. PaleyCenter.org. Retrieved 28 May 2012</ref> He also wrote for the satirical BBC comedy programme ''[[That Was the Week That Was]]'' which was hosted by [[David Frost]].<ref>McCann 2006, p.156</ref>

The British television series, ''[[Tales of the Unexpected (TV series)|Tales of the Unexpected]]'', originally aired on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] between 1979 and 1988.<ref>[http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/series/861 "BFI: Film and TV Database <U+2013> Tales of the Unexpected"].
