== History ==
=== Early years (1991<U+2013>1998) ===
In 1991, friends [[Marcos Curiel]] and [[Noah Bernardo|Wuv Bernardo]] engaged in [[jam session]]s, with Marcos covering guitar and Wuv playing the drums with no vocalist.<ref>{{cite web |last=Anonymous |title=''P.O.D.'' |publisher=San Diego Reader |accessdate=11 December 2009 |url= http://www.sandiegoreader.com/bands/pod/}}</ref> Calling themselves Eschatos, they started playing at keg parties doing [[Metallica]] and [[Slayer]] cover songs. After his mother's fatal illness, [[Sonny Sandoval]] converted to Christianity and was asked by his cousin, Wuv Bernardo, to join the band as a way to keep his mind straight as mentioned on their [[DVD]], ''[[Still Payin' Dues]]''. They got a [[bassist|bass player]], Gabe Portillo, and eventually changed their name to P.O.D. After recording a demo tape, [[Traa Daniels]] joined the band in 1994 when they needed a bassist for some shows to replace Gabe. P.O.D. signed with [[Rescue Records]], a label created by Wuv's father. Between 1994 and 1997, they released three albums under the label, ''[[Snuff the Punk]]'', ''[[Brown (P.O.D. album)|Brown]]'' and ''[[Payable on Death Live]]''.<ref name="P.O.D. Biography" />

Shortly after the release of ''Payable on Death Live'', [[Essential Records (Christian)|Essential Records]] offered P.O.D. a $100,000 recording contract, but Sonny Sandoval spoke for them all when he politely but firmly told band manager Tim Cook to decline the offer because, <U+201C>God has a bigger plan for P.O.D.<U+201D><ref name="Promotion Crew: P.O.D.

Biography" /> P.O.D. soon released ''[[The Warriors EP]]'', a tribute [[Extended play|EP]] to their loyal fans as a transitional album from Rescue Records to Atlantic Records.

=== Mainstream success (1999<U+2013>2002) ===
P.O.D.'s third studio album, 1999's ''[[The Fundamental Elements of Southtown]]'', spawned the hits "[[Southtown (P.O.D. song)|Southtown]]" and ''[[Total Request Live]]'' favorite "[[Rock the Party (Off the Hook)]]", which became their first video to reach #1 on MTV's TRL '''(Total Request Live)'''.<ref name="Rock the Party hits #1">{{cite web |url=http://www.atrl.net/trlarchive/?s=recap&y=2000&m=07 |title=Rock the Party hits #1 |accessdate=2008-01-04 |author=Absolute TRL staff |date= |work= ATRL.net |quote= }}</ref> At a time after the 1999 album, "[[School of Hard Knocks (song)|School of Hard Knocks]]" was featured on the soundtrack for ''[[Little Nicky]]'' while both "[[Southtown (P.O.D. song)|Southtown]]" and "[[Rock the Party (Off the Hook)]]" appeared in the movie. All three [[music video]]s endured heavy play on [[MTV2]] and the songs were rock radio hits. The album went on to become [[RIAA certification|RIAA certified]] platinum.<ref name="P.O.D. Biography" />

On the [[September 11 Attacks|11th September 2001]] P.O.D. released their fourth studio album, ''[[Satellite (album)|Satellite]]''. The album's first single, "[[Alive (P.O.D. song)|Alive]]", went on to become one of [[MTV]]'s and [[MTV2]]'s top played videos of the year. The video's popularity, as well as the song's positive message, helped the song become a huge [[Rock music|modern rock]] radio hit and it was [[Grammy]] nominated for [[Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance|Best Hard Rock Performance]] in 2002.

The album's second single, "[[Youth of the Nation]]", was influenced in part by the [[school shooting]]s at [[Santana High School#History|Santana High School]], [[Columbine High School massacre|Columbine High School]], and [[Granite Hills High School (El Cajon, California)|Granite Hills High School]]. It was [[Grammy]] nominated for [[Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance|Best Hard Rock Performance]] in 2003. The 2002 singles, "[[Boom (P.O.D. song)|Boom]]" and "[[Satellite (P.O.D. song)|Satellite]]", also became quite popular. In addition, the concluding track of the album, "Portrait," was [[Grammy]] nominated for [[Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance|Best Metal Performance]] in 2003. ''Satellite'' went on to become RIAA-certified triple platinum.<ref name="Satellite is certified triple-platinum" /> The author of ''Encyclopedia of Contemporary Christian Music'' has described P.O.D. as "One of the biggest success stories in recent Christian music."<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Powell | first = M.

=== Line-up and label changes (2003<U+2013>2006) ===
On February 19, 2003, guitarist Marcos Curiel left the band due to his side project, [[The Accident Experiment]] and "spiritual differences." However, Marcos argued that he was actually kicked out of the band.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1470028/20030219/pod.jhtml | title= Marcos leaves the group |accessdate= 2007-12-04 | author= Moss, Corey | work=[[Music Television]]| date=2003-02-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/search/google/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1819256 | title= Guitarist Marcos exits P.O.D.| accessdate= 2007-12-31 | author=Cohen, Jonathan| date=2003-02-19| work=''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]''}}</ref> Sonny, Wuv and Traa were devastated about Curiel leaving, they considered breaking up the band, but decided to stay together and recruit another guitarist.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.mtv.com/bands/p/pod/news_feature_031124/ | title= There's No Crying In Rock |accessdate=2008-01-04 | author= Wiederhorn, Jon | work=[[Music Television]]| date= | quote= Sandoval, drummer Wuv and bassist Traa were devastated and considered breaking up the band.

On November 4, 2003, P.O.D. released their fifth studio album, ''[[Payable on Death]]'', which saw the group shift from their well known rapcore sound to a darker, more melodic metal sound.<ref name="Payable on Death Review">{{cite web | url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r659730|pure_url=yes}} | title= Payable on Death Review|accessdate=2008-01-23|author=Collar, Matt |date= |quote=A darker album than its predecessor, Payable is built largely around Truby's precise slabs of distorted guitar.

== Style and influences ==
The band's name, Payable on Death (P.O.D.), derives itself from the [[Christian theology|Christian doctrine]] that how an individual lives their life on Earth does not determine their eternal [[Afterlife#Christianity|destination]], but rather that Jesus Christ paid for the sins of people who put their faith in him (from which will come a transformation in their life evident of their stance as a new creation, righteous before God by the blood of Christ).<ref name="H. P. Newquist, Rich Maloof"/> P.O.D.'s style has evolved over the years, from the [[rap metal]] sound on their early albums to the [[nu metal]] and Reggae infused [[alternative metal]] styles for which they're most well known. Their latest album, ''[[When Angels & Serpents Dance]]'', is a combination of alternative rock, reggae rock and Latin influenced metal with almost none of the rap metal or nu metal sound of their older releases. P.O.D.'s influences include [[Santana (band)|Santana]], [[Bad Brains]], [[Bob Marley]], [[The Police]], [[Metallica]], [[Rage Against the Machine]] and [[Black Sabbath]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}
