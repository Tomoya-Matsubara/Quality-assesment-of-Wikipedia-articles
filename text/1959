'''The 5 Point Cafe''' is a bar and 24-hour cafe and bar in the [[Belltown, Seattle|Belltown]] neighborhood of [[Seattle]], Washington. It is located by [[Tilikum Place]] near a five-way intersection. Open since 1929, it is a [[drinking establishment]] that is considered the oldest in the neighborhood. The bar has received accolades from local media for being one of the best [[dive bar]]s in the city.

==History==
The building was originally constructed by the Webb Investment Company in 1922 for use as a dairy warehouse. It was built in what was known as the [[Denny Regrade, Seattle|Denny Regrade]], named after a project to flatten Denny Hill. C. Preston Smith opened the cafe during an [[Great Depression in the United States|economic downturn]] in 1929. Coffee, two eggs, a ham steak, hashbrowns, and four pieces of buttered toast with jelly cost 40&nbsp;cents.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=SJ8SAAAAIBAJ&sjid=1PYDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5469,336087&dq=5+point+cafe+seattle&hl=en|title=Good Old Prices|date=July 5, 1979|work=The Bulletin|page=11|accessdate=April 17, 2010|location=Bend, OR}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> Smaller dishes were 25&nbsp;cents or less. A barroom was opened adjacent to the cafe upon the repeal of [[Prohibition in the United States|prohibition]] in 1933 to sell beer and wine. It became a lounge when state law allowed for the sale of [[hard liquor]] in 1944.<ref name="KOMO">{{cite news|url=http://www.komonews.com/news/local/78732982.html?tab=video|title=Historic cafe to offer 1929 prices|last=Jaffe|first=Elisa|publisher=KOMO News|accessdate=April 17, 2010}}</ref>

The 5 Point Cafe made headlines in August 2004 when radio personality [[Tom Leykis]] was ejected and then assaulted outside. Leykis said his assailant kicked him in the head and knocked him to the ground. He was cut above the eye and needed 17 [[Surgical suture|stitches]].<ref name="KOMO"/><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/local/189093_leykis02.html|title=Seattle man arrested in Leykis assault|date=September 2, 2004|work=Seattle Post-Intelligencer|accessdate=April 17, 2010}}</ref>

There were rumors of the establishment's pending closure in September 2009.<ref name="Seattle Times 2009-12-01"/> In November 2009, it was purchased by David Meinert. He has changed little but the menu was expanded slightly with vegetarian options.<ref name="Belltown Messenger 2009-11-25">{{cite news|url=http://www.belltownmessenger.com/122009/74-5pointcafe.html|title=The First Family of Belltown |last=Bonow|first=Elaine|date=November 25, 2009 |work=Belltown Messenger|accessdate=April 17, 2010}}</ref>

The 5 Point Cafe serves large portions of traditional American food and stiff drinks at inexpensive prices. Located in what is now an affluent neighborhood, it has historically catered to [[working class]] and eclectic patrons. [[Brassiere]]s dangle from a stuffed moose head and there is a [[juke box]] with an expansive collection.<ref name="KOMO"/><ref name="Belltown Messenger 2009-11-25"/><ref>{{cite news|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/allyoucaneat/2010404599_reader_gets_his_point_across_h.html|title=5 Point trip down memory lane: he's been there, seen that|last=Leson|first=Nancy|date=December 1, 2009|work=The Seattle Times|accessdate=April 17, 2010}}</ref> 

The cafe has been called one of the best dive bars in the world by the alternative weekly newspaper ''The Stranger''.<ref>http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/bar-exam/Content?oid=1845168</ref> It has been voted "Best Dive Bar" in Seattle  several times by ''Seattle Magazine''.<ref>http://www.seattlemag.com/article/dining/best-seattle-restaurants-2011-readers-choice-winners</ref>
