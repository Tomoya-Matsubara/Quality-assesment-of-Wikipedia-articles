'''Major [[histocompatibility]] complex''' ('''MHC''') is a cell surface molecule encoded  by a large [[gene family]] in all [[vertebrate]]s.  MHC molecules mediate interactions of [[leukocytes]], also called [[white blood cells]] (WBCs), which are [[immune cells]], with other leukocytes or body cells.  MHC determines compatibility of donors for [[organ transplant]] as well as one's susceptibility to an [[autoimmune disease]] via crossreacting immunization.  In humans, MHC is also called [[human leukocyte antigen]] (HLA).

[[Protein]] molecules<U+2014>either of the host's own [[phenotype]] or of other biologic entities<U+2014>are continually synthesized and degraded in a [[Cell (biology)|cell]]. Occurring on the cell surface, each MHC molecule displays a molecular fraction, called [[epitope]], of a protein, somewhat like a hot dog (epitope) within a bun (MHC).<ref>[http://users.rcn.com/jkimball.ma.ultranet/BiologyPages/H/HLA.html Kimball's Biology], Histocompatibility Molecules</ref>  The presented antigen can be either ''self'' or ''nonself''.  On the cell membrane, the MHC population in its entirety is like a meter indicating the balance of proteins within the cell.

The MHC gene family is divided into three subgroups<U+2014>class I, class II, and class III.  Diversity of antigen presentation, mediated by MHC classes I and II, is attained in multiple ways: (1) the MHC's genetic encoding is [[polygenic]], (2) MHC genes are highly [[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphic]] and have many [[alleles|variants]], (3) several MHC genes are expressed from both inherited [[alleles]].

==Discovery of the MHC locus==
The MHC genes were originally identified in inbred strains of mice. [[Clarence Little]] transplanted tumors between different strains of mice and found that transplanted tumors were rejected based on the genetic relation of the host and donor.<ref>Little C. C., 1941 The genetics of tumor transplantation, pp. 279<U+2013>309 in Biology of the Laboratory Mouse, edited by Snell G. D.. Dover, New York.</ref>  [[George Snell]] then identified the MHC locus by selectively breeding two different mouse strains in order to create a new mouse strain that was almost genetically identical to one of the original parental strains, differing only in the locus that governs histocompatibility (the ability for a tumor to be accepted).<ref> Snell G. D., Higgins G. F., 1951 Alleles at the histocompatibility-2 locus in the mouse as determined by tumor transplantation. Genetics 36: 306<U+2013>310</ref> George Snell shared the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 1980 for this work.

==MHC in animal immunity==
Of the three MHC classes identified, human focus commonly goes to class I and class II.  MHC class II mediates immunization<U+2014>specific immunity<U+2014>to an antigen.  MHC class I thereafter mediates destruction of host cells displaying that antigen.

Some mature [[leukocytes]] of the lineage [[lymphocyte]]<U+2014>residing in peripheral lymphoid tissues such as [[lymphoid follicles]] and [[lymph nodes]]<U+2014>bear receptors that ligate MHC.  [[T cells]], which are lymphocytes of [[specific immunity]], as well as [[NK cell|natural killer cells]] (NK cells), which are lymphocytes that act innately, interact with MHC.  When MHC class I expression is low altogether<U+2014>suggesting abnormal cell function<U+2014>NK cells prompt [[programmed cell death]] of the cell. ([[B cells]], the other lymphocyte mediating specific immunity, secrete antibody molecules, but do not ligate MHC.)

MHC class II can be conditionally expressed by all cell types, but normally occurs only on professional [[antigen-presenting cells]] (APCs): [[macrophages]], [[B cells]], and especially [[dendritic cells]] (DCs). An APC uptakes an antigen, performs [[antigen processing]], and returns a molecular fraction<U+2014>the epitope<U+2014>to the APC's surface within an MHC class II molecule for [[antigen presentation]].  The [[CD4]] receptors borne by naive [[helper T cells]] ligate MHC class II while the epitope<U+2014>within the MHC class II molecule<U+2014>imprints the [[T cell receptor]] (TCR) of the naive helper T cell, , either type 1 (Th1), type 2 (Th2), type 17 (Th17), or regulatory phenotype (Treg), as so far identified.  Thus MHC class II mediates immunization to<U+2014>or, if helping prime Treg, mediates [[immune tolerance]] of<U+2014>an antigen.

MHC class I occurs on all [[nucleated]] cells<U+2014>in essence all cells but [[red blood cells]].  MHC class I presents epitopes to [[cytotoxic T cells]], also called killer T cells, which express the [[CD8]] molecule.  When its CD8 docks to MHC class I, if its TCR recognizes its matching epitope, the killer T cell induces the cell's [[apoptosis]].  Thus MHC class I helps mediate [[cellular immunity]].  (B cells express MHC class II to present antigen to Th0, but when its [[B cell receptor]] is ligated by its own matching epitope<U+2014>an interaction not mediated by MHC<U+2014>the activated B cell secretes soluble [[immunoglobulins]]: [[antibody]] molecules mediating [[humoral immunity]].)

==MHC genes==
MHC gene families are found in all [[vertebrate]]s, though they vary widely, [[chicken]]s having among the smallest known MHC regions (19 genes).  In [[human]]s the MHC region occurs on chromosome 6, between the flanking [[genetic marker]]s MOG and COL11A2 (from 6p22.1 to 6p21.3 ~29Mb to 33Mb on the hg19 assembly), and contains 140 genes spanning 3.6 mega [[base pairs]] (3.6 Mb or 3 600 000 bases).<ref name="MHCsc">{{cite journal | title=Complete sequence and gene map of a human major histocompatibility complex | last=MHC Sequencing Consortium | year=1999 | journal=Nature | volume=401 | pages=921<U+2013>923 | doi=10.1038/44853 | pmid=10553908 | issue=6756}}</ref>  About half have known immune functions.

==MHC proteins==
MHC proteins have [[immunoglobulin]]-like structure.

 [[File:MHC Class 1.svg|right|200px|thumb|'''MHC class I protein molecule''']]

=== Class I ===
{{Main|MHC class I}}

MHC I occurs as an <U+03B1> chain composed of three domains<U+2014><U+03B1>1, <U+03B1>2, <U+03B1>3.  The <U+03B1>1 rests upon a unit of the non-MHC molecule [[Beta-2 microglobulin|<U+03B2>2 microglobulin]] (encoded on human chromosome 15).  The <U+03B1>3 subunit is transmembrane, anchoring the MHC class I molecule to the cell membrane.  The peptide being presented is held by the floor of the [[peptide-binding groove]], in the central region of the <U+03B1>1/<U+03B1>2 [[heterodimer]] (a molecule composed of two nonidentical subunits).  The genetically encoded and expressed sequence of amino acids, the sequence of ''residues'', of the peptide-binding groove's floor determines which particular peptide residues it binds.<ref name="pmid10935972">{{cite journal | author = Toh H, Savoie CJ, Kamikawaji N, Muta S, Sasazuki T, Kuhara S | title = Changes at the floor of the peptide-binding groove induce a strong preference for proline at position 3 of the bound peptide: molecular dynamics simulations of HLA-A*0217 | journal = Biopolymers | volume = 54 | issue = 5 | pages = 318<U+2013>27 | year = 2000 | month = October | pmid = 10935972 | doi = 10.1002/1097-0282(20001015)54:5<318::AID-BIP30>3.0.CO;2-T }}</ref>

 [[File:MHC Class 2.svg|right|150px|thumb|'''MHC class II protein molecule''']]

'''Classical MHC molecules''' present epitopes to the [[T-cell receptor|TCRs]] of CD8+ T lymphocytes.  '''Nonclassical molecules''' (MHC class IB) exhibit limited polymorphism, expression patterns, and presented antigens; this group is subdivided into a group encoded within MHC loci (e.g., HLA-E, -F, -G) as well as those not (e.g., [[induced-self antigen|stress ligands]] such as ULBPs, Rae1, H60); the antigen/ligand for many of these molecules remain unknown, but they can interact with both CD8+ T cells, NKT cells, and NK cells.

=== Class II ===
{{Main|MHC class II}}

MHC class two is formed of two chains, <U+03B1> and <U+03B2>, each having two domains<U+2014><U+03B1>1 and <U+03B1>2 and <U+03B2>1 and <U+03B2>2<U+2014>each chain having a transmembrane domain, <U+03B1>2 and <U+03B2>2, respectively, anchoring the MHC class II molecule to the cell membrane.<ref name="ABBAS" />  The peptide-binding groove is formed of the heterodimer of <U+03B1>1 and <U+03B2>1.

MHC class II molecules in humans have five to six isotypes.  '''Classic molecules''' present peptides to CD4+ lymphocytes.  '''Nonclassic molecules''', accessories, with intracellular functions, are not exposed on cell membranes, but in internal membranes in [[lysosome]]s, normally loading the antigenic peptides onto classic MHC class II molecules.

=== Class III ===
Class III molecules have physiologic roles unlike classes I and class II, but are encoded between them in the short arm of human chromosome 6.  Class III molecules include several secreted proteins with immune functions: components of the [[complement system]] (such as C2, C4, and B factor), [[cytokine]]s (such as [[TNF-alpha|TNF-<U+03B1>]], LTA, LTB), and [[heat shock protein]]s (hsp).

== Antigen processing and presentation ==
[[File:MHC Class I processing.svg|left|350px|thumb|'''MHC class I pathway''': Proteins in the [[cytosol]] are degraded by the [[proteasome]], liberating peptides internalized by [[transporter associated with antigen processing|TAP]] channel in the [[endoplasmic reticulum]], there associating with MHC-I molecules freshly synthesized. MHC-I/peptide complexes enter [[Golgi apparatus]], are [[glycosylation|glycosylated]], enter secratory vesicles, fuse with the [[cell membrane]], and externalize on the cell membrane interacting with T lymphocytes.]]

Peptides are processed and presented by two classical pathways:
* In '''MHC class II''' [[phagocytes]] such as [[macrophages]] and immature [[dendritic cells]] uptake entities by [[phagocytosis]] into [[phagosomes]]<U+2014>though [[B cells]] exhibit the more general [[endocytosis]] into [[endosomes]]<U+2014>which fuse with [[lysosomes]] whose acidic enzymes cleave the uptaken protein into many different peptides.  Via [[physicochemical dynamics]] in molecular interaction with the particular MHC class II variants borne by the host, encoded in the host's genome, a particular peptide exhibits [[immunodominance]] and loads onto MHC class II molecules.  These are trafficked to and externalized on the cell surface.<ref name="aderem">{{cite journal | author = Aderem A, Underhill DM | title = Mechanisms of phagocytosis in macrophages | journal = Annu. Rev. Immunol. | volume = 17 | issue = | pages = 593<U+2013>623 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10358769 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.immunol.17.1.593 }}</ref>
* In '''MHC class I''' any nucleated cell normally presents cytosolic peptides, mostly ''self'' peptides derived from protein turnover and defective ribosomal products.  During viral infection, intracellular microorganism infection, or cancerous transformation, such proteins degraded in the [[proteosome]] are as well loaded onto MHC class I molecules and displayed on the cell surface.  T lymphocytes can detect a peptide displayed at 0.1%-1% of the MHC molecules.

==T lymphocyte recognition restrictions==
{{Main|MHC restriction}}

In their development in the [[thymus]], T lymphocytes are selected to recognize MHC molecules of the host but not recognize other self antigens.  Following selection each T lymphocyte shows dual specificity: The T cell receptor (TCR) recognizes ''self'' MHC but only ''non-self'' antigens.

MHC restriction occurs during lymphocyte development in the thymus through a process known as positive selection.  T cells that do not receive a positive survival signal <U+2014> mediated mainly by thymic epithelial cells presenting ''self'' peptides bound to MHC molecules <U+2014> to their TCR undergo [[apoptosis]].  Positive selection ensures that mature T cells can functionally recognize MHC molecules in the periphery (i.e. elsewhere in the body).

The TCRs of T lymphocytes recognise only [[sequential epitope]]s, also called [[linear epitope]]s, of only peptides and only if coupled within an MHC molecule.  (Antibody molecules secreted by [[plasma cell|activated B cells]], on the other hand, ligate diverse epitopes<U+2014>[[peptide]], [[lipid]], [[carbohydrate]], and [[nucleic acid]]<U+2014>and recognize [[conformational epitope]]s, which have [[Three-dimensional space|3D]] structure.)

==MHC in sexual mate selection==
{{main|Major Histocompatibility Complex and Sexual Selection}}
{{See also|Interpersonal compatibility}}

MHC molecules enable immune system surveillance of the population of protein molecules in a host cell, and greater MHC diversity permits greater diversity of [[antigen presentation]].  In 1976 Yamazaki ''et al'' demonstrated preference by male mice for females of different MHC.  Similar results have been obtained with [[fish]]<ref name="boehm">{{cite journal | title=MHC peptides and the sensory evaluation of genotype | author=Boehm T | coauthors=Zufall F | year=2006 | journal=Trends Neurosci | issue=2 | volume=29 | pages=100<U+2013>107 | pmid=16337283 | doi=10.1016/j.tins.2005.11.006}}</ref> and [[bird]]s (eg. the [[black-throated blue warbler]]s).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=S.B.|coauthors=Webster, M.S.; Holmes, R.T.|title=The heterozygosity theory of extra-pair mate choice in birds: a test and a cautionary note|journal=Journal of Avian Biology|year=2005|volume=36|pages=146<U+2013>154 |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.0908-8857.2005.03417.x/abstract}}{{paywall}}</ref> Some data find lower rates of [[early pregnancy loss]] in human couples of dissimilar MHC genes.<ref name="Haig">{{cite journal | author = Haig D | title = Maternal-fetal interactions and MHC polymorphism | journal = J.

==MHC evolutionary diversity==
Most [[mammal]]s have MHC variants similar to those of humans, who bear great [[gene pool|allelic diversity]], especially among the nine classical genes<U+2014>seemingly due largely to [[gene duplication]]<U+2014>though human MHC regions have many [[pseudogene]]s.  The most diverse loci, namely HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-DRB1, have roughly 1000, 1600, and 870 known alleles, respectively.  Many HLA alleles are ancient, sometimes of greater [[Homology (biology)|homology]] to a chimpanzee MHC alleles than to some other human alleles of the same gene.

MHC allelic diversity has challenged [[Evolutionary biology|evolutionary biologists]] for explanation. Most posit [[balancing selection]] (see [[polymorphism (biology)]]), which is any [[natural selection]] process whereby no single allele is absolutely most fit, such as [[frequency-dependent selection]] and [[heterozygote advantage]]. Recent models suggest that a high number of alleles is implausible via heterozygote advantage alone.{{cn}}

Pathogenic co-evolution, a counter-hypothesis, posits that common alleles are under greatest pathogenic pressure, driving positive selection of uncommon alleles<U+2014>moving targets, so to say, for pathogens. As pathogenic pressure on the previously common alleles decreases, their frequency in the population stabilizes, and remain circulating in a large population. Despite great MHC polymorphism at the population level, an individual bears at most 18 MHC I or II alleles.

Relatively low MHC diversity has been observed in the [[cheetah]] (''Acinonyx jubatus''),<ref name="Castro-Prieto">{{cite journal | author = Castro-Prieto A, Wachter B, Sommer S | title = Cheetah paradigm revisited: MHC diversity in the world's largest free-ranging population | journal = Mol.

== MHC in transplant rejection ==
In a transplant procedure, as of an organ or [[stem cells]], MHC molecules act themselves as [[antigen]]s and can provoke immune response in the recipient<U+2014>thus transplant rejection.  MHC molecules were identified and named after their role in [[organ transplant|transplant]] rejection between mice of different strains, though it took over 20 years to clarify MHC's role in presenting peptide antigens to [[cytotoxic T lymphocytes]] (CTLs).<ref name="ABBAS Ch.10">{{cite book | last =Abbas | authorlink = | coauthors = Lichtman A.H. | editor = | others = | title = Basic Immunology. Functions and disorders of the immune system | edition = 3rd | date = | year = 2009| month = | location =  | isbn = 978-1-4160-4688-2 | pages = | chapter = Ch.10 Immune responses against tumors and transplant | chapterurl = | citation = | page = A.B. | editor3 = Saunders (Elsevier) }}</ref>

Each human cell expresses six MHC class I alleles (one HLA-A, -B, and -C allele from each parent) and six to eight MHC class 2 alleles (one HLA-DP and -DQ, and one or two HLA-DR from each parent, and combinations of these).  The MHC variation in the human population is high, at least 350 alleles for HLA-A genes, 620 alleles for HLA-B, 400 alleles for DR, and 90 alleles for DQ.  Any two individuals not identical twins express differing MHC molecules.  All MHC molecules can mediate transplant rejection, but HLA-C and HLA-DP, showing low polymorphism, seem least important.

When maturing in the [[thymus]] gland, [[T lymphocyte]]s are selected for their T cell receptors ([[T-cell receptor|TCR]]) incapacity to recognize ''self antigens''.  Yet T lymphocytes can react against the donor MHC's [[peptide-binding groove]], the variable region of MHC holding the presented antigen's [[epitope]] for recognition by TCR, the matching [[paratope]].  T lymphocytes of the recipient take the incompatible peptide-binding groove as ''nonself antigen''.  The T lymphocytes' recognition of the foreign MHC as self is ''[[allorecognition]]''.

Transplant rejection has two types known as mediated by MHC (HLA):
* '''Hyperacute rejection''' occurs when, before the trasplantation, the recipient has preformed anti-HLA antibodies, perhaps by previous blood transfusions (donor tissue that includes lymphocytes expressing HLA molecules), by anti-HLA generated during pregnancy (directed at the father's HLA displayed by the fetus), or by previous transplantation;
* '''Acute humoral rejection and chronic disfunction''' occurs when the recipient's anti-HLA antibodies form directed at HLA molecules present on [[endothelial cells]] of the transplanted tissue.

In either situation,  immunity is directed at the transplanted organ, sustaining lesions.  A ''cross-reaction test'' between potential donor cells and recipient serum seeks to detect presence of preformed anti-HLA antibodies in the potential recipient that recognize donor HLA molecules, so as to prevent hyperacute rejection. In normal circumstances, compatibility between HLA-A, -B, and -DR molecules is assessed.  The higher the number of incompatibilities, the lower the five-year survival rate.  Global databases of donor information enhance the search for compatible donors.

{{Main|Human leukocyte antigen}}
Human MHC class I and II are also called ''[[human leukocyte antigen]]'' (HLA).  To clarify the usage, some of the biomedical literature uses HLA to refer specifically to the HLA protein molecules and reserves MHC for the region of the genome that encodes for this molecule, but this is not a consistent convention.

The most intensely studied HLA genes are the nine so-called classical MHC genes: [[HLA-A]], [[HLA-B]], [[HLA-C]], [[HLA-DPA1]], [[HLA-DPB1]], [[HLA-DQA1]], [[HLA-DQB1]], [[HLA-DRA]], and [[HLA-DRB1]]. In humans, the MHC is divided into three regions: classes I, II, and III.  The A, B, C, E, F, and G genes belong to MHC class I, whereas the six D genes belong to class II.

MHC genes are expressed in codominant fashion.<ref name="ABBAS">{{cite book | last =Abbas | authorlink = | coauthors = Lichtman A.H. | editor = | others = | title = Basic Immunology.

* As there are 3 Class-I genes, named in humans HLA-A, HLA-B and HLA-C, and as each person inherits a set of genes from each progenitor, that means that any cell in an individual can express 6 different types of MHC-I molecules (see figure).
* In the Class-II locus, each person inherits a pair of HLA-DP genes (DPA1 and DPB1, which encode <U+03B1> and <U+03B2> chains), a couple of genes HLA-DQ (DQA1 and DQB1, for <U+03B1> and <U+03B2> chains), one gene HLA-DR<U+03B1> (DRA1) and one or more genes HLA-DR<U+03B2> (DRB1 and DRB3, -4 or -5). That means that one [[heterozygous]] individual can inherit 6 or 8 functioning Class-II alleles, three or more from each progenitor. The role of DQA2, DQB2 is not verified. The DRB2, DRB6, DRB7, DRB8 and DRB9 are pseudogenes.

The set of alleles that is present in each chromosome is called MHC [[haplotype]]. In humans, each HLA allele is named with a number. For instance, for a given individual, his haplotype might be HLA-A2, HLA-B5, HLA-DR3, etc... Each heterozygous individual will have two MHC haplotypes, one in each chromosome (one of paternal origin and the other of maternal origin).

The MHC genes are highly polymorphic; this means that there are many different alleles in the different individuals inside a population. The polymorphism is so high that in a mixed population (non-[[endogamy|endogamic]]) there are not two individuals with exactly the same set of MHC genes and molecules, with the exception of [[twin|identical twins]].

The polymorphic regions in each allele are located in the region for peptide contact, which is going to be displayed to the lymphocyte. For this reason, the contact region for each allele of MHC molecule is highly variable, as the polymorphic residues of the MHC will create specific clefts in which only certain types of residues of the peptide can enter. This imposes a very specific link between the MHC molecule and the peptide, and it implies that each MHC variant will be able to bind specifically only those peptides that are able to properly enter in the cleft of the MHC molecule, which is variable for each allele. In this way, the MHC molecules have a broad specificity, because they can bind many, but not all types of possible peptides. This is an essential characteristic of MHC molecules: In a given individual, it is enough to have a few different molecules to be able to display a high variety of peptides.

On the other hand, inside a population, the presence of many different alleles ensures there will always be an individual with a specific MHC molecule able to load the correct peptide to recognize a specific microbe. The evolution of the MHC polymorphism ensures that a population will not succumb to a new pathogen or a mutated one, because at least some individuals will be able to develop an adequate immune response to win over the pathogen.  The variations in the MHC molecules (responsible for the polymorphism) are the result of the inheritance of different MHC molecules, and they are not induced by [[Genetic recombination|recombination]], as it is the case for the antigen [[Immune receptor|receptors]].

Because of the high levels of [[allele|allelic]] diversity found within its genes, MHC has also attracted the attention of many [[evolution]]ary biologists.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}
