'''Illyricum''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|<U+026A>|<U+02C8>|l|<U+026A>|r|<U+0268>|k|<U+0259>|m}}) was a [[Roman province]] that existed between 167 BC and 10 AD, named after conquered ''[[Illyria]]'', stretching from the [[Drin (river)|Drin river]] (in modern north [[Albania]]) to [[Istria]] ([[Croatia]]) in the west and to the [[Sava]] river ([[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]) in the north. [[Salona]] (near modern [[Split (city)|Split]] in Croatia) functioned as its capital. The province was then divided into [[Pannonia]] in the north and [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatia]] in the south.

==History==

===Background===
The [[Roman Navy]]'s first crossing of the [[Adriatic Sea]] in 229 BC<ref>Wilkes, J. J. The Illyrians, 1992, p. 120, ISBN 0-631-19807-5,Page 160,"... ' The Roman invasion of Illyria in 229 sc appears to have caught Teuta and the Illyrians completely off guard. As soon as the weather permitted, the queen had ordered south a naval expedition ..."</ref> involved Rome's first invasion of Illyria, the [[First Illyrian War]]. The Roman Republic finally completed the conquest of Illyria in 168 BC by defeating the army of the Illyrian king [[King Gentius|Gentius]]. From 167 BC, southern Illyria became a formally independent Roman protectorate.

===Roman province===
The region had considerable strategic and economic importance for the Romans. It possessed a number of important commercial ports along its coastline, and had [[gold]]-mines in [[Dalmatia]]<ref>The Illyrians (The Peoples of Europe) by John Wilkes,1996,ISBN-9780631198079,page 224: "... governor of Dalmatia forced the natives to wash out the gold, though they were too ignorant to appreciate its value, and there was an imperial bureau for the Dalmatian gold mines based in Salona</ref> with an imperial bureau in [[Salona]]. Illyria also became the starting point of the [[Via Egnatia]], the great [[Roman road]] that ran from [[Dyrrachium]] (modern [[Durr<U+00EB>s]] in [[Albania]]), on the [[Adriatic]], to [[Byzantium]] in the east.

In 59 BC the ''[[Lex Vatinia]]'' assigned Illyricum (together with [[Cisalpine Gaul]]) as a ''provincia''  (zone of responsibility rather than a "province" as understood today) to [[Julius Caesar]]. The Roman administration did not establish a province until [[Augustus|Octavian]]'s wars in Illyricum in  the period 35-33 BC. The first mention of the province of Illyricum occurs in the context of Augustan settlement of 27 BC, when it was assigned as a propraetorial province to imperial control.

[[File:Roman provinces of Illyricum, Macedonia, Dacia, Moesia, Pannonia and Thracia.jpg|thumb|right|The Roman province of Illyricum comprised Dalmatia and the southwestern half of Pannonia ([[Lower Pannonia]]).]]
As the Romans expanded their power in the region through a series of campaigns known as the Pannonian War or as the Pannonian wars (Bellum Pannonicum, 12-9 BC), fought against group of peoples known as the [[Pannonians]], they enlarged the province of Illyricum.

After crushing the [[Great Illyrian Revolt]] of [[Pannonians]] and [[Daesitiates]] subsequent to 10 (some scholars such as Jeno Fitz move this date to middle-late Claudian era c. 20-35), Roman administrators dissolved the province of Illyricum and divided its lands between the new provinces of [[Pannonia]] in the north and [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatia]] in the south.

On the shore of [[Dalmatia]] Roman traders established themselves in a number of towns,<ref>The Roman World History of civilization by Victor Chapot, E. A. Parker,1997,ISBN-0203976770,page 268</ref> [[Iader]], [[Salona]], [[Narona]], [[Epidaurum]]. The capital [[Salona]] was protected by two military camps at [[Burnum]] and [[Delminium]].

In addition to the economic importance of Illyricum, it was a very valuable source of military personnel.<ref>The Invasion of Europe by the Barbarians by J. B. Bury,2000,page 69,"... to his career after the death of his master. The importance of Illyricum did not lie in its revenues, but in its men. ..."</ref>  From the 3rd to the 6th century the most useful troops were recruited<ref>The Invasion of Europe by the Barbarians by J. B. Bury,2000,page 69</ref> from Illyricum (and [[Roman Thrace]] among others).  [[Ronald Syme]]<ref>Augustus (Roman Imperial Biographies) by Pat Southern,1998,ISBN 0-415-16631-4,page 245,</ref> outlined the importance of Illyricum as the province that held the empire together. As a main recruiting ground, with armies ever present in its territory, it possessed<ref>Count Marcellinus and his chronicle by Brian Croke,2001,ISBN-0198150016,page 54</ref> a commander in-chief of the Illyrian army, the ''magister militum per Illyricum'', based at [[Naissus]].

===Diocletian's reforms===
The term "Illyricum" continued to be used to refer to the western [[Balkan peninsula]], and in the mid-4th century, the [[praetorian prefecture of Illyricum]] was set up as one of four [[praetorian prefecture]]s that the Roman Empire was divided into; it encompassed [[Pannonia]], [[Noricum]], [[Crete]], and the whole [[Balkans|Balkan peninsula]] except [[Thrace]]. The prefecture survived until the early 7th century.

===Legacy===
The region's native peoples won renown for their military prowess and they became an important source of manpower for the [[Roman army]]. Several notable [[Roman emperor]]s came from the region, including [[Aurelian]], [[Claudius II]], [[Constantine I]] and [[Diocletian]], as well as the Byzantine emperors [[Anastasius I (emperor)|Anastasius I]] and [[Justinian I]].

The regions which it included changed through the centuries though a great part of ancient [[Illyria]] remained part of Illyricum as a province while south Illyria became [[Epirus Nova]], part<ref>Atlas of Classical History by R. Talbert,1989,page 175: "... divided the diocese of Moesia into two, styled Thracia and Macedonia, the latter consisting of the provinces from Epirus Nova and Macedonia southward. But there is evidence that Constantine considered ...</ref> of Roman [[Macedonia (Roman province)|Macedonia]].
