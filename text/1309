'''The Honeys''' were a [[1960s]] [[girl group]], who recorded for [[Capitol Records]], and were a kind of female counterpart to the [[Beach Boys]]; Beach Boy [[Brian Wilson]] served as their [[record producer]] and chief [[songwriter]].

The Honeys (the name a slang term for a female [[surfing]] enthusiast) consisted of sisters [[Marilyn Rovell|Marilyn]] and [[Diane Rovell]], and their cousin [[Ginger Blake]]. Marilyn and Diane had met the Beach Boys when the boys performed at a [[Hollywood]] club called Pandora's Box, in the early 1960s. Brian and Marilyn (who was still in high school) began dating, and he brought the girls into the [[recording studio]], to produce their songs ("Surfin' Down The Swanee River", "Shoot The Curl", "Pray For Surf"), and included them as backup performers on Beach Boys records. The [[cheerleader]] voices on "[[Be True To Your School]]" were performed by the Honeys, and the two groups sometimes shared the same concert bill.

In [[1964]] The Honeys sang background vocals for [[Jan and Dean]] on  the hit singles, "The New Girl In School", "[[Dead Man's Curve]]", and "[[The Little Old Lady from Pasadena]]".

The Honeys' career faded as surfing music went out of vogue. Marilyn and Brian were married, and became the parents of [[Carnie Wilson|Carnie]] and [[Wendy Wilson]], who later found fame as members of [[Wilson Phillips]]. Marilyn and Diane later re-teamed as a duo called Spring (aka [[American Spring]]), during the [[1970s]].

During the [[1990s]], the Honeys reunited, and performed locally around Hollywood and [[Los Angeles]]. An anthology CD of their music (including several Spring recordings) was also released by [[Capitol Records]] in [[1992]].
