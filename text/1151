'''Nauru''' ({{IPAc-en|lang|audio=en-us-Nauru.ogg|n|<U+0251><U+02D0>|<U+02C8>|u:|r|u<U+02D0>}} {{respell|nah|OO|roo}}), officially the '''Republic of Nauru''' and formerly known as '''Pleasant Island''', is an [[island country]] in [[Micronesia]] in the [[Pacific Ocean|South Pacific]]. Its nearest neighbour is [[Banaba Island]] in [[Kiribati]], {{convert|300|km|mi|0}} to the east. With 9,378 residents in a {{convert|21|km2}} area, Nauru is the smallest state in the [[Pacific Ocean|South Pacific]] and second smallest state by population in the world, behind only [[Vatican City]].

Settled by Micronesian and [[Polynesia]]n people, Nauru was [[Annexation|annexed]] and claimed as a colony by the [[German Empire]] in the late 19th century. After [[World War&nbsp;I]], Nauru became a [[League of Nations mandate]] administered by Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. During [[World War&nbsp;II]], Nauru was occupied by [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] troops, who were bypassed by the Allied advance across the Pacific. After the war ended, the country entered into trusteeship again. Nauru gained its independence in 1968.

Nauru is a [[phosphate rock]] island with rich deposits near the surface, which allow easy [[strip mining]] operations. It has some phosphate resources which, as of 2011, are not economically viable for extraction.<ref>{{cite web|author=Hogan, C Michael|year=2011|url=http://www.eoearth.org/article/Phosphate?topic=49557|title=Phosphate|work=Encyclopedia of Earth|publisher=National Council for Science and the Environment|accessdate=17 June 2012}}</ref> Nauru boasted the highest per-capita income enjoyed by any sovereign state in the world during the late 1960s and early 1970s. When the phosphate reserves were exhausted, and the environment had been seriously harmed by mining, the trust that had been established to manage the island's wealth diminished in value. To earn income, Nauru briefly became a [[tax haven]] and illegal [[money laundering]] centre. From 2001 to 2008, it accepted aid from the [[Australian Government]] in exchange for hosting the [[Nauru detention centre]].

The president of Nauru is [[Baron Waqa]], who heads a 19-member [[Unicameralism|unicameral]] parliament. The country is a member of the [[United Nations]], the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], the [[Asian Development Bank]] and the [[Pacific Islands Forum]]. Nauru also participates in the [[Commonwealth Games|Commonwealth]] and [[Olympic Games]]. Recently Nauru became a member country of the International Renewable Energy Agency ([[IRENA]]).

[[File:Nauru-parliament.jpg|thumb|right|The Nauruan parliament]]

Nauru is a republic with a [[parliamentary system]] of government.<ref name=davidson/> The president is both [[head of state]] and [[head of government]]. A 19-member [[unicameral]] parliament is elected every three years.<ref>Matau, Robert (6 June 2013) [http://www.islandsbusiness.com/news/nauru/1413/president-dabwido-gives-it-another-go/ "President Dabwido gives it another go"].

Four parties that have been active in Nauruan politics are the [[Nauru Party]], the [[Democratic Party of Nauru|Democratic Party]], [[Nauru First]], and the [[Centre Party (Nauru)|Centre Party]]. However, alliances within the government are often formed on the basis of extended family ties rather than party affiliation.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Anckar|first=D|coauthors=Anckar, C|title=Democracies without Parties|journal=Comparative Political Studies|year=2000|volume=33|issue=2|pages=225<U+2013>247|doi=10.1177/0010414000033002003}}</ref>

From 1992 to 1999, Nauru had a local government system known as the Nauru Island Council (NIC). This nine-member council was designed to provide municipal services. The NIC was dissolved in 1999 and all assets and liabilities became vested in the national government.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Hassell, Graham; Tipu, Feue|date=May 2008|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/ComJlLocGov/2008/3.html|title=Local Government in the South Pacific Islands|journal=Commonwealth Journal of Local Governance|volume=1|issue=1|pages=6<U+2013>30}}</ref> [[Land tenure]] on Nauru is unusual: all Nauruans have certain rights to all land on the island, which is owned by individuals and family groups. Government and corporate entities do not own any land, and they must enter into a lease arrangement with landowners to use land. Non-Nauruans cannot own land on the island.<ref name=UNCCD/>

Nauru has a complex legal system. Its [[Supreme Court of Nauru|Supreme Court]], headed by the Chief Justice, is paramount on [[Constitution of Nauru|constitutional issues]]. Other cases can be appealed to the two-judge Appellate Court. Parliament cannot overturn court decisions, but Appellate Court rulings can be appealed to the [[High Court of Australia]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Nauru (High Court Appeals) Act (Australia) 1976|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ncaa1976254|publisher=Australian Legal Information Institute|accessdate=7 August 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Dale|first=Gregory|title=Appealing to Whom?

Lower courts consist of the District Court and the Family Court, both of which are headed by a Resident Magistrate, who also is the Registrar of the Supreme Court. There are two other quasi-courts: the Public Service Appeal Board and the Police Appeal Board, both of which are presided over by the Chief Justice.<ref name=state>{{cite web|url=http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/16447.htm|title=Background Note: Nauru|publisher=State Department Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs|date=September 2005|accessdate=11 May 2006}}</ref>

Nauru has used its position as a member of the United Nations to gain financial support from both [[Taiwan]] (ROC) and China (PRC) by changing its recognition from one to the other under the [[One-China policy]].

A significant portion of Nauru's income has been in the form of aid from Australia.

In what became known as [[Tampa affair|the Tampa affair]], the ship was refused entry and boarded by Australian troops. The refugees were eventually loaded onto Royal Australian Navy vessel HMAS<U+00A0>Manoora and taken to Nauru to be held in detention facilities which later became part of the Howard government's [[Pacific Solution]].

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of Nauru}}

[[File:Aerial view of Nauru.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of Nauru]]

Nauru is a {{convert|21|km2|sqmi|0}}<ref name="CIA" /> oval-shaped island in the southwestern Pacific Ocean, {{convert|42|km|mi|0}} south of the [[Equator]]. The island is surrounded by a coral reef, which is exposed at low tide and dotted with pinnacles.<ref name=state/> The presence of the reef has prevented the establishment of a [[seaport]], although [[Canals in Nauru|channels]] in the reef allow small boats access to the island.<ref>{{cite web|page=234|url=http://www.sprep.org/att/IRC/eCOPIES/Countries/Nauru/11.pdf|author=Thaman, RR; Hassall, DC|publisher=South Pacific Regional Environment Programme|title=Nauru: National Environmental Management Strategy and National Environmental Action Plan}}</ref> A fertile coastal strip {{convert|150|to|300|m|ft}} wide lies inland from the beach.<ref name=state/>

Coral cliffs surround Nauru's central plateau. The highest point of the plateau, called the [[Command Ridge]], is {{convert|71|m|ft}} above sea level.<ref>{{cite book|title=Geology and hydrogeology of carbonate islands|year=1997 |publisher=Elsevier |isbn=978-0-444-81520-0 |editors=Vacher, H Leonard; Quinn, Terrence M|chapter=24: Geology and Hydrogeology of Nauru Island|author=Jacobson, Gerry; Hill, Peter J; Ghassemi, Fereidoun|page=716}}</ref> The only fertile areas on Nauru are on the narrow coastal belt, where [[coconut palm]]s flourish. The land surrounding [[Buada Lagoon]] supports bananas, [[pineapple]]s, vegetables, [[Pandanus tectorius|pandanus trees]], and indigenous hardwoods such as the [[Calophyllum inophyllum|tomano tree]].<ref name=state/>

Nauru was one of three great [[guano|phosphate rock]] islands in the Pacific Ocean (the others were [[Banaba]] (Ocean Island) in [[Kiribati]] and [[Makatea]] in [[French Polynesia]]). The phosphate reserves on Nauru are now almost entirely depleted. Phosphate mining in the central plateau has left a barren terrain of jagged limestone pinnacles up to {{convert|15|m|ft}} high. Mining has stripped and devastated about 80&nbsp;per cent of Nauru's land area, and has also affected the surrounding [[Exclusive Economic Zone]]; 40&nbsp;per cent of marine life is estimated to have been killed by silt and phosphate runoff.<ref name=state/><ref name = UNCCC>{{cite web|author=Republic of Nauru|year=1999|url=http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/natc/naunc1.pdf|title=Climate Change&nbsp;<U+2013> Response|work=First National Communication|publisher=United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change|accessdate=9 September 2009}}</ref>

There are limited natural fresh water resources on Nauru. Rooftop [[rainwater tank|storage tanks]] collect rainwater, but the islanders are mostly dependent on three [[Desalination|desalination plants]] housed at Nauru's Utilities Agency. Nauru's climate is hot and very humid year-round because of its proximity to the equator and the ocean. Nauru is hit by [[monsoon]] rains between November and February, but does not typically experience cyclones. Annual rainfall is highly variable and is influenced by the [[El Ni<U+00F1>o-Southern Oscillation]], with several significant recorded droughts.<ref name = "UNCCD"/><ref>{{cite book|title=Affaire de certaines terres <U+00E0> phosphates <U+00E0> Nauru|year=2003|publisher=International Court of Justice|isbn=978-92-1-070936-1|pages=107<U+2013>109}}</ref> The temperature on Nauru ranges between {{convert|26|and|35|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F}} during the day and between {{convert|22|and|34|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F}} at night.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cawcr.gov.au/projects/PCCSP/pdf/6._Nauru_GH_poster.pdf|title=Pacific Climate Change Science Program |accessdate=10 June 2012|publisher=Government of Australia}}{{dead link|date=January 2014}}</ref>
