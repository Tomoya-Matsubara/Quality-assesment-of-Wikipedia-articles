'''[[Vanuatu]]''' competed at the  '''[[2008 Summer Olympics]]''' in [[Beijing]], [[China]]. A total of three Vanuatuan athletes competed in two sports. [[Moses Kamut]] and [[Elis Lapenmal]] competed in, respectively, the men's and women's 100m sprints, and [[Priscilla Tommy]] competed in women's singles table tennis after being selected by the [[IOC]]'s Tripartite Commission. Tommy's appearance in particular was Vanuatu's debut into table tennis. Tommy was also the country's flagbearer during the opening ceremony. The Vanuatuan delegation to Beijing included the country's head of state and prime minister, but only included Elis Lapenmal; the other two athletes did not accompany the delegation and arrived in China at different times.

None of the three Vanuatuan Olympians progressed past the first round in their events, and thus did not earn any medals.

==Background==
[[Vanuatu at the Olympics|Vanuatu has participated]] in the Olympics since the [[1988 Summer Olympics]] in Seoul, South Korea; its Olympic committee (VASANOC) was founded a year earlier. Vanuatu's appearance at the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, thus, marked its sixth appearance in the summer Olympics. Although Vanuatu's earlier Olympic appearances were primarily characterized by people participating in athletics (with the exception of the [[2000 Summer Olympics]], which included an archer), the 2008 Vanuatu team involved the country's debut in Olympic table tennis.<ref name=Vanpost /> Other Vanuatuans attempted Olympic qualification competitions in girl's beach volleyball, men's football, and taekwondo, but did not succeed.<ref name=report />

Vanuatu's delegation left for Beijing on August 4th; the delegation encompassed one of the three Olympians, as well as coaches Denison Tari, Sun Hongyi, and Anolyn Lulu; VASANOC president Joe Carlo; and VASANOC secretary general Seru Korikalo. Vanuatuan dignitaries, including the head of state, prime minister, and the minister of sports, also accompanied the team to attend the opening ceremony on August 8th. Table tennis player [[Priscila Tommy]] and athlete [[Moses Kamut]], the other two Vanuatuan qualifiers, did not accompany the Vanuatuan delegation to Beijing. Tommy arrived in China early for training, while Kamut spent time in Belgium.<ref name=CN /> 

Of the participating Olympians, table tennis player Priscila Tommy was the youngest, at age 17. Moses Kamut, at age 26, was the oldest. Kamut and [[Elis Lapenmal]] participated in athletics, and Tommy participated as the team's only table tennis player. There were no medalists from Vanuatu during these Olympic Games.<ref name=S-R />

Priscila Tommy was Vanuatu's flag bearer in the opening ceremony.<ref name=Corridor />

Within the first heat, Kamut placed 7th out of 8, beating [[Francis Manioru]] of the Solomon Islands by 0.28&nbsp;seconds, but falling behind Jamaica's [[Usain Bolt]] by 0.61&nbsp;seconds. Bolt ranked first in Kamut' heat. Overall, Moses Kamut ranked 61st out of 80 out of all the heats run on that day, and did not advance to the next round.<ref name=256ESPN /> Kamut received financial assistance through the Beijing Scholarship, which terminated after the Beijing Olympics ended.<ref name=report />

Elis Lapenmal was Vanuatu's sole participant in the women's 100m dash. She took part in the first round of the event on August 15, in which she was placed in heat three versus athletes that included the United States' [[Muna Lee]]; Saint Kitts and Nevis' [[Virgil Hodge]]; and Mauritania's [[Bounkou Camara]]. Lapenmal ran the 100m in 13.31&nbsp;seconds, placing eighth in a heat of nine people, just ahead of Camara, who scored 13.69&nbsp;seconds. Muna Lee scored first in Lapenmal's heat with a time of 11.33&nbsp;seconds. Overall, Lapenmal tied Guam's [[Cora Alicto]] for 76th place out of 85, and did not advance to the second round on August 16.<ref name=302ESPN />
