==Career==
===Early career: 2002<U+2013>2006===
Curtis won the [[Popstar Magazine]] and [[Johnny Wright (music manager)|Johnny Wright]]<U+2019>s <U+201C>Get Famous<U+201D> contest,<ref>[http://boyculture.typepad.com/boy_culture/2010/04/simon-fights-like-a-robot.html boy culture: Heartbeeps: A Review of 8Bit Heart by Simon Curtis] ''boy culture'' - April 5, 2010 - Retrieved April 22, 2010.</ref> was named a national top ten finalist in the <U+201C>Britney Spears Samsung Superstar Tour,<U+201D> was commissioned by [[Disney]] to provide a theme song for an annual Disneyland event, was named an official Oklahoma Ambassador of Music, and won The [[University of Tulsa]] Award for Outstanding Achievement in Performance.

After years of performing in at least seven professional-level operas or musicals a year, Curtis had shifted his sights to the realm of [[pop music]]. Inspired by the current pop sensations [[Britney Spears]] and [[*NSYNC]], he decided to record his first demo. At fifteen years old, Curtis completed his first set of recordings and began to shop them around. It was his encounter with managers [[Matthew Knowles]] and [[Laila Bagge]] later that summer that changed him forever though. After meeting with them and singing for them, Curtis presented the two managers with his demo, and much to his dismay, was told that although he had stage presence and charisma beyond his years, he sounded like a Broadway kid and wouldn<U+2019>t ever get signed with that kind of sound. Taking their advice, Curtis stopped performing in musicals altogether, began the process of breaking his voice down, and started to find one of his own.

At sixteen, Curtis met local producer Jadion, who offered Curtis his business card after watching him win the Britney Spears Superstar Karaoke tour in Tulsa. A few months later, Curtis finally felt he was ready to tackle the recording studio again, this time with a fresh approach, and contacted the producer. The producer<U+2019>s fresh, Swedish-pop sound pleased Curtis and they soon began the process of recording his new demo. This was Curtis' first time to watch songs he had written himself come to fruition, and he soon became addicted to the process.

A few months before his nineteenth birthday, Curtis grew weary of pursuing his dream via phone and mail, and decided to accept the invitation his producer extended to live with him and his wife who had recently moved to Los Angeles. He packed his bags and drove, by himself, across the country to the bright lights of LA.

At 20, Curtis found his own voice in the tiny apartment recording studio with Jadion. There they began the sessions that would ultimately result in Curtis' upcoming, independent, debut album ''[[Alter Boy EP|Alter Boy <nowiki>[EP]</nowiki>]]''. Recently, Curtis and Jadion were commissioned by Disney to deliver a theme song for the annual Disneyland Resort event, Flashback, which later became a charity single benefiting the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society of America.

===2009<U+2013>present===
Curtis made his film debut when he landed the role of Royce Du Lac on [[Nickelodeon (TV channel)|Nickelodeon]]'s musical TV movie ''[[Spectacular!]]'' in 2009.

In late 2009, Curtis once again began to work on his musical career. He once again teamed up with friend producer Jeff "Jadion" Wells and in a time-span of about thirteen days, he wrote and recorded ''[[8Bit Heart]]''. He chose to release the album for free on his official website after meeting the goal of eight thousand followers on his [[Twitter]] profile. The album was well received by the pop community and was downloaded over 150,000 times in the two weeks following its release. Curtis has managed to do all this without the help of a manager or record label. He is currently hoping to get signed very soon and is promoting his album to various music blogs. He also recently landed a job as the opening act of [[Backstreet Boys]] member AJ McLean on May 6, 2010 at the [[Roxy Theatre]] in West Hollywood, California. Curtis has recently stated on his twitter that he is recording his 2nd album, a follow up to 8Bit Heart
