'''Saline County''' is a [[County (US)|county]] located in west central [[Missouri]]. As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], the population was 23,370.<ref name="QF">{{cite web|title=State & County QuickFacts|url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/29/29195.html|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=September 14, 2013}}</ref> Its [[county seat]] is [[Marshall, Missouri|Marshall]]{{GR|6}}. The county was established November 25, 1820, and named for the region's salt springs.

==History==
Saline County was formed by European-American settlers on November 25, 1820, and was named after the salt mines found in the region. Historically Saline County was occupied for thousands of years by succeeding cultures of [[Missouria|Missouri Native Americans]]. They were relocated to reservations following European-American settlement.  

Saline County was settled primarily by migrants from the [[Upper South]]ern states of [[Kentucky]], [[Tennessee]] and [[Virginia]]. They quickly started cultivating crops similar to those in [[Middle Tennessee]] and Kentucky: [[hemp]] and [[tobacco]]. The counties settled by southerners were known as "[[Little Dixie (Missouri)|Little Dixie]]."  By the time of the Civil War, one-third of the county population was [[African American]], most of whom were [[slavery|enslaved]] laborers on major [[plantations]], particularly for labor-intensive tobacco cultivation.

==Geography==
According to the 2000 U.S. Census, the county has a total area of {{convert|764.59|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|755.55|sqmi}} (or 98.82%) is land and {{convert|9.04|sqmi}} (or 1.18%) is water.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/docs/gazetteer/counties_list_29.txt|title=Census 2010 Gazetteer Files|accessdate=July 2, 2013}}</ref>
