'''Thi<U+1EC1>n Buddhism''' (<U+79AA><U+5B97> Thi<U+1EC1>n T<U+00F4>ng) is the [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] name for the [[Zen]] school of [[Buddhism]]. Thi<U+1EC1>n is ultimately derived from Chinese ''[[Chinese Ch<U+00E1>n|Ch<U+00E1>n]] Z<U+014D>ng'' (<U+79AA><U+5B97>).

==History==
According to traditional accounts of Vietnam, in 580, an [[India]]n monk named [[Vin<U+012B>taruci]] ({{lang-vi|T<U+00EC>-ni-<U+0111>a-l<U+01B0>u-chi}}) traveled to Vietnam after completing his studies with [[Sengcan]], the third patriarch of [[Chinese Ch<U+00E1>n]]. This, then, would be the first appearance of Vietnamese Thi<U+1EC1>n Buddhism.

The sect that Vin<U+012B>taruci and his lone Vietnamese disciple founded would become known as the oldest branch of Thi<U+1EC1>n. After a period of obscurity, the Vin<U+012B>taruci School became one of the most influential Buddhist groups in Vietnam by the 10th century, particularly so under the patriarch [[V<U+1EA1>n-H<U+1EA1>nh]] (died 1018).

Other early Vietnamese Thi<U+1EC1>n schools included that of [[Wu Yantong]], called V<U+00F4> Ng<U+00F4>n Th<U+00F4>ng in Vietnamese, which was associated with the teaching of [[Mazu Daoyi]], and the [[Th<U+1EA3>o <U+0110><U+01B0><U+1EDD>ng]], which incorporated ''[[nianfo]]'' chanting techniques; both were founded by Chinese monks. A new school was founded by one of Vietnam's religious kings; this was the [[Tr<U+00FA>c L<U+00E2>m]] school, which evinced a deep influence from [[Confucianism|Confucian]] and [[Taoism|Taoist]] philosophy. Nevertheless, Tr<U+00FA>c L<U+00E2>m's prestige waned over the following centuries as Confucianism became dominant in the royal court.

In the 17th century, a group of Chinese monks led by Nguy<U+00EA>n Thi<U+1EC1>u established a vigorous new school, the [[L<U+00E2>m T<U+1EBF>]], which is the Vietnamese pronunciation of ''[[Linji school|Linji]]''. A more domesticated offshoot of L<U+00E2>m T<U+1EBF>, the [[Li<U+1EC5>u Qu<U+00E1>n]] school, was founded in the 18th century and has since been the predominant branch of Vietnamese Thi<U+1EC1>n.

Thi<U+1EC1>n master [[Th<U+00ED>ch Thanh T<U+1EEB>]] is credited for renovating Tr<U+00FA>c L<U+00E2>m in [[Vietnam]].  He is one of the most prominent and influential Thi<U+1EC1>n masters currently alive. He was a disciple of Master [[Th<U+00ED>ch Thi<U+1EC7>n Hoa]].

The most famous practitioner of syncretized Thi<U+1EC1>n Buddhism in the West is [[Th<U+00ED>ch Nh<U+1EA5>t H<U+1EA1>nh]] who has authored dozens of books and founded Dharma center [[Plum Village]] in France together with his colleague, Thi<U+1EC1>n Master [[bhikkhuni]] [[Ch<U+00E2>n Kh<U+00F4>ng]].
