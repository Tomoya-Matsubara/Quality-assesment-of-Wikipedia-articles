== Family ==

Octavio (Tav) Salati was born to [[Armando Salati]] and Julia LaFazia in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]]. Tav married Marie Pattani (1919-2010) and they had three children.

== Career ==

Tav Salati received his Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering from the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in 1936. Following graduation, he was employed by [[Philco]] Radio and Television Company, [[Radio Corporation of America]], [[C.G. Conn Ltd.]], and [[Hazeltine Corporation]]. Tav returned to the [[Moore School of Electrical Engineering]] as a research associate in 1948, received his PhD from the University of Pennsylvania in 1963, and became professor of electrical engineering in 1975. Dr. Salati was made a Fellow of the [[IEEE]] in 1975, and he retired from Penn in 1984.<ref name="penn">[http://www.upenn.edu/almanac/v47/n26/deaths.html  University of Pennsylvania article for Octavio Salati]</ref>

== Role in BNC connector development ==

While working at Hazeltine Corporation, Dr. Salati was awarded United States patent #2,540,012 which was the basis for what is now commonly known as the [[BNC connector]].<ref name="penn"></ref> The patent for '''Electrical Connector''' was filed May 19, 1945, and issued January 30, 1951.<ref name="patent">[http://www.google.com/patents/US2540012  '''Electrical Connector''', United States patent #2,540,012]</ref> BNC is an [[acronym]] for Bayonet Neill-Concelman. The BNC connector is still in common use for [[coaxial cables]] that carry high frequency currents between pieces of electronics and communications equipment.<ref name="bnc">[http://www.tech-faq.com/bnc-connector.html  Tech-FAQ, BNC connector article]</ref> Canadian patent #487446 was also awarded to Dr. Salati for this invention on October 21, 1952.<ref name="canada">[http://brevets-patents.ic.gc.ca/opic-cipo/cpd/eng/patent/487446/summary.html  '''Electrical Connector'''.

Reviewers, please see [[BNC connector]]. As Paul Neill and Carl Concelman have Wikipedia stubs, it would seem appropriate for the patent holder to be recognized in a similar manner. Thank you ! [[User:Eyeze|Eyeze]] ([[User talk:Eyeze|talk]]) 02:36, 24 June 2013 (UTC)
