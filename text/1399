'''John Sherman Cooper''' (August 23, 1901&nbsp;<U+2013> February 21, 1991) was a politician, jurist, and diplomat from the [[U.S. state]] of [[Kentucky]]. He served three non-consecutive, partial terms in the [[United States Senate]] before being elected to two full terms in 1960 and 1966. He also served as [[United States Ambassador to India|U.S. Ambassador to India]] from 1955 to 1956 and [[United States Ambassador to East Germany|U.S. Ambassador to East Germany]] from 1974 to 1976. He was the first [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] to be [[popular election|popularly elected]] to more than one term as a senator from Kentucky and, in both 1960 and 1966, he set records for the largest victory margin for a Kentucky senatorial candidate from either party.

Cooper's first political service was as a member of the [[Kentucky House of Representatives]] from 1927 to 1929. In 1930, he was elected [[county judge]] of [[Pulaski County, Kentucky|Pulaski County]]. After a failed gubernatorial bid in 1939, he joined the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] in 1942. During [[World War II]], he earned the [[Bronze Star Medal]] for reorganizing the [[Bavaria]]n judicial system after the [[Victory in Europe Day|allied victory in Europe]]. While still in Germany, he was elected [[Kentucky Circuit Courts|circuit judge]] for Kentucky's 28th district. He returned home to accept the judgeship, which he held for less than a year before resigning to seek election to [[Happy Chandler|A. B. "Happy" Chandler]]'s vacated seat in the U.S. Senate. He won the seat by 41,823 votes, the largest victory margin by any Republican for any office in Kentucky up to that time.

During his first term in the Senate, Cooper voted with the majority of his party just 51% of the time. He was defeated in his re-election bid in 1948, after which he accepted an appointment by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Harry S. Truman]] as a delegate to the [[United Nations General Assembly]] and served as a special assistant to [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Dean Acheson]] during the formation of the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO). Cooper was again elected to a partial term in the Senate in 1952. The popular Cooper appeared likely to be re-elected in 1954 until the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] nominated former Vice-President [[Alben W. Barkley]]. Cooper lost the general election and was appointed Ambassador to India by President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] in 1955. Cooper gained the confidence of [[Prime Minister of India|Indian Prime Minister]] [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] and dramatically improved relations between the U.S. and the recently independent state of [[India]], helping rebuff [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] hopes of expanding [[communism]] in Asia. Barkley died in 1956, and Eisenhower requested that Cooper seek Barkley's open seat. Cooper reluctantly acquiesced and was elected to serve the rest of Barkley's term.

In 1960, Cooper was re-elected, securing his first full, six-year term in the Senate. Newly elected President [[John F. Kennedy]]&nbsp;<U+2013> Cooper's former Senate colleague&nbsp;<U+2013> chose Cooper to conduct a secret fact-finding mission to [[Moscow]] and [[New Delhi]]. Following [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|Kennedy's assassination]] in November 1963, President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] appointed Cooper to the [[Warren Commission]] to investigate the assassination. Cooper soon became an outspoken opponent of Johnson's decision to escalate U.S. military involvement in the [[Vietnam War]], consistently advocating negotiation with the [[North Vietnam]]ese instead. After Cooper's re-election in 1966, he worked with [[Idaho]] Democrat [[Frank Church]] on [[Cooper-Church Amendment|a series of amendments]] designed to de-fund further U.S. military operations in the region. These amendments were hailed as the first serious attempt by [[United States Congress|Congress]] to curb presidential authority over military operations during an ongoing war. Aging and increasingly deaf, Cooper did not seek re-election in 1972. His last acts of public service were as Ambassador to East Germany from 1974 to 1976 and as an alternate delegate to the United Nations in 1981. He died in a Washington, D.C. retirement home on February 21, 1991, and was buried in [[Arlington National Cemetery]].

==Early life==
John Sherman Cooper was born August 23, 1901, in [[Somerset, Kentucky]].<ref name=congbio>"Cooper, John Sherman". ''Biographical Directory of the United States Congress''</ref> He was the second child and first son of seven children born to John Sherman and Helen Gertrude (Tartar) Cooper.<ref name=schulman16>Schulman, p. 16</ref> The Cooper family had been prominent in the Somerset area since brothers Malachi and Edward Cooper migrated from [[South Carolina]] along the [[Wilderness Trail]] and through the [[Cumberland Gap]] around 1790, shortly after [[Daniel Boone]].<ref name=schulman15>Schulman, p. 15</ref> His father's parents&nbsp;&ndash; staunch [[Baptist]]s&nbsp;&ndash; were active in the [[Abolitionism|anti-slavery movement]] in the nineteenth century, and the elder John Sherman Cooper (called "Sherman") was named after the [[John the Apostle|Apostle John]] and [[William Tecumseh Sherman]], a hero of the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] in the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].<ref name=smoot134>Smoot, p. 134</ref> The family was very active in local politics; six of Cooper's ancestors, including his father, were elected [[county judge]]s in [[Pulaski County, Kentucky|Pulaski County]], and two had been [[Kentucky Circuit Courts|circuit judges]].<ref name=time>"Whittledycut". ''Time''</ref> Sherman Cooper engaged in numerous successful business ventures and was known as the wealthiest man in Somerset.<ref name=krebs>Krebs, "John Sherman Cooper Dies at 89"</ref><ref name=finch162>Finch, p. 162</ref> At the time of John Sherman Cooper's birth, his father was serving as collector of internal revenue in [[Kentucky's 8th congressional district]], a position to which he had been appointed by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Theodore Roosevelt]].<ref name=smoot135>Smoot, p. 135</ref>

During his youth, Cooper worked delivering newspapers, in railroad yards, and in his father's coal mines in [[Harlan County, Kentucky|Harlan County]].<ref name=mourn>Hewlett and Merrit, "John Sherman Cooper Dies at 89"</ref> Despite having formerly served as county school superintendent, Cooper's father had a low opinion of the [[State school|public schools]], and until he was in the [[fifth grade]], Cooper was privately tutored by a neighbor.<ref name=smoot135 /><ref name=schulman17>Schulman, p. 17</ref> While his father was away on business in [[Texas]], his mother sent him to sixth grade at the public school, which he attended thereafter.<ref name=time /> At [[Somerset High School (Kentucky)|Somerset High School]], he played both basketball and football.<ref name=mourn /> After the outbreak of [[World War I]], Cooper joined an informal military training unit at the high school.<ref name=smoot144>Smoot, p. 144</ref> Two of the school's instructors organized the boys into two [[Company (military unit)|companies]], but Cooper, who was given the rank of captain, later recalled that "they taught us how to march and that's about all."<ref name=smoot144 /> During his senior year, Cooper served as class president and class poet.<ref name=mourn /> In 1918, he graduated second in his high school class and was chosen to give the [[commencement speech]].<ref name=time /><ref name=mourn />

After graduation, Cooper matriculated at [[Centre College]] in [[Danville, Kentucky]].<ref name=cooper227>Cooper, p. 227</ref> While at Centre, Cooper was accepted into the [[Beta Theta Pi]] fraternity.<ref name=btp>Howard, "John Sherman Cooper"</ref> He also played [[defensive end]] on the [[Centre Praying Colonels football|Praying Colonels' football team]].<ref name=smoot146>Smoot, p. 146</ref> Cooper was a [[Letterman (sports)|letterman]] on the team, playing alongside football notables [[Bo McMillan]], [[Red Roberts]], [[Matty Bell]], and [[Red Weaver]].<ref name=smoot146 /> Another member of the team, [[John Y. Brown, Sr.]], would later become one of Cooper's political rivals.<ref name=smoot146 /> Coached by [[Charley Moran]], the team was undefeated in four games in the 1918 season, which was shortened by [[1918 flu pandemic|an outbreak of the Spanish flu]].<ref name=smoot146 />

Although Centre was known as one of Kentucky's foremost colleges, Cooper's father wanted him to broaden his education and, after one year at Centre, Cooper transferred to [[Yale College]], a nationally-renowned college in [[New Haven, Connecticut]].<ref name=schulman19>Schulman, p. 19</ref> At Yale, he was a classmate of his future U.S. Senate colleague, [[Stuart Symington]].<ref name=schulman19 /> Cooper was active in many extracurricular activities at Yale, including the Sophomore German Committee, the Junior [[Prom]]enade Committee, the [[Student council|Student Council]], the Class Day Committee, the Southern Club, the University Club, and Beta Theta Pi.<ref name=smoot151>Smoot, p. 151</ref> A member of the Undergraduate Athletic Association, he played football and basketball, becoming the first person in Yale history to be named [[Captain (sports)|captain]] of the basketball team in his junior and senior years.<ref name=mourn /> In his senior year, he was accepted into the elite [[Skull and Bones]] society but regretted not being accepted into [[Phi Beta Kappa]].<ref name=schulman19 /> Upon graduation, he was voted most popular and most likely to succeed in his class.<ref name=btp />

Cooper earned a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree from Yale in 1923 and enrolled at [[Harvard Law School]] later that year.<ref name=cooper227 /> During the summer break of 1924, he returned to Kentucky, where his father, dying of [[Bright's disease]], told him that he would soon become the head of the family, and that most of the family's resources had been lost in the [[Depression of 1920<U+2013>21|economic recession of the early 1920s]].<ref name=time /><ref name=smoot154>Smoot, p. 154</ref> Cooper returned to Harvard after his father's death, but soon discovered that he could not simultaneously pursue a law degree and manage his family's affairs.<ref name=time /> He was [[Admission to the bar in the United States|admitted to the bar]] by examination in 1928 and opened a legal practice in Somerset.<ref name=congbio /> Over the next 20 years, he sold his father's remaining assets, paid off the family debts, and financed a college education for his six siblings.<ref name=krebs />

==Early political career==
After being urged into politics by his uncle, Judge Roscoe Tartar, Cooper ran unopposed for a seat in the [[Kentucky House of Representatives]] as a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] in 1927.<ref name=mourn /> As a member of the House, he was one of only three Republicans to oppose Republican [[Governor of Kentucky|Governor]] [[Flem D. Sampson]]'s unsuccessful attempt to politicize the state department of health; the measure failed by a single vote.<ref name=cooper227 /><ref name=schulman21>Schulman, p. 21</ref> Cooper supported the governor's plan to provide free textbooks for the state's school children and sponsored legislation to prohibit judges from issuing [[injunction]]s to end labor strikes, although the latter bill did not pass.<ref name=mourn /><ref name=cooper227 />

In 1929, Cooper declared his candidacy for county judge of Pulaski County.<ref name=schulman22>Schulman, p. 22</ref> His opponent, the incumbent, was the president of Somerset Bank and the former law partner of Cooper's father.<ref name="schulman22" /> Cooper won the election, however, beginning the first of his eight years as county judge.<ref name="schulman22" /> During his service, he was required by law to enforce [[eviction]] notices, but often helped those he evicted find other housing or gave them money himself, earning him the nickname "the poor man's judge".<ref name=mourn /> He reportedly became so depressed by the poverty and suffering of his constituents during the [[Great Depression]] that he had a [[nervous breakdown]] and took a leave of absence to seek psychiatric treatment.<ref name=mourn />

Cooper served on the board of trustees for the [[University of Kentucky]] from 1935 to 1946.<ref name=congbio /> In 1939, he sought the Republican gubernatorial nomination.<ref name=cooper227 /> As a result of a mandatory [[primary election]] law passed in 1935, the Republican nominee would not be chosen by a [[political convention|nominating convention]], as was typical for the party.<ref name=finch162 /> Cooper garnered only 36% of the vote in the primary, losing the nomination to [[King Swope]], a [[Lexington, Kentucky|Lexington]] circuit court judge and former [[United States House of Representatives|congressman]].<ref name=finch162 />

==Service in World War II==
Although well above [[Conscription in the United States|the draft age]] at 41 years old, Cooper enlisted for service in the [[United States Army]] in World War II in 1942.<ref name=congbio /> Immediately offered an officer's commission, he chose instead to enlist as a [[Private (rank)|private]].<ref name=schulman26>Schulman, p. 26</ref> After basic training, he enrolled in [[Officer Candidate School (U.S. Army)|Officer Candidate School]] at the [[Fort Custer Training Center]] in [[Michigan]].<ref name=mourn /> He studied [[military government]] and graduated second in his class of 111 students.<ref name=krebs /><ref name=finch163>Finch, p. 163</ref> In 1943, he was commissioned a [[second lieutenant]] and assigned to the [[XV Corps (United States)|XV Corps]] of General [[George Patton]]'s [[United States Army Central|Third Army]] as a courier in the military police.<ref name=schulman28>Schulman, p. 28</ref> Cooper served in France, Luxembourg, and Germany.<ref name=cooper227 /> After liberating the [[Buchenwald concentration camp]], Patton ordered the entire population of the nearby city of [[Weimar]] to go through it and observe the conditions; Cooper also viewed the camp at that time.<ref name=schulman31>Schulman, p. 31</ref>

Following the cessation of hostilities, Cooper served as a legal advisor for the 300,000 [[displaced persons]] in his unit's occupation zone seeking repatriation after being brought to Germany as slaves by the Nazis.<ref name=mourn /> Under the terms of the agreement reached at the [[Yalta Conference]], all displaced Russian nationals were to be returned to the [[Soviet Union]], but Soviet negotiators decided that the agreement did not apply to non-Russian spouses and children of the nationals.<ref name=mourn /> Cooper brought this to the attention of General Patton, who rescinded the repatriation order in the Third Army's occupation zone.<ref name=mourn /> Cooper received a citation from the Third Army's military government section for his action.<ref name=schulman32>Schulman, p. 32</ref> Cooper also oversaw the reorganization of the 239 courts in the German state of [[Bavaria]] in an attempt to replace all the [[Nazi]] officials, for which he was awarded the [[Bronze Star Medal]].<ref name=mourn /> Among the judges installed by Cooper were [[Wilhelm Hoegner]], future [[Minister-President]] of Bavaria, and [[Ludwig Erhard]], the future [[Chancellor of Germany]].<ref name=schulman33>Schulman, p. 33</ref>

In 1943 or 1944, while he was still in the Army, Cooper married a nurse named Evelyn Pfaff.<ref name=krebs /><ref name=cooper227 /> Cooper was elected without opposition as circuit judge of Kentucky's twenty-eighth judicial district in 1945, despite still being in Germany and not campaigning for the office.<ref name=mourn /> He was discharged from the Army with the rank of [[Captain (U.S. Army)|captain]] in February 1946 and returned to Kentucky to assume the judgeship.<ref name=finch163 />

==First term in the Senate and early diplomatic career==
Cooper's judicial district included his native Pulaski County, as well as [[Rockcastle County, Kentucky|Rockcastle]], [[Wayne County, Kentucky|Wayne]] and [[Clinton County, Kentucky|Clinton]] counties.<ref name=mourn /> During his tenure, [[African-American|blacks]] were allowed to serve on trial juries in the district for the first time.<ref name=cooper227 /> Of the first 16 [[judicial opinion|opinions]] he issued during his time on the bench, 15 were upheld by the [[Kentucky Court of Appeals]], Kentucky's [[court of last resort]] at the time.<ref name=schluman34>Schluman, p. 34</ref>

[[File:Happy Chandler - Harris and Ewing Crop.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A man with black hair wearing a white shirt, black pinstriped jacket, and patterned tie|Senator Happy Chandler's resignation to become Baseball Commissioner prompted Cooper's first run for the U.S. Senate.]]
Cooper resigned his judgeship in November 1946 to seek the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] seat vacated when [[Happy Chandler|A. B. "Happy" Chandler]] resigned to accept the position of [[Commissioner of Baseball]].<ref name=cooper227 /> Cooper's opponent, former Congressman and [[Speaker of the Kentucky House of Representatives]] John Y. Brown, Sr., was better known and widely believed to be the favorite in the race.<ref name=finch163 /> However, Brown had alienated Chandler's supporters in the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] during a hotly contested senatorial primary between Brown and Chandler in 1942, and this group worked against his election in 1946.<ref name=finch163 /> Further, the ''[[Louisville Courier-Journal]]'' opposed Brown because of his attacks on former Senator [[J. C. W. Beckham]] and Judge [[Robert Worth Bingham]], who were heads of a powerful [[political machine]] in [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]].<ref name=finch163 /> With these two factors working against Brown, Cooper won the election to fill Chandler's unexpired term by 41,823 votes, the largest victory margin by any Republican for any office in Kentucky up to that time.<ref name=cooper227 /><ref name=finch163 /> His victory marked only the third time in Kentucky's history that a Republican had been [[popular election|popularly elected]] to the Senate.<ref name=finch161 /> The move to Washington D.C. proved to be too much for Cooper's already strained marriage.<ref name=schulman67>Schulman, p. 67</ref> In 1947, he filed for divorce, charging abandonment.<ref name=mourn />

Cooper described himself as "a truly terrible public speaker" and rarely made addresses from the Senate floor.<ref name=krebs /> He was known as an independent Republican during his career in the Senate.<ref name=krebs /> In the first [[Recorded vote|roll-call vote]] of his career, he opposed transferring investigatory powers to Republican [[Owen Brewster]]'s special [[Senate War Investigating Committee|War Investigating Committee]].<ref name=time /> His second vote, directing that proceeds from the sale of [[Military surplus|war surplus]] materiel be used to pay off war debts, also went against the majority of the Republican caucus, prompting [[Ohio]] Republican [[Robert A. Taft]] to ask him "Are you a Republican or a Democrat? When are you going to start voting with us?"<ref name=schulman37>Schluman, p. 37</ref> Cooper responded, "If you'll pardon me, I was sent here to represent my constituents, and I intend to vote as I think best."<ref name=krebs />

A few days after being sworn in, Cooper co-sponsored his first piece of legislation, a bill to provide federal aid for education.<ref name=mourn /> The bill passed the Senate, but not the House.<ref name=mourn /> Cooper was made chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Public Roads, and helped draft a bill authorizing $900&nbsp;million in federal funds to states for highway construction.<ref name=mourn /> In 1948, he sponsored a bill to provide [[price support]] for [[burley tobacco]] at 90 percent of parity.<ref name=cooper227 /> He insisted on an amendment to the [[War Claims Act of 1948]] that benefits to veterans injured as prisoners of war of the Germans and Japanese during World War II be paid immediately using enemy assets.<ref name=mourn /> He also co-sponsored legislation allowing hundreds of thousands of people displaced by the Nazis to enter the United States legally.<ref name=mourn /> He opposed bans on industrywide [[collective bargaining]] for [[organized labor]] and on the establishment of [[closed shop]]s.<ref name=mourn /> He voted against putting [[trade union|union]] welfare funds under government control, but helped to pass an amendment forbidding compulsory union membership for workers.<ref name=mourn />

Cooper continued his independence from his party throughout his term, vocally opposing Republican plans to cut taxes despite record national budget deficits and resisting the party's efforts to reduce funding for the [[Marshall Plan]] to rebuild Europe in the aftermath of the war.<ref name=mourn /> He worked with fellow Kentuckian [[Alben Barkley]] and [[Oregon]] Senator [[Wayne Morse]] to undermine [[Jim Crow laws]] enacted by the states and remove obstacles to [[suffrage]] for minorities.<ref name=schulman38>Schulman, p. 38</ref> He also co-sponsored a bill to create the [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] system, although it was defeated at the time.<ref name=schulman38 /> Although he had voted with the Republicans just 51% of the time during his partial term&nbsp;<U+2013> the lowest average of any member of the party&nbsp;<U+2013> Cooper headed the Kentucky delegation to the [[1948 Republican National Convention]].<ref name=mourn /><ref name=schulman39>Schulman, p. 39</ref> He supported [[Arthur Vandenberg]] for president, but [[Thomas E. Dewey]] ultimately received the party's nomination.<ref name=schulman39 /> Cooper himself was mentioned as a possible candidate for vice-president, but ultimately did not receive the nomination and sought re-election to his Senate seat instead.<ref name=mourn /> Also in 1948, Centre College awarded Cooper an [[honorary degree|honorary]] [[Doctor of Laws]] degree.<ref name=centre>"John Sherman Cooper: Centre College Class of 1922". ''CentreCyclopedia''</ref>

Cooper was opposed in his re-election bid by Democratic Congressman [[Virgil M. Chapman]], an ally of [[Earle C. Clements]], who had been elected governor in 1947.<ref name=finch164>Finch, p. 164</ref> As one of only a few Democrats who had voted in favor of the [[Taft-Hartley Act]], Chapman had lost the support of organized labor, a key constituency for the Democrats.<ref name=finch164 /> The Democratic-leaning ''[[The Louisville Times|Louisville Times]]'' endorsed Cooper, but the presence of Kentucky's favorite son, Alben Barkley, on the ballot as [[Harry S. Truman]]'s running mate in the [[United States presidential election, 1948|1948 presidential election]] ensured a strong Democratic turnout in the state.<ref name=finch164 /><ref name=schulman41>Schulman, p. 41</ref> Both Barkley and Clements stressed party unity during the campaign, and although Cooper polled much better than the Republican presidential ticket, he ultimately lost to Chapman in the general election by 24,480 votes.<ref>Finch, pp. 164<U+2013>165</ref>

Following his defeat, Cooper resumed the practice of law in the Washington, D.C. firm of Gardner, Morison and Rogers.<ref name=cooper227 /> In 1949, President Truman appointed Cooper as one of five delegates to the [[United Nations General Assembly|United Nations (U.N.) General Assembly]].<ref name=mourn /> He was an alternate delegate to that body in 1950 and 1951.<ref name=cooper227 /> [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Dean Acheson]] chose Cooper as his advisor to meetings that created the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO) and at meetings of the NATO Council of Ministers in London in May 1950 and [[Brussels]] in December 1950.<ref>Schulman, pp. 43, 50<U+2013>51</ref> Political historian Glenn Finch observed that, while Cooper was well-qualified for his duties at the U.N. and NATO, his presence abroad also made him less available to campaign for the Senate seat vacated by Barkley's elevation to the vice-presidency.<ref name=finch165>Finch, p. 165</ref> Speculation was raised that Clements, who won Barkley's old seat in a special election in 1950, may have influenced Truman and Acheson to make the appointments.<ref name=finch165 />

==Second term in the Senate==
Cooper's supporters believed he would again seek the governorship of Kentucky or be appointed to the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] in the early 1950s; some even formed a committee to elect Cooper president.<ref name=mourn /> Cooper considered running for governor in 1951, but when Senator Chapman was killed in an automobile accident on March 8, 1951, he decided to make another run for the Senate against [[Thomas R. Underwood]], Governor [[Lawrence Wetherby]]'s appointee to fill the vacancy.<ref name=finch165 /> Underwood was considered a heavy favorite in the race. Some Republicans faulted Cooper for taking an appointment from Democratic president Harry Truman.<ref name=schulman56>Schulman, p. 56</ref> Both the ''Louisville Times'' and the ''Louisville Courier-Journal'' recanted their statements in 1950 that Cooper should seek election to the Senate in 1954; they now feared that the election of a Republican would allow that party to organize the Senate, giving key committee chairmanships to isolationists opposed to continued U.S. involvement in the [[Korean War]].<ref name=schulman57>Schulman, p. 57</ref> Nevertheless, Cooper defeated Underwood by 29,000 votes in the election to serve out the remainder of Chapman's term.<ref name=finch166>Finch, p. 166</ref> His victory marked the first time in Kentucky's history that a Republican had been elected to the Senate more than once.<ref>Finch, pp. 161, 164</ref>

Cooper was named to the [[United States Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions|Senate Committee on Labor, Education and Public Welfare]] and chaired its education and labor subcommittees.<ref name=mourn /> He sponsored a bill authorizing public works projects along the [[Big Sandy River (Ohio River)|Big Sandy River]], including the [[Tug Fork|Tug]] and [[Levisa Fork|Levisa]] forks.<ref name=mourn /> He also supported the reconstruction of the [[Lock (water transport)|locks and dams]] along the [[Ohio River]] and the construction of locks, dams, and reservoirs in the [[Green River (Kentucky)|Green River]] Valley.<ref name=mourn /> He opposed the [[Dixon-Yates contract]], which would have paid a private company to construct a new power station to generate power for the city of [[Memphis, Tennessee]], calling instead for authorization for the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] to issue bonds to finance the construction of new power stations.<ref name=schulman63>Schulman, p. 63</ref> He supported a comprehensive program benefiting the coal industry and co-sponsored a bill to extending public library services to rural areas.<ref name=mourn />

Cooper continued to be an independent voice in the Senate. During the [[Red Scare]], he was critical of attempts to permit illegal [[Telephone tapping|wiretap]] evidence in federal courts and attempts to reduce the protections against self-incrimination granted by the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]].<ref name=schulman62>Schulman, p. 62</ref> Nevertheless, he refused to support stripping [[Joseph McCarthy]], the leading figure in the Red Scare, of his major Senate committee chairmanships, cautioning that "many of those who bitterly oppose Senator McCarthy call for the same tactics that they charge him with."<ref>Schulman, pp. 62<U+2013>63</ref> He was the only Republican to oppose the [[Bricker Amendment]], which would have limited the president's treaty-making power, because he concluded that the issues addressed by the amendment were not sufficient to warrant a change to the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]].<ref name=schulman60>Schulman, p. 60</ref> He also opposed the [[Submerged Lands Act]] and the Mexican Farm Labor bill, both of which were supported by the [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]] administration.<ref name=schulman64>Schulman, p. 64</ref> He denounced Eisenhower's appointment of [[Albert M. Cole]], an open opponent of [[public housing]], as [[Federal Housing Administration|Federal Housing Administrator]] and opposed many of the agricultural reforms proposed by Eisenhower's Agriculture Secretary, [[Ezra Taft Benson]].<ref name=time /> Again, his independence did little to diminish his stature in the party. In 1954, he was named to the [[Senate Republican Policy Committee]].<ref name=mourn />

Cooper again sought re-election in 1954.<ref name=cooper227 /> Democrats first considered Governor Wetherby as his opponent, but Wetherby's candidacy would have drawn a primary challenger from the Happy Chandler faction of the Democratic Party, possibly leading to a party split and Cooper's re-election.<ref name=finch167>Finch, p. 167</ref> Instead, party leaders convinced outgoing Vice-President Barkley, now 77 years old, to run for the seat in order to ensure party unity.<ref name=finch167 /> There were few policy differences between Barkley and Cooper, who had been deemed the most liberal Republican in the Senate by [[Americans for Democratic Action]].<ref name=finch167 /><ref name=franklin29>Franklin, p. 29</ref> During the campaign, Cooper was featured on the cover of ''Time'' magazine on July 5, 1954.<ref name=mourn /> Cooper appealed to women voters who were concerned about the [[First Indochina War|increasingly tense situation in Southeast Asia]] and to black voters because of his stands in favor of civil rights.<ref name=schluman65>Schulman, p. 65</ref> He also claimed that he would be a less partisan Senator than Barkley.<ref name=schulman66>Schulman, p. 66</ref> Barkley's personal popularity carried him to a 71,000-vote victory, however.<ref name=finch167 /> Glenn Finch opined that "Barkley was unbeatable in his own state, and it is probable that no other candidate could have defeated Cooper."<ref name=finch167 />

==Ambassador to India==
In 1955, President Dwight Eisenhower nominated Cooper as [[United States Ambassador to India|U.S. Ambassador to India and Nepal]].<ref name=cooper227 /> During his time as a delegate for the United Nations, Cooper had met [[Prime Minister of India|Indian Prime Minister]] [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] and established a cordial working relationship with the Indian delegation, including Nehru's sister [[Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit]].<ref name=franklin31>Franklin, p. 31</ref> The Indians had been impressed with Cooper and the Indian government had expressed their desire that Cooper serve as their ambassador from the U.S.<ref name=franklin31 /> Cooper initially rejected the offer of the Indian ambassadorship from Secretary of State [[John Foster Dulles]] but was convinced to accept it by a personal request from President Eisenhower.<ref name=franklin31 /> The Senate confirmed Cooper's nomination on February 4, 1955.<ref name=franklin32>Franklin, p. 32</ref>

India had only become an independent nation in 1948, and it was considered a potential bulwark against Communism in Asia.<ref name=finch167 /> U.S.<U+2013>India relations were strained, however, because of India's recognition of [[People's Republic of China|Communist China]], its opposition to the [[Southeast Asia Treaty Organization]] (SEATO), and its resistance to foreign interference in [[Indochina]].<ref name=finch167 /> ''[[U.S. News and World Report]]'' described the ambassadorship as "one of the most difficult and delicate in all the diplomatic world".<ref name=franklin29 />

Cooper married Lorraine Rowan Shelvin on March 17, 1955, in [[Pasadena, California]], just ten days before leaving for India.<ref name=mourn /><ref name="franklin32" /> Twice divorced, Shelvin was the daughter of a wealthy California real estate developer, step-daughter of [[Vatican City|Vatican]] official Prince Domenico Orsini, and a well-known socialite.<ref name="schulman67" /> She was fluent in three languages and understood Russian.<ref name="franklin32" />  The two had dated for much of the 1950s, but Cooper was hesitant to marry because he had doubts about moving into Shelvin's elaborate [[Georgetown (Washington, D.C.)|Georgetown]] home.<ref name=schulman69>Schulman, p. 69</ref> (While in Washington, the unmarried Cooper permanently resided in the Dodge House Hotel.)<ref name=schulman68>Schulman, p. 68</ref> The move to India removed this barrier, and Secretary of State Dulles encouraged Cooper to marry her before leaving so that the U.S. embassy in New Delhi might have a proper hostess.<ref>Schulman, pp. 68<U+2013>69</ref> On April 4, 1955, the couple stopped in England on their way to India to visit with [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Louis Mountbatten]], the last [[Governor-General of India]] prior to India's achieving its independence.<ref name=franklin33>Franklin, p. 33</ref> Their discussions about the situation of the Indian people were part of the scant preparation Cooper received before arriving there.<ref name=franklin33 />

Cooper began his service as ambassador by developing a close friendship with Prime Minister Nehru.<ref name=franklin34>Franklin, p. 34</ref> Nehru's respect and admiration for Cooper soon became widely known.<ref name=franklin36>Franklin, p. 36</ref> Cooper labored to help officials in Washington, D.C. understand that India's reluctance to align with either the West or the Communists in China and the Soviet Union was their way of exercising their newly won independence.<ref name=franklin37>Franklin, p. 37</ref> At the same time, he defended the U.S. military buildup after World War&nbsp;II, its involvement in the Korean War, and its membership in mutual security pacts like NATO and SEATO as self-defense measures, not aggressive actions by the U.S. government, as the Indians widely perceived them.<ref name=franklin40>Franklin, p. 40</ref> Cooper condemned the Eisenhower administration's decision to sell weapons to [[Pakistan]], which was resented by the Indians, but also felt that the Indian government took some political positions without regard to their moral implications.<ref name=franklin40 /> By late 1955, the ''[[Chicago Daily News]]'' reported that Indo-American relations had "improved to a degree not thought possible six months ago".<ref name=franklin46>Franklin, p. 46</ref>

In a joint communiqu<U+00E9> dated December 2, 1955, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles and [[Portugal|Portuguese]] Foreign Minister Paulo Cunha condemned statements made by [[Premier of the Soviet Union|Soviet Premier]] [[Nikolai Bulganin]] and Soviet Party Chairman [[Nikita Krushchev]] during an eighteen-day tour of India.<ref name="franklin46" /> Of particular interest was the communiqu<U+00E9>'s reference to "Portuguese provinces in the Far East".<ref name=franklin47>Franklin, p. 47</ref> This phrase referred to [[Goa]], a Portuguese colony in western India.<ref name="franklin47" /> Although most European nations with holdings near India had granted them to the new independent nation in 1947, Portugal refused to surrender Goa, and the region had become a source of conflict between the two nations.<ref>Franklin, pp. 42<U+2013>43</ref> The joint communiqu<U+00E9> seemed to indicate U.S. recognition of Portuguese sovereignty in Goa, which undercut Cooper's assurances to the Indians of U.S. neutrality in the matter.<ref name="franklin47" /> Cooper himself did not know about the communiqu<U+00E9> until he read an account of it in the Indian media and was therefore unprepared to offer an explanation for it when asked by the Indian Foreign Secretary.<ref name="franklin47" /> Cooper's cable to Washington, D.C. about the matter was reported to have been "bitter", although the contents of the cable have not been released.<ref name="franklin47" />

The Dulles<U+2013>Cuhna communiqu<U+00E9> touched off anti-American demonstrations in many parts of India.<ref name="franklin47" /> On December 6, Dulles held a news conference during which he reaffirmed U.S. neutrality on the Goa issue, but did not recant claims of Portuguese sovereignty over the region.<ref>Franklin, pp. 48<U+2013>49</ref> Prime Minister Nehru announced his intent to file a formal protest with the United States over the communiqu<U+00E9> and to address the [[Parliament of India|Indian Parliament]] about the matter.<ref name=franklin49>Franklin, p. 49</ref> In the interim, Cooper secured a meeting with Nehru and forestalled both actions.<ref name=franklin50>Franklin, p. 50</ref> Cooper became even more upset with Dulles when Dulles authorized withholding $10&nbsp;million of a $50&nbsp;million aid package to India; Cooper protested the withholding, and Dulles decided to pay the full amount.<ref name=franklin51>Franklin, p. 51</ref>

Throughout the early part of 1956, Cooper strongly advocated that the U.S. respect Indian nonalignment and increase economic aid to the country.<ref name=franklin52>Franklin, p. 52</ref> In August 1956, Congress approved a financial aid package for India that included the largest sale up to that point of surplus agricultural products by the United States to any country.<ref name=franklin53>Franklin, p. 53</ref> Cooper's persistence in requesting such aid was critical in getting the package approved, as it was opposed by many administration officials, including [[Under Secretary of State]] [[Herbert Hoover, Jr.]], [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Treasury Secretary]] [[George M. Humphrey]], and [[International Cooperation Administration]] Director [[John B. Hollister]].<ref name=franklin53 />

==Later service in the Senate==
[[File:Dwight D. Eisenhower, official Presidential portrait.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A balding man with gray hair, seated and holding his eyeglasses in his right hand. He is wearing a black suit, white shirt, and blue tie|President Eisenhower convinced Cooper to return to the U.S. and seek election to the Senate.]]
Senator Barkley died in office on April 30, 1956.<ref name=finch168>Finch, p. 168</ref> Republican leaders encouraged Cooper to return from India and seek the seat, but Cooper was reluctant to give up his ambassadorship.<ref name=finch168 /> After a personal appeal from President Eisenhower, however, Cooper acquiesced and declared his candidacy in July 1956.<ref name=finch168 /> Even after leaving India, he maintained close ties with the country's leaders and was the official U.S. representative at the funerals of Prime Minister Nehru in 1964, Prime Minister [[Lal Bahadur Shastri]] in 1966, and Prime Minister [[Indira Gandhi]] in 1984.<ref name=mourn />

Because Barkley's death occurred after the filing deadline for the November elections, the Democratic State Central Committee had to choose a nominee for the now-open seat.<ref name=finch168 /> After unsuccessfully attempting to find a compromise candidate that both the Clements and Chandler factions could support, they chose Lawrence Wetherby, whose term as governor had recently expired.<ref name=finch168 />  Chandler, now serving his second term as governor, was angered by the choice of Wetherby, and most members of his faction either gave Wetherby lukewarm support or outright supported Cooper instead.<ref name=finch169>Finch, p. 169</ref> This, combined with Cooper's personal popularity, led to his victory over Wetherby by 65,000 votes.<ref name=finch169 />

Upon his return to the Senate in 1957, Cooper was assigned to the [[United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations|Senate Foreign Relations Committee]].<ref name=schulman88>Schulman, p. 88</ref> In 1959, he challenged [[Illinois]] Senator [[Everett Dirksen]] to become the Republican [[floor leader]] in the Senate, but lost by four votes.<ref name=krebs /> In a 1960 poll of fifty journalists conducted by ''[[Newsweek]]'' magazine, Cooper was named the ablest Republican member of the Senate.<ref name=cooper227 /> He helped author and co-sponsored the [[National Defense Education Act]].<ref name=mourn /> Together with Senator [[Jennings Randolph]], he sponsored the [[Appalachian Regional Development Act]], designed to address the prevalent poverty in [[Appalachia]].<ref name=cooper227 /> He succeeded in gaining more state and local control over the anti-poverty group [[Volunteers in Service to America]].<ref name=bluestone113>Bluestone, p. 113</ref> He was a vigorous opponent of measures designed to weaken the Tennessee Valley Authority.<ref name=cooper227 />

In 1960, Democrats nominated former governor [[Keen Johnson]], then an executive with [[Reynolds Metals]], to oppose Cooper's re-election bid.<ref name=finch169 /> Cooper had the support of organized labor and benefitted from a large segment of Kentuckians who voted for Republican [[Richard M. Nixon]] over Democrat [[John F. Kennedy]] as a reaction against Kennedy's [[Catholicism]] in the [[United States presidential election, 1960|1960 presidential election]].<ref name=finch170>Finch, p. 170</ref> Cooper ultimately defeated Johnson by 199,257 votes, a record victory margin for a Kentucky senatorial candidate.<ref>Finch, pp. 161, 170</ref>

Shortly after his election as president in 1960, Kennedy chose Cooper to conduct a then-secret mission to Moscow and New Delhi to assess the attitudes of the Soviet government for the new administration.<ref name=schulman89>Schulman, p. 89</ref> Kennedy and Cooper had served together on the Senate Labor Committee and maintained a social friendship.<ref name=schulman90>Schulman, p. 90</ref> On the mission, Cooper discovered that the Soviets disliked Kennedy and Nixon equally.<ref name=schulman90 /> Cooper concluded in his report to Kennedy that there was little potential for harmonious relations with the Soviets.<ref name=schulman90 /> After meeting with Secretary Khruschev, Kennedy confirmed to Cooper that his report had been correct and confessed that he should have taken it even more seriously.<ref name=schulman90 /> Cooper supported Kennedy's decision to resume nuclear weapons testing after the Soviets resumed their testing in March 1962, but he urged Kennedy to negotiate an agreement with the Soviets if possible.<ref name=logevall243>Logevall, p. 243</ref>

President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] appointed Cooper to the [[Warren Commission]], which was charged with investigating [[assassination of John F. Kennedy|Kennedy's assassination]] in 1963.<ref name=cooper227 /> As one of three Republicans on the [[United States Senate Committee on Rules and Administration|Senate Rules and Administration Committee]], he was involved with the investigation of Johnson aide [[Bobby Baker]] in 1964, which he decried as "a [[Whitewash (censorship)|whitewash]]" after the committee blocked further investigation.<ref name=bluestone113 /> He proposed the establishment of a [[United States Senate Select Committee on Ethics|Senate Select Committee on Standards and Conduct]] in July 1964 and was named to that committee in July 1965.<ref name=bluestone113 /> Also in 1965, he was chosen advisor to the United States delegation to the [[Manila]] Conference that established the [[Asian Development Bank]].<ref name=btp />

An advocate for small businesses and agricultural interests, Cooper opposed an April 1965 bill that expanded the powers of the [[Federal Trade Commission]] to regulate cigarette advertising.<ref name=bluestone113 /> In March 1966, he proposed an amendment to a mine safety bill supported by the [[United Mine Workers of America]] that would have nullified provisions of the bill if they were not shown to contribute to the safety of small mines, but his amendment was defeated.<ref name=bluestone113 />

===Opposition to the Vietnam War===
Although Cooper voted in favor of the 1964 [[Gulf of Tonkin Resolution]], he opposed escalating U.S. involvement in the [[Vietnam War]].<ref name=johns590>Johns, p. 590</ref> As early as April 1964, Cooper was urging President Johnson to negotiate a peaceful settlement to the tensions in Southeast Asia.<ref name=johns588>Johns, p. 588</ref> He questioned Southeast Asia's strategic importance to the U.S. and expressed concerns about the feasibility of deploying the U.S. military on a global scale.<ref name=johns589>Johns, p. 589</ref> On March 25, 1965, he joined New York Senator [[Jacob Javits]] in a call for President Johnson to begin negotiations for a settlement between [[North Vietnam]] and [[South Vietnam]] without imposing preconditions on the negotiations.<ref name=johns591>Johns, p. 591</ref> Later in the day, he introduced resolutions calling for Secretary of State [[Dean Rusk]] and [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] [[Robert McNamara]] to brief the full Senate on recent developments in Vietnam.<ref name=logevall247>Logevall, p. 247</ref>

In January 1966, Cooper accompanied Secretary of State Rusk and Ambassador [[W. Averell Harriman]] on an official visit to [[President of the Philippines|Philippine President]] [[Ferdinand Marcos]] as part of a widely publicized "peace drive".<ref name=bluestone113 /> This visit, along with visits to South Vietnam in December 1965 and January 1966, reinforced Cooper's opposition to military operations in Southeast Asia.<ref name=johns592>Johns, p. 592</ref> In a meeting with President Johnson on January 26, 1966, he again urged the president to forego his announced intentions to resume bombing missions in North Vietnam and negotiate a settlement instead.<ref name=johns592 /> Johnson was noncommittal, and that afternoon, Cooper returned to the Senate floor, urgently trying to convince the legislators that negotiation was preferable to escalation, even when it meant negotiating with the [[Viet Cong]] fighters in South Vietnam, which he believed was necessary to achieve peace.<ref name=logevall248>Logevall, p. 248</ref> Cooper advocated a three-to-five-year cease fire, enforced by the United Nations, followed by national elections as prescribed by the [[Geneva Conference (1954)|1954 Geneva Convention]].<ref name=logevall248 /> Ultimately, Johnson did not heed Cooper's plea and resumed U.S. bombing missions in North Vietnam.<ref name=logevall249>Logevall, p. 249</ref>

In 1966, Cooper again won re-election over John Y. Brown, Sr., by 217,000 votes, breaking his own record of largest victory margin for a Kentucky senatorial candidate, and carrying the vote of 110 of [[List of counties in Kentucky|Kentucky's 120 counties]].<ref name=mourn /><ref name=finch161>Finch, p. 161</ref> In the lead-up to the 1968 Republican presidential primary, he endorsed New York Governor [[Nelson A. Rockefeller]], saying that Americans would only support a candidate who took a clear position on Vietnam.<ref name=johns608>Johns, p. 608</ref> Rockefeller had laid out a plan for reversing the Americanization of the war, while other Republican candidates tried to remain non-specific about how they would handle it.<ref name=johns607>Johns, p. 607</ref> As Rockefeller's candidacy faded, Cooper encouraged his colleague, Kentucky Senator [[Thruston B. Morton]], to seek the presidency, but Morton declined.<ref name=logevall252>Logevall, p. 252</ref> The nomination&nbsp;<U+2013> and eventually, the presidency&nbsp;<U+2013> went to Republican Richard Nixon.<ref name=logevall252 />

As a delegate to the U.N. General Assembly in 1968, Cooper strongly denounced the [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia]].<ref name=schulman95>Schulman, p. 95</ref> He also supported [[Montana]] Senator [[Mike Mansfield]]'s proposal to bring the matter of the Vietnam War before the United Nations.<ref name=bluestone113 /> Returning to the Senate in 1969, he joined Alaska Senator [[Ernest Gruening]] and Oregon Senator Wayne Morse in protesting restrictions on orderly protests at the [[United States Capitol]].<ref name=bluestone113 />

In the Senate, Cooper helped lead the opposition to the development and deployment of [[anti-ballistic missile]]s (ABMs), putting him at odds with many in his party, including President Nixon.<ref name=logevall252 /> Cooper had long been an opponent of ABMs, which he believed could intensify a worldwide nuclear arms race.<ref name=logevall252 /> On August 6, 1969, a vote to suspend funding of the development of ABMs failed in the Senate by a vote of 50<U+2013>51; Vice-President [[Spiro Agnew]] cast the tie-breaking vote.<ref name=logevall252 /> After this defeat, Cooper and Michigan Senator [[Philip Hart]] co-sponsored the [[Cooper<U+2013>Hart Amendment]] that would have allowed funding for research and development of ABMs, but banned deployment of a U.S. ABM system.<ref name=mourn /> The measure failed by three votes but increased congressional scrutiny of the [[United States Department of Defense|Defense Department]] budget, leading to a reduction in funding and hastening [[Strategic Arms Limitation Talks]] with the Soviets.<ref>Schulman, pp. 97<U+2013>98</ref> Cooper served as an advisor to President Nixon during the events leading up to the talks.<ref name=mourn />

[[File:FrankChurch.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A man with salt-and-pepper hair, wearing a white jacket and shirt and polka-dotted tie, resting his chin on his left hand|Frank Church and Cooper collaborated on a series of amendments to de-fund expanded U.S. military involvement in Southeast Asia.]]
Throughout 1969 and 1970, Cooper and Senator [[Frank Church]] co-sponsored the [[Cooper<U+2013>Church Amendment]]s, aimed at curbing further escalation of the Vietnam War.<ref name=schulman101>Schulman, p. 101</ref> Congressional approval of one of these amendments on December 15, 1969, de-funded the use of U.S. troops in [[Laos]] and [[Thailand]].<ref name=logevall254>Logevall, p. 254</ref> Cooper had wanted to include a restriction on forces entering [[Cambodia]] as well, but Mike Mansfield, who helped Cooper write the amendment, feared that Cambodian Prince [[Norodom Sihanouk]], who was officially neutral in the conflict, might be offended.<ref name=logevall254 /> When Sihanouk was [[Cambodian coup of 1970|deposed in 1970]], Cambodia's new leader, [[Lon Nol]], appealed to President Nixon for help in stabilizing his rule.<ref name=logevall254 /> Nixon agreed to send troops to Cambodia, despite protests from Cooper and others that this violated his stated goal of de-escalation in the region.<ref name=logevall254 /> Cooper and Church then drafted another amendment to de-fund U.S. operations in Cambodia; after negotiations with Nixon that continued funding until July 1970 so that the troops already in the country could be evacuated, the amendment passed 58<U+2013>37.<ref>Logevall, pp. 254<U+2013>255</ref> The House of Representatives later stripped the amendment from the legislation to which it was attached, and it did not go into effect.<ref name=logevall256>Logevall, p. 256</ref> The amendment was nevertheless hailed by ''[[The Washington Post]]'' as "the first time in our history that Congress has attempted to limit the deployment of American troops in the course of an ongoing war."<ref name=logevall256 /> The fight over the Cooper<U+2013>Church Amendments took its toll on Cooper's health, and he was briefly hospitalized to regain his strength.<ref name=logevall256 /> In 1971, Church, Mansfield, and [[George Aiken]] convinced Cooper to help them write an amendment to end U.S. involvement in Southeast Asia altogether, but ultimately, the measure did not have the support to pass and was abandoned.<ref name=logevall256 />

Seventy-one years of age and becoming increasingly deaf, Cooper announced to the Kentucky Press Association on January 21, 1972, that he would not seek re-election to his Senate seat,<ref name=schulman103>Schulman, p. 103</ref> having served longer in that body than any other Kentuckian except Alben Barkley.<ref name=finch161 /> The [[lame duck (politics)|lame duck]] Cooper decided to make one more attempt to end the war, after an aggressive North Vietnamese offensive against the South in March 1972 intensified fighting in the region once again.<ref name=logevall257>Logevall, p. 257</ref> Without advance notice, Cooper addressed a nearly empty Senate chamber on July 27, 1972, proposing an amendment to a military assistance bill that would unconditionallly end funding for all U.S. military operations in Indochina in four months.<ref name=logevall257 /> The measure, which had no co-sponsors, stunned Nixon and Secretary of State [[Henry Kissinger]] and provoked heated debate in the Senate.<ref name=logevall257 /> [[Massachusetts]] Senator [[Edward Brooke]] saved the amendment from almost certain demise by adding a provision that all American prisoners of war be returned prior to the withdrawal of U.S. forces.<ref name=logevall257 /> The revised amendment passed 62<U+2013>33, whereupon Nixon decided to sacrifice the entire military assistance bill.<ref name=logevall257 /> At Nixon's insistence, the Senate defeated the amended bill 48<U+2013>42.<ref name=logevall258>Logevall, p. 258</ref> Disappointed, Cooper nevertheless proclaimed, "I feel purged inside. I've felt strongly about this for a long time. Now it's in the hands of the President. He's the only person who can do anything about ending the war now."<ref name=logevall258 />

==Later career, death, and legacy==
After the expiration of his term, Cooper took over the "Dean Acheson chair" at the prestigious Washington D.C. law firm of [[Covington & Burling]].<ref name=schulman105>Schulman, p. 105</ref> In 1972, he was chosen as the commencement speaker at Centre College, where he had served as a trustee since 1961.<ref name=centre /> At the ceremony, he became the first recipient of the Isaac Shelby Award, named for two-time Kentucky governor [[Isaac Shelby]], who was chair of the college's first board of trustees.<ref name=centre /> In 1973, Cooper resisted an attempt to name a federal building in his honor.<ref name=mourn /> Upon the completion of the dam that formed [[Laurel River Lake]] in 1977, Congress proposed naming the dam and lake after Cooper, but again, he declined.<ref name=mourn /> He was pleased, however, that the Somerset school system chose to name a program to teach and reinforce leadership skills the John Sherman Cooper Leadership Institute.<ref name=mourn />

In April 1974, President Nixon announced that he would appoint Cooper to be the [[United States Ambassador to East Germany|U.S. Ambassador to East Germany]], but during the final negotiations between the countries for the U.S. to establish an embassy in the country, Nixon resigned the presidency.<ref>Schulman, pp. 105<U+2013>106</ref> His successor, [[Gerald Ford]], officially appointed Cooper to the ambassadorship, and he took leave from Covington & Burling to accept it.<ref name=cooper227 /> He arrived in East Germany in December 1974 and served as ambassador until October 1976.<ref name=cooper227 /><ref name=schulman107>Schulman, p. 107</ref> After returning to the U.S., he resumed his work at Covington & Burling.<ref name=mourn /> In his last act of public service, he again served as an alternate delegate to the U.N. General Assembly in 1981.<ref name=cooper227 />

[[File:John Sherman Cooper bust.jpg|thumb|right|upright|John Tuska's bust of Cooper was installed at the state capitol in 1987.]]
Kentucky Governor [[John Y. Brown, Jr.]], son of Cooper's former opponent in the senatorial elections of 1946 and 1966, awarded Cooper the Governor's Distinguished Service Medallion in 1983.<ref name=mourn /> Later that year, Senators [[Walter Huddleston|Walter "Dee" Huddleston]] of Kentucky and [[Howard Baker]] of [[Tennessee]] introduced a bill to honor Cooper by renaming the [[Big South Fork National River and Recreation Area]] to the Cooper National Recreation Area; Kentucky Congressman [[Hal Rogers]] sponsored a parallel measure in the House.<ref name=cohn>Cohn, "Bill to Name Area for Cooper Opposed"</ref> As a senator, Cooper had been instrumental in securing congressional approval for the creation of Big South Fork.<ref name=cohn /> Opponents of the measure in both Kentucky and Tennessee&nbsp;<U+2013> the recreation area spans the two states&nbsp;<U+2013> cited a variety of reasons to retain the old name and the proposal was eventually dropped at Cooper's request.<ref name=mourn /><ref name=cohn />

In 1985, Cooper became the third-ever recipient of the [[Oxford Cup]], an award recognizing outstanding past members of Beta Theta Pi.<ref name=btp /> Also in 1985, he was awarded an honorary doctorate degree from Cumberland College (now the [[University of the Cumberlands]]) in [[Williamsburg, Kentucky]].<ref name=cumberland>"Kentucky Colleges Mark Commencement". ''Lexington Herald-Leader''</ref> He was named a Distinguished Alumnus of Centre College in 1987.<ref name=centre /> A non-partisan group co-chaired by former Kentucky gubernatorial candidate [[Larry Forgy]] raised $60,000 to commission two sculptures of Cooper.<ref name=sculptures>"Group Raises $60,000 for Sculptures of Cooper".
