===Lyrics===
The lyrics of the song describe a woman who has been left by her boyfriend for another girl that is unbelievably superior in almost all aspects. She tells him not to bother making up for hurting her, because she will not be crying for him; instead, she will move on with her own life. She emphasizes this when she says, "''Don't bother, be unkind.''" The song was recorded and mixed by Gustavo Celis.

==Release==
The song was officially released on [[AOL]] Music ''First Listen Session'' on October 9 and was made available to radio stations on October 11, 2005. [[iTunes]] and other digital music stores had the single available for download October 18.

==Chart performance==
"Don't Bother" debuted at number 74 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] chart. The next week, it fell out of the chart for a week and re-entered the chart at 81 the following week. The song reached its peak position three weeks later at 42, which is moderate, but it did not lead ''[[Oral Fixation Vol. 2]]'' in the right path for success like "[[Whenever, Wherever]]" did for ''[[Laundry Service]]''. Many critics thought "Don't Bother" was going to be her first number 1 hit in the United States (a feat later accomplished by "[[Hips Don't Lie]]"), but it did not meet expectations because there were many stations that continued to play Shakira's previous hit single "[[La Tortura]]" instead of promoting "Don't Bother".

In Europe, "Don't Bother" had moderate success, especially in countries like Austria, Germany, and Italy, where the song entered the top 10 and stayed there for a few weeks. In the United Kingdom, the song debuted at number 9 but fell off the chart quickly. In Finland it debuted at number 4, but the next week fell completely off the chart. The most successful peak of the song was in the [[Romanian Top 100]], where it reached number 2. In the Romanian year-end charts, it ended up at #44<ref>http://www.rt100.ro/romanian-top-100-2007.html#/romanian-top-100-2007.html</ref>

==Music video==
[[Image:Shakira Dont bother.jpg|left|thumbnail|180px|Shakira in the "Don't Bother" video playing her pink guitar.]]
The [[music video]] for the song, directed by the visual artist [[Jaume de Laiguana]], premiered on [[MTV]]'s ''[[Making the Video]]'' on October 27, 2005. The music video for the song shows Shakira's boyfriend returning to her home early in the morning (which insinuates that he was with another woman), and lying down to sleep. While he sleeps, Shakira picks up his car keys and drives it to a scrap heap. When she gets there she starts destroying his car, doing "[[Haitian Vodou|voodoo]]" on him using his car. Everything she does to his car is reflected on his body. Another vignette shows her lying on his body.

The car ruined in the video was a 1967 [[Shelby GT 500#1967|Ford Mustang "Shelby GT 500"]] replica built to look like the "Eleanor" car from the movie ''[[Gone in 60 Seconds (1974 film)|Gone in 60 Seconds]]''. The pink guitar played by Shakira was custom made by [[Hamer Guitars]]. It is a Hamer Special Korina Jr. model with a Seymour Duncan SP-90 soapbar pickup.

This video can be seen on ''[[Oral Fixation Volumes 1 & 2]]'' bonus DVD.
