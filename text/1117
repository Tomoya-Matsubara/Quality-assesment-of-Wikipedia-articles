She returned to Malayalam through Thantra and then went on to do famous Malayalam films such as ''Keerthi Chakra'' (2006) and the award-winning ''Paradesi''. Her performance as ''Sarojini'' - a middle-class woman who fights against extreme odds - in the film, ''[[Madhya Venal]]'' earned her a special mention by Jury Chairman [[Bahman Ghobadi]] - famous [[Iran]]ian director at the [[International Film Festival of Kerala]]. Some of her Bollywood movies include, ''[[Asoka (2001 film)|Asoka]]'' (2001), ''[[Maqbool]]'' (2003) and ''[[Corporate (2006 film)|Corporate]]'' (2006).

In 2010, she won the Kerala State Government's Best Actress for her outstanding portrayal of ''Cheeru'', a village woman in the film ''[[Paleri Manikyam|Paleri Manikyam : Oru Pathira Kolapathakathinte Katha]]'' directed by [[Ranjith (director)|Ranjith]]. She also won [[Mathrubhumi]]-[[Amrita TV]] Special Jury Award and [[Asianet Film Awards#Best Supporting Actress|Asianet Film Award for Best Supporting Actress]] for the same film. 

In 2011, Shweta starred in [[Rathinirvedam (2011 film)|the remake]] of ''[[Rathinirvedam]]'', originally a Jayabharati starrer Malayalam film, produced by Suresh Kumar and directed by T K Rajiv Kumar.

Shweta recently approached a local court and the Women's Commission in Kerala after the distributor of her movie, ''Kayam'' tied up with Musli Power, a sex stimulant drug, to jointly promote the movie. "Met with Womens' Commission regarding the ''Kayam'' ad and they offered me full backing. Thank you all and I hope justice will be done," she tweeted recently. While media profusely supported her with wide coverage, many saw it as a bold attempt by a female actor against what she perceived as gross injustice to her.

===Television===
Besides working in films, she has anchored several TV, stage and film awards shows. Her stunning looks, style and panache made her one of Kerala's popular TV anchors through the  musical programme - Star Wars on [[Kairali TV]] in 2008.

In Hindi, she was a host of a Group Dance based show named ''[[Razzmatazz (TV series)|Razzmatazz]]'' on [[Zee TV]] along with actor [[Arshad Warsi]]. The next television show which she did was ''[[Dancing Queen (TV series)|Dancing Queen]]'' in 2008 on Colors and later in 2010, she anchored the Malayalam reality show, ''Honeymoon Travels'' on Surya TV. The show became an instant hit for Shwetha's accented Malayalam and her attempts to read from the original script without a formal learning in the language. Recently, she appeared as a contestant with her father in game show, Deal or No Deal on Surya TV.

==Personal life==
On 18 June 2011, she married Sreevalsan Menon, a native of [[Thrissur]] who works in [[Mumbai]]. The ceremony took place at the Neythalappurath Sastha Ayappa temple, [[Valanchery]], Kerala.<ref>{{cite news|title=Swetha Menon enters wedlock|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/regional/news-interviews/Swetha-Menon-enters-wedlock/articleshow/8902594.cms|accessdate=18 June 2011|newspaper=[[Times of India]]|date=18 June 2011}}</ref>
