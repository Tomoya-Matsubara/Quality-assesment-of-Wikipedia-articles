Jack visits the memorial service for the person he read about and finds himself to be the only attendee.  Jack contacts Kate and tells her about the memorial service.  Kate says that she did not know about it, but she would not have attended even if she did.  Jack also confesses to using the "golden pass" that they were given by [[Oceanic Airlines]] to fly across the [[Pacific Ocean]] and back every Friday, hoping that he will crash on the island.
