The '''P<U+0101>la Empire''' was one of the major [[Middle Kingdoms of India|middle kingdoms of India]] existed from 750<U+2013>1174 CE. It was ruled by a [[Buddhist]] dynasty from [[Bengal]] in the eastern region of the [[Indian subcontinent]], all the rulers bearing names ending with the suffix ''Pala'' ([[Bengali language|Modern]] {{lang-bn|<U+09AA><U+09BE><U+09B2>}} ''p<U+0101>l''), which means ''protector''. The Palas were often described by opponents as the ''Lords of [[Gau<U+1E0D>a region|Gauda]]''. The Palas were followers of the [[Mahayana]] and [[Tantric Buddhism|Tantric]] schools of Buddhism. [[Gopala (Pala king)|Gopala]] was the first ruler from the dynasty. He came to [[power (sociology)|power]] in 750 in [[Gaur, West Bengal|Gaur]] by a [[democratic]] [[election]]{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}. This event is recognized as one of the first [[democratic]] elections in [[South Asia]] since the time of the [[Mahajanapadas|Mah<U+0101> Janapadas]]. He reigned from 750<U+2013>770 and consolidated his position by extending his control over all of Bengal. The Buddhist [[dynasty]] lasted for four centuries (750<U+2013>1120 CE) and ushered in a period of stability and prosperity in [[Bengal]]. They created many temples and works of art as well as supported the Universities of [[Nalanda]] and [[Vikramashila]]. [[Somapura Mahavihara]] built by [[Dharmapala of Bengal|Dharmapala]] is the greatest Buddhist [[Vihara]] in the [[Indian Subcontinent]].

The empire reached its peak under [[Dharmapala of Bengal|Dharmapala]] and [[Devapala]]. Dharmapala extended the empire into the northern parts of the [[Indian Subcontinent]]. This triggered once again the power struggle for the control of the subcontinent. [[Devapala]], successor of Dharmapala, expanded the empire to cover much of [[South Asia]] and beyond. His empire stretched from [[Assam]] and [[Utkala]] in the east, [[Kamboja Kingdom|Kamboja]] (modern day [[Afghanistan]]) in the north-west and [[Deccan]] in the south. According to a Pala copperplate inscription Devapala exterminated the Utkalas, conquered the Pragjyotisha (Assam), shattered the pride of the [[Huna people|Huna]], and humbled the lords of [[Pratihara]]s, [[Gurjara]] and the [[Dravida]]s.

The death of Devapala ended the period of ascendancy of the Pala Empire and several independent dynasties and kingdoms emerged during this time. However, [[Mahipala]] I rejuvenated the reign of the Palas. He recovered control over all of Bengal and expanded the empire. He survived the invasions of [[Rajendra Chola]] and the [[Chalukyas]]. After Mahipala I the Pala dynasty again saw its decline until [[Ramapala]], the last great ruler of the dynasty, managed to retrieve the position of the dynasty to some extent. He crushed the [[Varendra]] rebellion and extended his empire farther to [[Kamarupa]], [[Orissa]] and [[Northern India]].

The Pala Empire can be considered as the golden era of Bengal. Never had the Bengali people reached such height of power and glory to that extent. Palas were responsible for the introduction of [[Mahayana Buddhism]] in [[Tibet]], [[Bhutan]] and [[Myanmar]]. The Palas had extensive trade as well as influence in [[south-east Asia]]. This can be seen in the sculptures and architectural style of the [[Sailendra|Sailendra Empire]] (present-day [[Malay Peninsula|Malaya]], [[Java]], [[Sumatra]]). The Pala Empire eventually disintegrated in the 12th century weakened by attacks of the [[Sena dynasty]] followed by the invasion of [[Ikhtiyar Uddin Muhammad bin Bakhtiyar Khilji|Bakhtiyar Khilji]]'s Muslim armies.<ref name = Scott>{{cite journal

==Origin of the Palas==
[[File:IndianBuddha11.JPG|thumb|left|200px|[[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] and [[Bodhisattva]]s, 11th century, Pala Empire.]]

The [[Ramacharitam]] of Sandhyakar Nandi attests that [[Varendra]] (or [[Pundravardhana|North Bengal]]) was the fatherland (''Janakabhu'') of the Palas. In the Bangarh [[Indian copper plate inscriptions|Copperplate]] inscription of [[Mahipala]] I, it has been stated that Mahipala recovered his ancestral homeland (''Rajyam Pitram'') from the usurpers (which was until that time occupied by the [[Kamboja-Pala Dynasty|Kamboja-Pala Kingdom]]).

===Caste===
The caste origin of the Palas is not clearly stated in any of the numerous Pala records. The Khalimpur copper plate inscription of [[Dharmapala (emperor)|Dharmapala]], the second Pala emperor, states that [[Gopala (Pala king)|Gopala I]] was a son of a warrior (''Khanditarat'') named Vapyata, grandson of a highly educated man (''Saryavidyavadat'') named Dayitavishnu, and [[Gopala#Democratic election of Gopala|he himself was elected to the throne of Bengal]].

The Kamauli copper plate inscription of king Vaidyadeva of [[Kamarupa]] ([[Assam]]) connects the Palas to the [[Kshatriyas]] of "''Mihirasya vamsa''" ([[Surya]] lineage).<ref>Epigraphia Indica, XXIV, p 43, Dr N. G. Majumdar</ref><ref>The History and Culture of the P<U+0101>las of Bengal and Bihar, cir. 750 A.D.-Cir 1200AD, 1993, p 37, Jhunu Bagchi</ref><ref>The Dacca University Studies, 1935, p 131, University of Dacca</ref><ref>Ancient Kamboja, People and the Country, 1981, p 316, Dr J.

The ''Ballala-Carita'' says that "The Palas were low-born [[Kshatriya]]s", a claim reiterated by the historian [[Taranatha]] in his "History of Buddhism in India" as well as Ghanaram Chakrabarty in his ''[[Dharmamangalkavya|Dharmamangala]]'' (both written in the 16th century CE). The Ramacharitam also attests the fifteenth Pala emperor, [[Ramapala]], as a [[Kshatriya]].<!-- <ref>http://www.reference.com/browse/wiki/Pala_Empire</ref> --> <!-- broken link --> As Gopala I was a Buddhist, he was also branded as a [[<U+015A>udra]] king in some sources.<ref>Op cit., p 37, Jhunu Bagchi; Indian Antiquary, Vol IV, 1875, pp 365<U+2013>66; Corpus of Bengal Inscriptions, Mukerjee and Maity, p 11</ref><ref>Caste and Chronology of the Pala kings of Bengal, J.

Arabic accounts tell us that Palas were not kings of noble origin{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} <sup>[not of aryan origin?]</sup>. According to [[Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak]] (in [[Ain-i-Akbari]]), the Palas were [[Kayastha]]s. There are even accounts that claim Gopala may have been from a [[Brahmin]] lineage.<ref>Al-Hind, the Making of the Indo-Islamic World, 1990, p 265, Andr<U+00E9> Wink; History of Medieval India, 1940, p 20, fn, Ishwari Prasad <U+2013> India.</ref>

==''Matsyanyaya'' and the ascendancy of the Palas==
After [[Shashanka]]'s reign, Bengal was shrouded in obscurity and was shattered by repeated invasions. During the reign of [[Manava (king)|Manava]], Bengal was invaded and divided between [[Harshavardhana]] and [[Bhaskaravarman]]. In 730 CE Jayavardhana of the Shaila Dynasty from [[Central India]] invaded Bengal and killed the king of [[Pundra Kingdom]]. [[Yasovarman]] (725<U+2013>752) of [[Kannauj]] killed the king of [[Magadha]] and [[Gauda]]. Later [[Lalitaditya Muktapida]] (724<U+2013>760) of [[Kashmir]] who defeated Yasovarmana invaded Bengal. Sri Harsha of Kamarupa conquered [[Anga]], [[Vanga Kingdom|Vanga]], [[Kalinga_(India)|Kalinga]] and Odra. The social and political structure of Bengal was devastated. According to T<U+0101>ran<U+0101>tha: Every single [[Brahman]], every [[Kshatriya]], every Elite became all powerful in their areas and surrounding regions. This condition has been described by him as ''Matsyanyaya'' (Eating of small fish by the big fish) or the Dark Age of Bengal. Disgusted at the situation the desperate people of Bengal made a bold move which marked a glorious period in the history of the sub-continent. They elected [[Gopala (Pala king)|Gopala]], a popular military leader, as their king by a [[democratic]] [[election]] which was probably the only democratic election in medieval India.

==Religion==
[[File:Nalanda.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Nalanda University]] is considered one of the first great [[university]] in recorded history, reached its height under the Palas.]]
After the [[Buddhist]] king [[Harsha|Harsha Vardhana]], [[Buddhism]] faced the possibility of extinction{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}. The Palas emerged as the champion of Buddhism, and they patronized [[Mahayana Buddhism]]. The Palas supported the Universities of [[Vikramshila|Vikramashila]] and [[Nalanda]] which became the premier seats of learning in [[Asia]]. The [[Nalanda University]] which is considered one of the first great [[universities]] in recorded history, reached its height under the patronage of the Palas.<ref>http://www.discussanything.com/forums/archive/index.php/t-62248.html</ref>

The Palas were responsible for the spread of Mahayana Buddhism to [[Tibet]], [[Nepal]], [[Bhutan]], [[Myanmar]] and the [[Malaysia|Malay]] archipelago. Bengal became famous in the Buddhist world for the cultivation of Buddhist religion, culture and other knowledge in the various centres that grew under the patronage of the Pala rulers.<ref>http://www.lotussculpture.com/pala.htm</ref> Buddhist scholars from the Pala empire travelled from Bengal to the [[Far-East]] and propagated Buddhism. A few outstanding individuals among them are Shantarakshit, Padmanava, Dansree, Bimalamitra, Jinamitra, Muktimitra, Sugatasree, Dansheel, Sambhogabajra, Virachan, Manjughosh and many others. But the most prominent was [[Atish Dipankar Srigyan]] who reformed Buddhism in Tibet after it had been destroyed by king [[Langdharma]]. Although the Palas were Buddhists, they had also given support to [[Saiva]] ascetics, typically the ones associated with the Golagi-Math.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bagchi|first=Jhunu|title=The History and Culture of The P<U+0101>las of Bengal And Bihar (Cir. 750 A.

==Peace and Expansion==
[[Gopala (Pala king)|Gopala]] united all of [[Bengal]] and brought peace and prosperity in the region. The period of anarchy ended with his election. The Pala kings devoted themselves in public welfare and social reform. The Palas adopted the policy of religious toleration and co-existence of the [[Buddhists]] and the [[Hindus]]. Pala kings won the heart of the people by welfare activities like digging tanks and establishing towns took place in many folklores in the rural areas of Bengal. The ''Mahipala Geet'' (Songs of [[Mahipala]]) is still popular in the rural areas.

Palas adopted aggressive policy and began the period of expansion under [[Dharmapala of Bengal|Dharmapala]] and [[Devapala]]. At its height Dharmapala's empire covered most of northern and central region of the [[Indian Subcontinent]]. His successor [[Devapala]] extended the boundaries of the empire further to [[Assam]] in the east, [[Kamboja Kingdom|Kamboja]] in the north-wast and the [[Deccan]] in the south. Devapala united much of [[South Asia]] under his rule, a feat only achieved before by [[Ashoka the Great]]. The successors of Devapala had to contend with the [[Pratihara|Gurjara-Pratihara]] and the [[Rashtrakutas]] for the supremacy of the [[Kannauj|Kannauj Triangle]]. After [[Narayan Pala|Narayanpala]] the Pala empire declined but was revived once more under the vigorous reigns of [[Mahipala]] and [[Ramapala]].

==Pala administration==
Pala rule was Monarchial. King or Monarch was the centre of all power. Pala kings would adopt Imperial titles like ''Parameshwara'', ''Paramvattaraka'', ''Maharajadhiraja''. Pala kings appointed Prime Ministers. The '''Line of Garga''' served as the Prime Ministers of the Palas for 100 years.

Pala Empire was divided into separate ''Bhukti''s (Provinces), Bhuktis into ''Vishaya''s (Divisions) and ''Mandala''s (Districts). Smaller units were ''Khandala'', ''Bhaga'', ''Avritti'', ''Chaturaka'', and Pattaka. Administration covered widespread area from the grass root level to the imperial court. The Pala copperplates mention following administrative Posts:''Raja'', ''Rajanyaka'', ''Rajanaka'', ''Ranaka'', ''Samanta'' and ''Mahasamanta'' (Vassal kings), ''Mahasandhi-vigrahika'' (Foreign minister), ''Duta'' (Head Ambassador), ''Rajasthaniya'' (Deputy), ''Aggaraksa'' (Chief guard), ''Sasthadhikrta'' (Tax collector), ''Chauroddharanika'' (Police tax), ''Shaulkaka'' (Trade tax), ''Dashaparadhika'' (Collector of penalties), and ''Tarika'' (Toll collector for river crossings), ''Mahaksapatalika'' (Accountant), ''Jyesthakayastha'' (Dealing documents), the ''Ksetrapa'' (Head of land use division) and ''Pramatr'' (Head of land measurements), the ''Mahadandanayaka'' or ''Dharmadhikara'' (Chief justice), the ''Mahapratihara'', ''Dandika'', ''Dandapashika'', and ''Dandashakti'' (Police forces), ''Khola'' (Secret service). Agricultural posts like ''Gavadhakshya'' (Head of dairy farms), ''Chhagadhyakshya'' (Head of goat farms), ''Meshadyakshya'' (Head of sheep farms), ''Mahishadyakshya'' (Head of Buffalo farms) and many other like ''Vogpati'', ''Vishayapati'', ''Shashtadhikruta'', ''Dauhshashadhanika'', ''Nakadhyakshya''.

==Pala Literature==
[[File:Astasahasrika Prajnaparamita Dharmacakra Discourse.jpeg|thumb|right|The Pala Empire had an enormous influence on the development of the [[Vajrayana]] school of Buddhism, today practiced in Tibet, Mongolia, Russia and China.  This image of the Buddha from an Ashtasahasrika Prajnaparamita manuscipt dates to the late Pala period, from the [[Nalanda University]].  Upon the destruction of Nalanda University and the Pala Empire, Pala monks fled to Buddhist friendly Tibet, and today that country traces much of it's Buddhist lineage to this exodus, acting as a time capsule that preserves thousands of Indian sutras in Tibetan.]]
{{See also|Atisha|Charyapada|Ramacharitam}}
The proto-Bangla language was born during the reign of the Palas. The Buddhist texts of the [[Charyapada]] were the earliest form of Bangla language. This Proto-Bangla language was used as the official language in Tibet, Myanmar, Java and Sumatra. Texts on every aspect of knowledge were compiled during the Pala Rule. On philosophy: ''Agama Shastra'' by Gaudapada, ''Nyaya Kundali'' by Sridhar Bhatta, ''Karmanushthan Paddhati'' by Bhatta Bhavadeva; On Medicine: ''Chikitsa Samgraha'', ''Ayurvedidvipika'', ''Bhanumati'', ''Shabdachandrika'', ''Dravya Gunasangraha'' by Chakrapani Datta; ''Shabda-Pradipa'', ''Vrikkhayurveda'', ''Lohpaddhati'' by Sureshwara; ''Chikitsa Sarsamgraha'' by Vangasena; ''[[Sushrata]]'' by Gadadhara Vaidya; ''Dayabhaga'', ''Vyavohara Matrika'' and ''Kalaviveka'' by [[Jimutavahana]] etc. [[Atisha]] compiled more than 200 texts. The great epic [[Ramacharitam]] written by Sandhyakar Nandi, the court poet of Madanapala was another masterpiece of the Pala literature. The Pala copperplate inscriptions were of excellent literary value. This distinctive inscriptions were called ''Gaudiya Style''.

==Pala art and architecture==
[[File:Paharpur 03.JPG|thumb|[[Somapura Mahavihara]] is the greatest Buddhist [[Vihara]] in the [[Indian Subcontinent]] built by [[Dharmapala of Bengal]]; it became a [[World Heritage Site]] in 1985.]]
The most brilliant side of the Pala Empire was the excellence of its art and sculptures. Palas created a distinctive form of Buddhist art known as the "Pala School of Sculptural Art." The gigantic structures of Vikramshila Vihara, Odantapuri Vihara, and Jagaddala Vihara were masterpieces of the Palas. These mammoth structures were mistaken by the forces of [[Ikhtiar Uddin Muhammad Bin Bakhtiyar Khilji|Bakhtiar Khilji]] as fortified castles and were demolished. The Somapura Mahaviharaa, a creation of Dharmapala, at [[Paharpur]], Bangladesh, is the largest Buddhist Vihara in the Indian subcontinent, and has been described as a "pleasure to the eyes of the world." [[UNESCO]] made it [[World Heritage Site]] in 1985. [[Sompur Bihara]], also built by Dharmapala, is a monastery with 21 [[acre]] (85,000 m<U+00B2>) complex has 177 cells, numerous stupas, temples and a number of other ancillary buildings. In 1985, the [[UN]] included the Sompur Bihara site in the world Cultural Heritage list. The Pala architectural style was followed throughout [[south-eastern Asia]], [[China]], [[Japan]] and [[Tibet]]. Bengal rightfully earned the name "Mistress of the East". Dr. Stella Kramrisch says: "The art of Bihar and Bengal exercised a lasting influence on that of [[Nepal]], [[Burma]], [[Ceylon]] and [[Java]]". [[Dhiman]] and [[Vittpala]] were two celebrated Pala sculptors. About Sompura Mahavihara, Mr. J.C. French says with grief: "For the research of the [[Pyramids]] of [[Egypt]] we spend millions of dollars every year. But had we spent only one percent of that money for the excavation of Sompura Mahavihara, who knows what extraordinary discoveries could have been made."---"The Art of the Pala Empire of Bengal," p.&nbsp;4.

==Pala foreign relations==
Palas came in contact with distant lands through their conquests and trades. The [[Sailendra]] Empire of [[Java]], [[Sumatra]] and [[Malay Peninsula|Malaya]] was a colony of the Palas. [[Devapala]] granted five villages at the request of the Sailendra king Balputradeva of Java for the upkeeping of the [[matha]] established at Nalanda for the scholars of that country. The Prime minister of the Balputradeva Kumar Ghosha was from [[Gaur, West Bengal|Gauda]]. Dharmapala who extended his empire to the boundary of the [[Abbasid Empire]] and had diplomatic relations with the caliph [[Harun Al-Rashid]].<ref name="experiencefestival.com">http://www.experiencefestival.com/pala_empire_-_external_references</ref> Coins of Harun-al-Rashid have been found in [[Mahasthangarh]]. Palas maintained diplomatic and religious relation with [[Tibet]]. During the military expeditions of the Pala kings the Pala generals would establish kingdoms of their own in [[Punjab region|Punjab]] and [[Afghanistan]]. Recent discoveries in the Punjab hills showed the influence of the Pala Dynasty. There is a strong and continuous tradition that the ruling families in certain states are descended from the "Rajas of Gaur in Bengal". These states are [[Suket]], [[Keonthal]], Kashtwar and [[Mandi, Himachal Pradesh, India|Mandi]]. In the ancient [[Rajput]] states tradition has immense force and accuracy. Of Kashtwar it is related that '''Kahan Pal''' <U+2014> the founder of the state <U+2014> with a small band of followers arrived in the hills in order to conquer a kingdom for himself. He is said to have come from [[Gaur, West Bengal|Gaur]], the ancient capital of Bengal and to have been a cadet of the ruling family of the place. The demise of the [[Shahi|Turkshahi]] rule in [[Gandhar]] and the rise of the [[Hindushahi]] dynasty in that region might have connection to the invasion of the Palas in that region.

==Pala armed forces==
[[File:Indian Kanauj triangle map.svg|thumb|right|250px|The [[Pala dynasty|Palas]] of [[Bengal]] in comparison with other contemporary empires such as the [[Rashtrakuta]]s of [[Deccan]] and the [[Pratihara]]s of [[Malwa]] in the focal point of "'''[[Kanauj]] Triangle'''."]]
Palas had fourfold army consisting of: [[infantry]], [[cavalry]], [[War elephant|elephants]] and [[chariot]]s. In the copperplates of [[Vatsaraja]] [[Dharmapala of Bengal|Dharmapala]] had been mentioned as the owner of unlimited number of horses, elephants and chariots. It is amazing that when the use of chariots had been backdated in India and other parts of the world the kings of Bengal still depended on four-horsed heavy chariots. Being a riverine land and swarthy climate Bengal was not good enough for breeding quality [[War Horse|war-horses]]. So the Palas had to depend upon their vassal kings for war horses. Pala copperplate inscriptions reveal that mercenary forces were recruited from the [[Kamboja Kingdom|Kamboja]], [[Khasa]], [[Huna people|Huna]], [[Malwa]], [[Gujarat]], and [[Karnataka|Karnata]]. The [[Kamboja Horsemen|Kamboja cavalry]] were the cream of the Pala army who would later become as powerful as the [[Janissary]] army of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The Kamboja forces maintained smaller confederates (Sanghas) among themselves and were staunch follower of their commander. Palas had the army divided into following posts: Senapati or Mahasenapati (General) controlling foot soldiers, cavalry, soldiers riding elephants and camels, and the navy, and the various army posts like Kottapala (Fort guards) and Prantapala (Border guards). Palas had a huge army and the legend of "Nava Lakkha Shainya" (Nine lac soldiers) were popular during the reigns of Dharmapala and Devapala. According to [[Hudud al-Alam]] a [[Persian language|Persian]] text written in 982<U+2013>983 Dharmapala possessed an army of 300,000 soldiers. According to Sulaiman the Arab traveller Devapala set out for his every military expedition with an army of 50,000 elephants and his army had 10,000<U+2013>15,000 slaves for the maintenance and caretaking of his armies.

==Legacy==
Palas legacy gets remembered not much in Bengal but elsewhere in [[Asia]]. [[Tibet]]'s modern culture and religion is heavily influenced by Palas.<ref>{{cite book | last = Chattopadhyaya | first = Alaka | title = Atisa and Tibet | publisher = Motilal Banarsidas Publishers Pvt.

[[Atisa]], a Palan, is a celebrated figure in the Tibetan Buddhism in tradition and in establishment. Atisa also invented [[bodhichitta]] or known as "mind training" that is practiced around the world today. Another important Palan figure in Tibetan Buddhism is [[Tilopa]] who founded the [[Kagyu]] lineage of [[Tibetan Buddhism]] and developed the [[Mahamudra]] method, a set of spiritual practices that greatly accelerated the process of attaining [[bodhi]] (enlightenment). Palas literature is widely studied by Buddhist around the world. Pala architectural style was copied throughout south-eastern Asia, China, Japan, and Tibet. [[Nalanda|Nalanda University]] and [[Vikramshila|Vikramshila University]] are two of the greatest Buddhist universities ever recorded in history.

<!-- {{Kambojas}}

[[File:IndianBuddha11.JPG|thumb|250px|[[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] and [[Bodhisattva]]s, 10th/11th century: '''Kamboja.vamsha.tilaka''' Rajyapala of the Irda Copper plate was a ''Parama-saugata'' (devoted [[Buddhist]]), but other kings of the Kamboja-Pala dynasty were [[Historical Vedic religion|Vedic]] [[Hindus]]]]
The '''Kamboja-Pala Dynasty''' ruled parts of [[Bengal]] in the 10th to 11th centuries CE, gradually gaining independence from their former liege lords, the Palas.

==Origins==
{{Main|Kamboja migrations}}

During the last centuries BCE, many clans of the [[Kambojas]] entered India in alliance the with [[Saka]]s, [[Pahlava]]s, [[Yavana]]s and spread into [[Sindhu]], [[Saurashtra (region)|Saurashtra]], [[Malwa]], [[Rajasthan]], [[Punjab region|Punjab]] and Surasena.<ref name="Ancient Kamboja 1981, pp 296-309">Ancient Kamboja, people and the Country, 1981, pp 296<U+2013>309, 310, Dr J. L. Kamboj; The Kambojas Through the Ages, 2005, pp 158<U+2013>162, 168<U+2013>69, S Kirpal Singh</ref><ref>cf: "Along with Sakas, numerous tribes of Kambojas had crossed Hindukush and spread into whole of north India especially into Punjab and [[Uttar Pradesh]] etc. [[Mahabharata]] (12.102.5) specifically attests that Kambojas and Yavanas conquered [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]] country. The Kambojas also find mention in the Mathura Lion Capitol Inscriptions issued by Saka Mahakshatrapa Rajuvala" (India And The world 1964 p 154 by Dr Buddha Parkash). </ref> The Kamboh Darwaza in the city of Meerut is named after the Kambojas. An offshoot of these Kambojas moved eastwards and entered [[Bengal]], [[Bihar]] and [[Orissa]] and in 10th century, they founded a large empire in north-west Bengal.<ref>Ancient Kamboja, People and the Country, 1981, p 311, Dr J. L. Kamboj</ref>

==Ancient sources on Kamboja Rule in Bengal==
There are several ancient inscriptions which attest [[Kamboja]] rule in Bengal and [[Bihar]]. The most important sources are:

===Dinajpore Pillar Inscription===
The ''Dinajpur Pillar Inscription'' makes mention of a certain Kamboja king called the ''Kambojanvaya Gaudapati'' (i.e lord of [[Gauda]], born in Kamboja family). The Pillar Inscription was originally established in a [[Shiva|Siva]] [[Temple]] which was built by Kambojanvaya Gaudapati in Gauda country. But during [[Muslim]] rule, the Pillar was brought to Bangar about 40 miles east of Gauda. During 18th century AD, the Pillar was further moved to Dinajpore by Maharaja Ram Nath and as a result, the inscription came to be known as Dinajpore Pillar Inscription.<ref>
:Durvararivaruthini.paramthaney danai cha vidhyadhraih (1)
:Sanandamdiviyasaya maragangunahgram graho gyatai (2)
:'''Kambojanvaya''' Gaudapatina natenendu moleryam (3)
:Parsado nirmaya kunjarghattavarsheynh bhubhushanh."(4)
:(Wording of Dinajpore Pillar Inscriptions)

:TRANSLATION:
"In the battle field, the '''Kamboja Raja''' was a warrior like Durga (Chandi) and in making charity gifts he was like vidhyadharas. His honor and glory was sung and praised in the whole of India as well as in the Swargaloka (heaven). The Kamboja had wiped out all his enemies from the face of earth. This Pillars inscription was raised Kamboja to commemorate his glorious victory over the ruler of Gauda country. The Kamboja raja raised magnificent temple in honor of lord Siva. In so doing, the Kamboja made himself so popular and dear to his subjects like the ornaments are dear to the women."

L Kamboj. These Kamboj People, 1979, p 182, K. S. Dardi; Kamboj Itihaas, 1972, pp 89<U+2013>90, H. S. Thind)</ref>

According Dr R. C. Majumdar, ''Kunjarghatavarsheyan'' was a personal name of Kambojanvaya Gaudapati, but that may also imply his epithet. The imperial title Gaudapati (Gaudeshawara) as testified by the Dinajpore Pillar Inscription is obviously his imperial title. Term Kambojanvaya implies that he belonged to the [[Kamboja]] [[Lineage (anthropology)|lineage]]. The inscription further reveals that Kambojanvaya Gaudapati was a [[devotee]] of lord [[Shiva|Siva]]. The date of this record has been shown to be 888 [[Saka]], though this is stated to be doubtful (Dr R. C. Majimdar). Scholars state that the Dinajpore Pillar Inscription belongs to the second half of 10th c AD.<ref> History and Culture of Indian People, The Age of Imperial Kanauj, p 54, 1964, Dr. R. C. Majumdar and Dr A. D. Pusalkar</ref>

===Irda Copper Plate (Tamrapatra)===
Irda Copper plate (''Irda Tamarapatra'') is another very important source on the Kamboja-Pala dynasty of Bengal. The Copper Plate was discovered in 1931 from a landlord named Mrityunjaya Narayan Prahraj of Irda, District Balasor in [[Orissa]]. The Inscription was edited by Dr N. G. Majumdar and published with his comments in 1934 in the Epigraphia Indica.<ref>Epigraphia Indica, XXII, 1933<U+2013>34, pp 150<U+2013>158, Dr N. G. Majumdar</ref> Irda Copper plate is written in [[Sanskrit]] tongue and has 49 lines of text written in ancient Bengali [[writing system|script]]. The Vamsa or the [[tribe|tribal]] identity of the rulers mentioned in the Irda Copper Plate is specifically stated to be ''Kamboja-Vamsha-Tilaka'' (i.e Ornament of the Kamboja family or Glory of the Kamboja tribe).<ref> '''Kambojavamshatilaka''' Paramasaugata Maharajadhiraja parameshvara paramabhattAraka Rajyapala</ref> Like the Dinajpore Pillar Inscriptions, the Irda [[Indian copper plate inscriptions|Copper plate]] is also thought to belong to the second half of 10th c AD (Dr N. G. Majumdar, Dr R. C. Majumdar). Hence the scholar community believes that the '''Kambojanvaya Gaudapati''' of Dinajpore Pillar Inscriptions and the '''Kambojavamshatilaka Paramasaugata Maharajadhiraja parameshvara paramabhattaraka Rajyapala''' of Kamboja-Pala dynasty of Irda Copper Plate Inscriptions refers to the same [[Kamboja]] family. But whereas the Dinajpur Pillar inscriptions refer just to one Kamboja ruler eith appellation as as "Kambojanvaya Gaudapati", the Irda Copper plate, on the other hand, mentions generation after generation of the Kamboja-Pala kings of Bengal i.e Rajyapala, Narayanapala and Nayapala etc. The Kamboja-Pala kings of Irda Copper plate had ruled north-west Bengal in 10/11th c.<ref> Ancient Kamboja, People and the Country, 1981, p 315, Dr J. L Kamboj; Ancient India, 1956, p 382-83, Dr R. K. Mukerjee, The Kambojas Through the Ages, 2005, p 208-210, S Kirpal Singh</ref>

===Bangar Grant of Mahipala I===
Bangar Charter<ref>Inscription No 5</ref> of [[Mahipala|Mahipala I]] is the third very important ancient source of Kamboja rule in Bengal. The charter asserts that Mahipala had re-conquered nearly the whole of north and east Bengal ''"after defeating the usurpers who had seized his ancestral kingdom"''.<ref>

==Extent of Kamboja Empire==
No definite information is available on the precise geographical area of the Kamboja-Pala kingdom of Bengal. According to Irda Copper plate evidence, the Kamboja-Pala kingdom definitely comprised ''Varadhmana-Bhukti Mandala'' (modern Burdman division) and ''Dandabhukti Mandala'' within the Kamboja empire. The Dandabhukti division is believed to have comprised southern and south-western parts of district [[Midnapore]] as well as the lower parts of river Suvaranrekha in district [[Balasore]]. Evidence from Dinajpore Pillar Inscription attests that the Gauda country also formed parts of Kamboja-Pala kingdom. But as long as we do not include northern Ladha (Radha or W. Bengal) in Kamboja-Pala empire, the region does not constitute one viable political entity. Hence it appears likely that northern parts of Radha may also formed parts of Kamboja-Pala kingdom. Dr R. C. Majumdar says that Gauda and Radha both formed parts of Kamboja-Pala empire <ref>History of Ancient Bengal, 1971, p 127, Dr Ramesh Chandra Majumdar <U+2013> Bengal (India).</ref> During second half of the 10th century, [[Chandella]] king Yashovarman invaded the Palas and the Kambojas and he claims to have conquered Gauda and [[Mithila]].<ref>History and Culture of Indian People, Age of Imperial Kanauj, p 85, Dr A. D. Pusalkar, Dr R. C. Majumdar</ref> It is also stated that Chandela chief Dhanga of Jejabhukti, the successor of Yashovarman, had invaded Radha towards the end of 10th century AD. As a consequence, the Kamboja power in the north Bengal received a severe jolt.<ref> Ancient Kamboja, People and the Country, 1981, p 315, Dr J. L. Kamboj</ref> This political scenario enabled the Pala king Mahipala I to re-conquer Gauda from the Kambojas.<ref>Ancient India, 2003, p 651, Dr V. D. Mahajan</ref> The last king of the [[Kambojas]] was ''Dharamapala'' who continued to rule Dandabhukti in the first quarter of 11th century AD.<ref> Ancient Kamboja, Peoole and the Country, 1981, p 315-16, Dr J. L. Kamboj; Decline of the Kingdom of Magadha, p 413, B. P. Sinha; Some Historical Aspects of the Inscriptions of Bengal, p 379-80, B. C. Sen etc</ref> The Capital of the Kamboja Pala kingdom is stated to be ''Pryangu'' which has not been identified yet,<ref>Journal of Asiatic Society of Bengal, VII, 619; History and Culture of Indian People, The Age of Imperial Kanauj, p 54, 1964, Dr. R. C. Majumdar and Dr A. D. Pusalkar</ref> though some scholars tend to identify the same with an old village known as Pingvani located in Garvet Thana.<ref>Epigraphia Indiaca, Vol XXIV, p 46,Dr J. C. Ghosh; quoted by Dr J. L. Kamboj in Ancient Kamboja, People and the Country. 1981, p 334.</ref>

==Known Kamboja Kings of Bengal==
We know the names of three [[Kamboja]] rulers of the Kamboja Pala family for sure viz. ''Rajyapala, Narayanapala and Nayapala''. The Charter (Copper Plate Inscription) was issued by Kamboja king Nayapala wherein he and his father are given the imperial titles like ''Parameshevara, Paramabhattacharya and Maharajadhiraja''. The Copper Plate Inscription also attests that the founder of the Kamboja Pala dynasty was king ''Rajyapala''. He has been referred to as '' '''Kambojavamshatilaka''' Paramasaugata Maharajadhiraja parameshvara paramabhattAraka-Rajyapala''. This proves that this line of kings belonged to the [[Kamboja]] [[Lineage (anthropology)|lineage]]. The second king is Narayanapala who was son of Rajayapala. Narayanapala was succeeded by his younger brother Nayapala, the author of the Irda Copper plate. Dr R. C. Majumdar states that the expression ''Kunjarghatavarshan'' of the Dinajpore Pillar Inscription indicates that Kunjarghatavarshan was personal name of ''Kambojanvaya Gaudapati'' of the Dinajpore Pillar Inscription. If this is so, then this Kambojanvaya Gaudapati is the fourth known Kamboja king of Kamboja dynasty of Bengal. Some scholars however believe that the Kambojanvaya Gaudapati of the Dinajpore Pillar Inscriptions is same as Kambojavamshatilaka Rajyapala of the Irda Copper plate. This does not seem to be true since Rajyapala of the Irda Copper plate is described as [[devotee]] of [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] (''Parama-saugata'') where as Kambojanvaya Gaudapati of Dinajpore Pillar Inscriptions claims in his own inscription to be a [[Shiva|Siva]] [[devotee]]. It may however be possible that Kambojanvaya Gaudapati is same as Kamboja king Nayapala of the Irda Copper plate since king Nayapala also claims to be a Saivite (Siva devotee) in the Irda Copper plate. The last known ruler of the Kamboja Pala dynasty is stated to be king ''Dharamapala'' who ruled in Dandabhukti in first quarter of 11th century AD.<ref> Some Historical Aspects of the Inscriptions of Bengal: Pre-Muhammadan Epochs, 1942, p 380, 383, Dr Benoychandra Sen <U+2013> Bengal (India); Journal of the Varendra Research Museum, Vol.1<U+2013>4 1972-1975/1976, p 109, Varendra Research Museum <U+2013> Bangladesh; Ancient Kamboja, People and the Country, 1981, pp 318, 316 etc; History and Culture of Indian People, The Age of Imperial Kanauj, p 54, 1964, Dr. R. C. Majumdar and Dr A. D. Pusalkar; Decline of the Kingdom of Magadha, p 413, B. P. Sinha; Some Historical Aspects of the Inscriptions of Bengal, p 379-80, B. C. Sen</ref>

==Pala Dynasty vs Kamboja-Pala Dynasty==
Curiously, there are several similarities between the Kamboja Pala ruling family and the so-called Pala ruling family of Bengal: e.g.
* ''The names '''Rajyapala, Narayanapala and Nayapala''' born by the Kamboja-Pala kings (mentioned in Irda Copper plates) are also born by Pala emperors of the (so-called) Pala dynasty of Bengal <ref>Ancient Indian History and Civilization, 1999, p 280, Sailendra Nath Sen.</ref>'',
* ''The Kamboja-Pala king Rajyapala of Irda Copper plate and king Rajyapala (II) of the so-called Pala dynasty belong exactly to the same era and time frame'',
* ''Kamboja-Pala king Rajyapala of the Irda Copper plate and king Rajyapala (II) of the so-called Pala dynasty assumed exactly similar imperial titles i.e. '''Parmeshevara, Paramabhattacharya and Maharajadhiraja''' '',
* ''Kamboja-Pala king Rajyapala of the Irda Copper plate and Rajyapala (II) of the so-called Pala dynasty have assumed exactly similar religious epithets i.e '''Paramasaugata''' (devotee of the Buddha)'',
* ''The queen of Kamboja-Pala king Rajyapala of Irda Copper plate is named '''Bhagyadevi''', which very interestingly is also the name born by the queen of the so-called Pala king Rajyapala (II)'',
* ''The Kamboja-Pala kings of Irda Copper plate as well as the Pala kings of the so-called Pala dynasty use 'Pala' as the last part of their names'',
* ''The Kamboja-Pala kings of Irda Copper plate as well as the Pala kings of the so-called Pala dynasty are known to have similar religious beliefs'',
* ''The [[writing system|script]] and [[language]] of Irda Copper plate and that of the Dinajpur Pillar inscriptions belonging to the Kamboja-Pala dynasty is very identical to that of the numerous charters and grants of the kings of the so-called Pala dynasty of Bengal''.

Based on these startling similarities, some scholars have gone to the extent of stating that the Pala dynasty and the Kamboja-Pala Dynasty of Irda Copper plate & Dinajpore Pillar Inscription is one and the same dynasty. But if this is really so, then the inescapable conclusion which must follow is that the ''unified Kamboja/Pala dynasty of Bengal must belong to the [[Kamboja]] [[Lineage (anthropology)|lineage]]''.<ref>Ancient Kamboja, People and the Country, 1981, pp 317<U+2013>18, Dr J. L. Kamboj</ref><ref>The Kambojas Through the Ages, 2005, p 213, S Kirpal Singh. This conclusion is so simple since the [[ethnicity]] of the rulers of Irda Copper plate as well as the one in the Dinajpore Pillar Inscripptions is unequivocally stated as "Kamboja" while that of the so-called Pala dynasty has nowhere been identified in any of its own numerous inscriptions.</ref>

It is very curious to note that whereas the identity of the Kamboja Pala rulers of Bengal has been referred to ''twice'' and is indisputably connected to the Kamboja [[ethnicity]], that of the Palas has nowhere been specifically stated in any of the Pala traditions in numerous of their Grants, Charters and Inscriptions (Dr D. C. Sircar). According to ''Manju<U+015B>ree M<U+016B>lakalpa'', Gopala I was a [[Shudra|<U+015A>udra]].<ref>The History and Culture of the P<U+0101>las of Bengal and Bihar, Cir. 750 A.D.-cir ..., 1939, p 37, Jhunu Bagchi <U+2013> History.</ref><ref>See also: Indian Antiquary, Vol IV, 1875, pp 365<U+2013>66; Corpus of Bengal Inscriptions, Mukerjee and Maity, p 11; Caste and Chronology of the Pala kings of Bengal, J.

K. Maitreya.</ref> ''Ramachrita'' of ''Sandhyakaranandi'' attests Pala king Ramapala as a Kshatriya,<ref> Ramachrita I.17.</ref> but in another portion of the same text, Dharmapala is described as Smudrakula-dipa,<ref> Ibid, Jhunnu Bagchi.</ref> though, the reason why the origin of the Palas has been ascribed to the Sea (Samudrakula) remains obsecure.<ref>Some Historical Aspects of the Inscriptions of Bengal: Pre-Muhammadan Epochs, 1942, p 307, Dr Benoychandra Sen <U+2013> Bengal (India).</ref> In the ''Udaya-sundari-katha'', a ''Champu-Kavya'', written by ''Soddhala'' in the eleventh century, Pala king [[Dharmapala]] is said to have belonged to the family of [[Mandhata]] of the [[Ikshvaku]] line which is known to belong to solar race.<ref>A Socio-political and Economic Study, Northern India, 1990, p 63.</ref><ref>Prabha Chandra Sen has tried to reconcile the two theories of the "Solar origin" and "Samudrakula (Ocean) origin" by saying that Samudra was son of the illustrious Pauranic king Sagara of Kosala (A Socio-political and Economic Study, Northern India, 1990, p 63, Jai Narayan Asopa). But son of Sagara was Asamanja and not Samudra (See: Genealogy of Ikshvaku in Ancient Indian Historical Tradition, 1922, p 147, Dr P. E. Pargiter). Moreover, why did the Pala lineage not start from king Sagara, father of Samudra, who was very illustrious in the line of the Ikshvakus, rather than the little known Samudra? Obviously, the hypothesis is unconvincing and has no value at all.</ref> It is also stated that they were born of a Ksatriya mother.<ref>Indian Culture, 1934, p 113, Indian Research Institute.</ref> ''"All these hear-says practically have no value at all for discussion"''.<ref> Op cit, Jhunnu Bagchi, p 37.</ref>

The ''Kamauli Copper Plate'' inscription of king ''Vaidyadeva'' of Kamarupa ([[Assam]]) <ref>See: Gaudalekhamala, pp 127<U+2013>146, A. K. Maitreya.</ref> indisputably connects the Palas to the [[Kshatriyas]] of ''"Mihirasya vamsa"'' (''Surya lineage'').<ref>See some refs: Epigraphia Indica, XXIV, p 43, Dr N. G. Majumdar; The History and Culture of the P<U+0101>las of Bengal and Bihar, Cir. 750 A.D.-cir ..., 1003, p 37, Jhunu Bagchi <U+2013> History; The Dacca University Studies, 1935, p 131, University of Dacca; Ancient Kamboja, People and the Country, 1981, p 316, Dr J.

Since Mihira means Sun or Sun worshipper, the expression Mihirasya implies ''connected with or relating to the Sun or Sun Worship'' ([[Sanskrit]] Mitra, [[Persian language|Persian]] Mithira == > Mihira = Sun). According to ''Bhavishya Purana'', the Mihira lineage originated from the union of Nishkubha, daughter of [[Rsi]] Rijihva and the Sun (Mihira).<ref>Dr D. R. Bhandarkar, Dr Buddha Parkash.</ref> From this wedlock was born a sage called ''Zarashata'', who apparently is [[Zoroaster]] of the [[Iran]]ian traditions. ''Mihirasya Vamsa'' means ''Mihira Vamsa'' which is also found written as ''Mihirkula'' i.e lineage of the Sun-worshippers. The reference to ''Mihirasya vamsa'' as being the [[Lineage (anthropology)|lineage]] of the Palas of Bengal as attested independently by the Kamauli Grant of king Vaidyadeva of Assam holds a probable clue that the Palas may have come from the Sun-Worshipping lineage i.e [[Iran]]ian or [[Zoroastrian]] line of the Kambojas.<ref>Bryant cites Hesychius (6th century CE): "MiqraV o hlioV para PersaiV" ("Mithras, the sun of Persia") and "MiqrhV o protoV en PersaiV QeoV" ("Mithres, the first god in Persia."). Hesychius thus confirms not only the solar nature but also the /Persian/ origin of Mithra, still known in his day.</ref><ref> The priests of Mithra, and of Iranian Sun and Fire worship in general, were the Magi or Magas. The Magas entered India on a number of occasions over a period of centuries, prior to and during the common era. At this point, Indian Sun worship became increasingly formalized, with elaborate rituals, temples and images sprouting up and from the 6th century CE onward, royal names began to have "Mihira" (Mithra) in them after a millennium of integration (or reintegration) into Indian culture. </ref>

The fact that [[Gopala (Pala king)|Gopala I]], the founder of the so-called Pala dynasty was a Buddhist and that he has also been branded as a <U+015A>udra king <ref>Op cit., p 37, Jhunu Bagchi; Indian Antiquary, Vol IV, 1875, pp 365<U+2013>66; Corpus of Bengal Inscriptions, Mukerjee and Maity, p 11; Caste and Chronology of the Pala kings of Bengal, J. C.

The ancient Indian traditions also incidentally attest the scholarship and learning of the Kambojas who excelled in education and produced many outstanding teachers and sages in ancient and medieval times. Scholars further note that ''Vapyata'', the grand father of Gopala I, had come into east from the north-west Punjab,<ref>Ref: The Place of Assam in the History and Civilization of India, 1970, p 20, Dr S. K. Chatterjee, Published by Dept. of Publication, University of Gauhati.</ref> which if true, definitely means Gandhara/Kamboja region.

It is notable that one section of scholars like Dr N. G. Majumdar,<ref> See: The Modern Review, 1937, pp 323<U+2013>24, N. G. Majumdar; See also: Quotation Dr H. C. Ray, Indian Historical Quarterly, XV-4, December 1939, p 110, fn 11; Also quoted by Dr J. L. Kamboja in his Ancient Kamboja, People and the Country, 1981, p 323; Quoted in: 'The Modern Review, 1907, p 440, by Ramananda Chatterjee <U+2013> India; See also: Indian Historical Quarterly, 1963, p 509.</ref> Chandra Chakrabarty,<ref>See: The Racial History of India, 1944, p 834, Chandra Chakraberty <U+2013> Ethnology.</ref> E.

Vasey Westmacott.</ref> etc consider that the so-called '''Pala Rulers of Bengal (''authors of Pala Empire'') actually belonged to Kamboja race'''. Dr N. G. Majumdar was the original editor of ''Irda Copper plate'', and had initially thought that the '''Pala Dynasty''' and the '''Kambboja Pala dynasty''' were two separate dynasties, but later on, had modified his views in light of new discovery which demonstrated that king Rajyapala-II of the so-called Pala dynasty, just like king Rajyapala of the Irda Copper plate, was found as adorned with religious epithet of ''Parama-saugata'' (devoted [[Buddhist]]) as well as the imperial title of the ''Maharajadhiraja''.<ref>Ancient Kamboja, People and the Country, 1981, p 316-17; Dr J. L. Kamboj; See also the Quotation of Dr H. C. Ray, Indian Historical Quarterly, XV-4, December 1939, p 110, fn 11, quoted by Dr J. L. Kamboja in his Ancient Kamboja, People and the Country, 1981, p 323.</ref> Based on this new evidence and earlier similarities, ''Dr N. G. Majumdar, had accordingly changed his views and got inclined to identify the Pala Dynasty of Bengal with the Kambojas, and thereby, also dispelling the earlier views on the origin of the Pala kings of Bengal''.<ref>Quoted in: 'The Modern Review, 1907, p 440, by Ramananda Chatterjee <U+2013> India.</ref>

Dr H. C. Ray however, has advised a policy of 'wait' till the discovery of more powerful evidence before we can say that the '''Pala dynasty''' and the '''Kamboja Pala Dynasty''' belonged to the Kamboja race. He oberserved: ''"I can only suggest that we must wait for more definite proof before we can say that the Palas were Kambojas"''.<ref>See: The Indian Historical Quarterly, 1963, p 511; Indian Historical Quarterly, XV-4, December 1939, p 110, fn 11, Dr H.

L. Kamboj cautions that if we identify Rajyapala of the [[Pala Dynasty]] with the [[Rajyapala kamboja|Rajyapala]] of the 'Irda Copper Plate', then we will have no option other than to accept that the Pala Dynasty of Bengal had sprang from the Kamboja race.<ref>Pr<U+0101>c<U+012B>na Kamboja, jana aura janapada =: Ancient Kamboja, people and country, 1981, p 356, Dr Jiy<U+0101>l<U+0101>la K<U+0101>mboja, Dr Satyavarti Sastri <U+2013> Kamboja (Pakistan); See also: The Modern Review, 1907, p 324, Dr Ramananda Chatterjee.</ref> Dr R. C. Majumdar advises that if we identify the ''Kamboja-vamsa-tilaka Rajyapala'' of the Irda Copper plate with the Rajyapala of the Pala dynasty, then we must also accept that after Rajyapla, the Pala empire had split up into two.<ref>The History of Bengal, Vol I, p 127 Dr R. C. Majumdar</ref> Dr R. C. Majumdar further advises that ''"although the presumption about the identity (of the Palas with the Kambojas) is certainly a reasonable one, the evidence in favor of it can not be regarded as conclusive.."''.<ref> History of Ancient Bengal, 1971, p 172, Dr R. C. Majumdar <U+2013> Bengal (India); cf: Dacca University Studies, Vol I, No 2, p 131; ff.</ref>

''In spite of the above, the probabilities of unification of two dynasties and their connection to [[Kamboja]] [[Lineage (anthropology)|lineage]] seem to have tremendously increased though''.

==New Possible Interpretation of Dinajpore Inscription==
The Rajyapala of Irda Copper plate has been referred to as ''Kambojavamshatilaka'' (i.e belonging to the Kamboja lineane). If he and Rajyapala II of the Pala dynasty is one historical personage, then one shall have accept that the Palas dynasty originated from the [[Kambojas]]. The only other source referring to the Kamboja rulers in [[Bengal]] is the ''Dinajpore Pillar Inscription'' which refers to a ruler ''Kambojanvaya Gaudapati'' and its date has been fixed to later half of 10th century. Up till recently, the scholars believed that the Kambojas could not have won [[Gauda]] without defeating the Palas of Bengal hence it was assumed that Kambojanvaya Gaudapati came as some foreign invader from the northern hills and wrested north and western Bengal from the Paslas. If it is proved that the Palas and the Kambojas are one people, the Dinajpore Pillar shall have to be interpreted differently <ref>
The Early History of Bengal: From the Earliest Times to the Muslim Conquest, 1939, p 81, Pramode Lal Paul <U+2013> Bengal (India).</ref> i.e . if the Palas and Kambojas are unified, then Kambojanvaya Gaudapati of the Dinajpore Pillar inscription shall have to be accepted as a representative of the Palas, and there shall be no need to assert that the Kambojas came as foreign invaders from the northern hills and wrested the Gauda from the Palas. The only basis of the so-called usurpation of Bengal by the Kambojas is the vague statement of king [[Mahipala|Mahpala I]], the author of Bangar Grant<ref>Inscription No 5</ref> which asserts that Mahipala had re-conquered nearly the whole of north and east Bengal ''"after defeating the usurpers who had seized his ancestral kingdom"''<ref>Anudhikrit vilupatan Rayamasadhya pitram<U+2026><U+2026>..verse 11, Inscription No 5</ref> but ''"Who were the usurpers the inscription does not tell but other evidences indicate that the rulers belonging to the Kamboja family were in possession of the north and west Bengal''.<ref> History and Culture of Indian People, The Age of Imperial Kanauj, p 55, Dr A. D. Pusalkar, Dr R. C. Majumdar; The struggle for Empire, p 24, Dr A. D. Pusalkar, Dr R. C. Majumdar</ref> Scholars have only speculated that Mahipala's Charter alludes to 'seizing of the northern parts of Bengal from the Gopala II or Vigrahapala II by the Kambojas', which the great king claims to have won back by the force of his arms.<ref>See: Ancient India, 2003, p 651, Dr V. D. Mahajan; History of Bengal, I, 133; Dr R. C. Majumdar, The Dynastic History of Northern India, II, 676, Dr H. C. Ray; Some Historical Aspects of the Inscriptions of Bengal, p 399, Dr B. C. Sen; Ancient Kamboja, People and the Country, 1981, p 318-19, Dr J. L. Kamboj</ref> If the two dynasties are united, then this may mean that Rajyapala II had three sons: Gopala II, Narayanpala and Nayapala.<ref>The Early History of Bengal: From the Earliest Times to the Muslim Conquest, 1938, p 82, Pramode Lal Paul.</ref> Gopala II inherited [[Magadha]] and northern Bengal while Narayanapala got rest of the empire including western Bengal. Narayanapala was thus rival and competitor of Gopala. Narayanapala was succeeded by his younger brother Nayapala. These two sons of Rajayapala, in all probability, were the usurpers of the ancestral land of Mahipala I, the grand son of Gopala II. This may be the reason as to why these two kings do not find any mention in the ''main genealogy of the Palas'' which was continued by [[Mahipala|Mahipala I]] onwards. It is also interesting to note that the [[genealogy]] of rulers mentioned in the Irda Copper plate of king Nayapala does not go beyond Rajyapala.<ref>Ancient Kamboja, People and the Country, 1981, p 317-18, Dr J. L. Kamboj</ref><ref>Dr D. C. Sircar also favors unification of the two dynasties. He also suggests that Narayanapala of the Irda Copper plate was a brother of Gopala II, the inheritor to the throne after Rajyapala. He was therefore a rival and competitor of Gopala. Narayanapala had carved out a principality for himself out of the kingdom of Gopala (referenced by Dr J. L. Kamboj in his above cited book)</ref>

==Religion of Kamboja rulers of Bengal==
The ''Kambojanvaya Gaudapati'' of Dinajpore Pillar Inscriptions is stated to be a builder of [[Shiva|Siva]] [[temple]] and therefore was [[devotee]] of Siva. He is said to be a great bestower of the charities. ''Kambojavamsatilaka Rajayapala'', the first king of the Irda Copper plate is referred to as ''Parama-saugata'' (devotee of Buddha). The third ruler Narayanapala Kamboja is stated to be a devotee of god [[Vishnu]]. King Nayapala Kamboja, the author of Irda Copper plate is known to have practiced Siva cult. There is no information on the Kamboja ruler Dharamapala, but it appears likely that he may have also been a [[Historical Vedic religion|Vedic]] follower i.e. either Saivite or a Vishnu devotee. The Irda Copper plate has references to [[Hindu]] gods, high rising temple buildings as well as to the sacred smokes rising from the Yagya fires into the skies. This again alludes to the Hinduism of the Pala Kambojas. Irda Copper plate also makes special references to the Purohits, Kritivajyas, Dharmagyas and other holy officials. Thus we find that the Kamboja kings of Bengal were mostly [[Historical Vedic religion|Vedic]] [[Hindu]]s, of course, with the exception of king Rajyapala. Mention is made of grants of lands and villages to the Purohits in the Burdwan district of east Bengal. According to Prof R. C. Majumdar: "More significant, however, is the inclusion of Purohits in the land grants of the [[Kamboja]], [[Varman]] and [[Sena]] kings of [[Bengal]]. It indicates the great importance was attached to religious and social aspects of administration during rules of these dynasties which were all followers of orthodox Hinduism." (History of Bengal, Vol I., p 281, Dr R. C. Majumdar</ref> Dr B. N. Sen says that the [[Buddhism]] which had followers in the early Pala and Candra rulers was probably on the decline in Bengal during 10th c AD. On the other hand, the [[Historical Vedic religion|Vedic religion]] was on the rise. Since the Kamboja Pala kings of Bengal were mostly [[Historical Vedic religion|Vedic]] [[Hindu]]s, hence they must have got full support from their subject which must have helped them raise a powerful empire in Bengal.<ref>Some Historical Aspects of the Inscriptions of Bengal, p 378-79, B. C. Sen</ref>

==Kambojas in Caste System of Bengal==
In the ancient caste classification in Bengal, there are references to people who came as invaders from [[Ordinal directions|northwest]] or accompanied the invaders. These people have been described as Mlechchas in the brahmanical Caste System in Bengal. Ancient [[Sanskrit]] and [[Pali]] texts and inscriptions profusely attest the Kambojas as a Mlechcha [[tribe]] of [[Uttarapatha]] or Udichya division belonging to [[Indo-Iranians|Indo-Iranian]] or Scytho-Aryan and not to the Mongolian stock. The north-westerners including the [[Kambojas]], [[Saka]]s, [[Huna people|Hunas]], [[Yavana]]s, [[Abhira]]s, [[Khasas]], [[Sabaras]], [[Turushakas]], [[Suhmas]] etc have all been labelled as outsiders, foreigners or Mlechchas within the Bengali society and therefore were left outside the Caste Classification of ancient Bengal. [http://tanmoy.tripod.com/bengal/caste.html]
''Compare also'': '''Part-II: VI. Ancient peoples of Bengal''': [https://www.vedamsbooks.com/no27183.htm].<ref>The Author, Annapurna Chattopadhyaya, is probably not right here to include the Kambojas among the '''Extraneous Tribal Communities from North-east'''. Rather, they should have been included among the '''Tribal Communities from North-west''' which group comprises the Sakas, Yavanas, Hunas, Khasas, Abhiras, Turukshakas with whom the Kambojas are always found associated in numerous ancient [[Sanskrit]] texts. Doubtless, the Kambojas belong to the [[Uttarapatha]] as [[Mahabharata]], [[Ramayana]], [[Purana]]s and other ancient texts abundantly show. See [[Kamboja Location]]</ref>

==Evidence on Later Kamboja Rulers in Bengal==
There is a literary evidence which attests one Kamboja king known as Jagan Nath ruling in Bengal as late as that 16th century AD. King Jagan Nath is stated to have patronized a [[Brahmana]] scholar Sura Mishra who had composed ''Jagannathaprakasa'', a Smriti Granth in honor of this Kamboja king:

:Ashesh.'''Kambojakula'''.vatansah Shri Jagana Natha iti parsidhah
:Akaryad dharmanibandhmaytam dhradhipaiapayairkablai nreshe<ref> (Notices of Sanskrit MSS., Vol V, No 1790;, R. L. Mitra, Ancient Kamboja, People and the Country, p 208, Dr J. L. Kamboj ) </ref>
This shows that the Kamboja rule in some parts of Bengal must have continued, as late as 16th century AD.

==Opinions of Some Scholars==
'''Dr V. A. Smith''':
* "During the later part of tenth century, the rule of Palas was interrupted by the intrusion of hillmen known as Kambojas, who set up one of their chief as the king. His rule is commemorated by an inscribed pillar at Dinajpore created apparently in AD 966"<ref>Early History of India, 1967, Dr V. A. Smith</ref>

'''Dr [[Benjamin Walker]]''':
* "A branch of [[Kambojas]] seem to have migrated eastwards along the [[Himalaya]]n foothills, hence their notices in the [[Tibet]]an and [[Nepal]]i chronicles. Later, they entered the [[Gangetic plain]]s and by nine century AD came into conflict with the Palas of [[Bengal]]. In the 10th c, the Pala rule in Bengal was terminated by Kambojas who had set up one of their chiefs as king. The Kamboja rule in Bengal lasted until they were deposed by resurgent Palas in 980 AD. The descendants of Kambojas are still found in Northern Bengal<ref>Hindu World Vol I, p 520 by [[Benjamin Walker]]).</ref>

'''Dr P. C. Baghci''':
* ''"The Kambojas, a nomadic tribe, lived beyond Himalayas in [[Central Asia]]. One of their branches entered India in very early times and after a while lost its identity as distinct people by merging into the local population, but other batches of them must have entered east [[Tibet]] and the valley of [[Mekong]] from another direction. By this assumption only, we can explain why the name Kambuja was given to the kingdom founded in the middle valley of the Mekong. In eastern Tibet their name can be traced in the name of the province of Khams and it was probably from this region that the Kamboja invasion of Assam took place in later times. A branch of them migrated to North Bengal at an early period though their actual invasion came at a later date"''<ref> Journal, 1943, p 110, Greater India Society <U+2013> India; India & Central Asia, p 117, Dr P.

'''Dr B. C. Law''':
* "In 9th c AD, the Kambojas are said to have been defeated by Devapala, the great king of the Pala dynasty of Bengal.<ref>Dr. R. D. Bannerjee, Vengalar Itihaasa, p 182</ref> But during latter part of 10th c, the tables were turned and the rule of Palas kings was interrupted by the Kambojas, who had set up one of their chiefs as a king. In a certain place called Vanagarh in Dinajpore, mention is made of a certain king of Gauda, born in [[Kamboja]] family. It is probable that during the reign of Devapaladeva, the Kambojas first attempted to conquer [[Gauda]], but were, at that time defeated.<ref>Dr. R. D. Bannerjee, Vengalar Itihaasa, p 184</ref> Dr. R. R. Chanda supposes that in the middle of 10th c AD, the Kambojas of Himalayas again attacked North-Bengal and took away north-east Bengal from them. The present inhabitants of North Bengal viz [[Koch]], Mech and Palia were descended from them.<ref> Refs about Dr. R. P. Chanda appears in: Vangar Itihaasa, p 205, Dr R. D. Banerjee</ref> The Kamboja rule in Bengal was terminated by Mahapala I, the 9th king of Pala line, who is known to have been reigning in AD 1026 and may be assumed to have regained his ancestral throne from Kambojas at about 980 AD" .<ref>Some Kshatrya Tribes of Ancient India, 1924, p 251, Dr B. C. Law)</ref>

'''B. G. Karlsson''':
* Cf: "The Rajbansis (which means of 'royal race') intellectuals have traced their lineage to the purer ancient Kamboj dynasty in the northwestern India. It was the wrath of Parsurama that forced them away from their original homeland and led them to settle in north Bengal (Basu 1994, p 59-61)".<ref>Contested Belonging: an Indigenous People's struggle in Sub-Himalayan Bengal, 2000, p 202, B. G. Karlsson.</ref>

'''Hasna Jasimuddin Mouddud''':
* Cf: After Devapala's death, the decline of the Pala dynasty in North India was rapid. Northern Bengal was first invaded and annexed by the king of [[Pratihara]], Mahendrapala, sometime before 898 AD and later northern and western Bengal were annexed by the [[Kambojas]], a powerful hill [[tribe]] from the north or the east India"<ref>South Asia: Eastern Himalya Culture, Ecology and People: Ancient Heritage and Future Prospects, Hasna Jasimuddin Mouddud</ref>

'''R. R. Diwarkar''':
* "In course of his military campaign, Pala king [[Devapala]] is said to have reached Kamboja. The Kambojas of ancient India are known to have been living in north-west, but in this period, they are known to have been living in the north-east India also, and very probably, it was meant [[Tibet]]. Thus Devapala might have come into conflict with [[Tibet]], there is nothing surprising in this because [[Tibet]]an sources claim that their kings Khri-Srong-Ide-Btson and his son Mu-Tag-Btsan-Po subdued India and forced Dharamapala to submit. Devapala may have also clashed with them and defeated them"<ref>Bihar Through the Ages, G. Ed. R. R. Diwarkar, 1958, p 312).</ref>

'''Alternative View''' (in line with view of R. R. Diwarkar)
* A branch of the [[Pamir]]ian Kambojas seems to have migrated eastwards towards Tibet hence their notice in the chronicles of [[Tibet]] ('''Kam-po-tsa, Kam-po-ce, Kam-po-ji''') and [[Nepal]] (Kambojadesa).<ref> "The view that Nepali Traditions apply name Kamboja Desha to Tibet is based on the statement made by Foucher, [Iconographie bouddhique pp 134<U+2013>135] on the authority of Nepali Pandit of B.H Hdgson. But it is supported by two manuscripts [No 7768 & 7777] described in the Catalogue of Sanskrit and Prakrit Mss in the library of India Office Vol II, Part II". [Dr R. C. majumdar, History of Bebgal, I, 191, Dist Gazeteer [Rajashahi], 1915, p 26; Some Historical Aspects of the Inscriptions of Bengal, Dr B. C. Sen, p 342, fn 1] </ref> [[Burma|Burmese]] chronicles refer to it as '''Kampuchih'''. The Pamirian Kambojas may have receded to Tibet in wake of the [[Kushana]] (1st century) or [[Huna people|Huna]] (5th century) pressure. Later the same Kamboja branch appears to have moved towards [[Assam]] from where they may have invaded Bengal during the bad days of the Palas and wrested north [[Bengal]]. Fifth century AD [[Brahma Purana]] mentions Kambojas around Pragjyotisha and Tamraliptika.<ref>Brahama Purana 53/16; See also: The Indian Historical Quarterly, Vol.VI, No.1, 1930.03 pp. 98<U+2013>99 fn-2, Dr P.C.

These Kambojas had made first bid to conquer Bengal during the reign of king Devapala (810 AD-850 AD) but were repulsed. A latter attempt was crowned with success when they were able to deprive the Palas of the suzerainty over North and West Bengal and set up a Kamboja dynasty in Bengal towards the middle of 10th century AD.

'''A Short History of Bengal'''
* "On the other hand, they may be the [[Kambojas]] from north west India from where the Pala used to get their horses, the [[Tibet]]ans, or the Koca [[tribe]] (''the related tribe Mleca may be the origin of the term Mleccha''). There is also a south [[India]]n reference to a [[Kamboja]] king gifting a stone to [[Rajendra Chola|Rajendra Cola]] for the Nataraja temple. Other references to Kambojas abound in the ancient literature, and this may have been just the expansion of an [[Indo-European people|Indo-European]] tribe with both [[Persian peoples|Persian]] and [[Indic]] affinity from their homeland in the [[Afghanistan]]-[[Turkistan]] (''Some relate their name to [[Cambyses]] of the [[Achaemenian]] empire of early 6th cent BC'') region along the foothills of the [[Himalaya]]s towards Bengal, along the coast to [[Gujarat]], to [[Ceylon]], and maybe to [[Cambodia]].

'''Dr Debala Mitra''':
* "A section of the Kambojas, originally living on the north-western frontier of India, most probably in Afghanistan, and belonging to the Parasaka vanna, according to the Buddhaghosa, came and permanently settled in different parts of India. They lent their name to some of the localities occupied by them. A few of the families went to the extent of carving out principalities like the one temporarily eclipsing the fortunes of the Palas of eastern India (Bengal) in the tenth century A.D. <U+2026>..".<ref>Cultural Heritage of India, by Dr Debala Mitra, p 625</ref>

'''Dr A. D. Pusalkar''':
* "It is held by some scholars that the Kambojas were a hill tribe from tribe from [[Tibet]] or other regions who had conquered Bengal.

But no territory was gained in this campaign<U+2014>even the neighboring kingdoms of [[Kamarupa]] ([[Assam]]) and Utkala ([[Orissa]]) were only compelled to render tribute. The two successors of Devapala were more religious-minded and in that period the [[Pratihara|Pratihars]] annexed both [[Magadha]] and ''Varendri'' (Bengal) while Kamarupa and Utkala also resumed independence.

* Dr Jogindra Ghosh also says that the [[Kamboja]] rulers of Bengal had come from the [[Cambay|Kambey]] in [[Gujarat]], but curiously he connects the Kamboja rulers of Bengal with the Pratiharas of [[Gujarat]].<ref> Epigraphia Indica, XXVI., p 45-46.</ref>

'''Dr J. L. Kamboj''':
* According to Dr J. L. Kamboj, during second/first centuries BCE, many clans of the Kambojas entered India in alliance the with [[Sakas]], [[Pahlavas]], [[Yavana]]s and spread into [[Sindhu]], Saurashtra, [[Malwa]], [[Rajasthan]], Punjab and Surasena.<ref name="Ancient Kamboja 1981, pp 296-309"/> The [[Kamboh]] Darwaza in the city of [[Meerut]] is named after the Kambojas. An offshoot of these Kambojas moved eastwards and entered Bengal, Bihar and Orissa and in 10th century, they founded a large empire in north-west Bengal.<ref>Ancient Kamboja, People and the Country, 1981, p 311, Dr J. L. Kamboj.</ref>

'''Dr B. R. Chattetjee''':
* Interestingly, Dr B. R. Chattetjee supposes that the Kambojas who founded the Kamboja empire in Bengal may have come from the [[Kambuja]] of [[Indo China]].<ref>Indian Cultural Influence in Cambodia, pp 278<U+2013>79, Dr B. R. Chatterjee</ref>
