'''GU Energy Labs''' is a company based in [[Berkeley, California]], in the United States, that produces performance sports nutrition products, most notably [[energy gel]]s. Usually consumed during endurance events, the gels are designed to be quickly and easily [[digestion|digested]]. Other products include energy chews, brews, brew tablets, and a Roctane Ultra Endurance line that includes an energy drink formula mix and gel.

==Background==
Sports [[energy gel]]s emerged in the United Kingdom in 1986 as a "convenient, prewrapped, portable" way to deliver [[Carbohydrate metabolism|carbohydrates]] during endurance events.<ref name=Schwarb>{{Cite news|last=Schwarb|first=John|url=http://www.sptimes.com/2003/01/03/Sports/Forget_carb_filled_ba.shtml|title=Forget carb-filled bars, runners gaga for goo"|work=[[Tampa Bay Times|St. Petersburg Times]]|date=January 3, 2003|accessdate=January 13, 2014|location=St. Petersburg, Florida}}</ref> Gels have a gooey texture and are sometimes referred to as "goo" generically.<ref name=Dialogues>{{cite journal|last=Gallman|first=Judith M.|title=Brian Vaughan: GU Guru|journal=Oakland Magazine|url=http://www.oaklandmagazine.com/Oakland-Magazine/January-February-2009/Dialogues/|accessdate=February 11, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2004-11-19/news/0411190030_1_energy-gels-power-gel-electrolytes|title=A new fuel for athletes: energy gels|date=November 19, 2004|accessdate=January 23, 2014|work=[[The Baltimore Sun]]|first=Judith|last=Blake|issn=1930-8965|publisher=[[Tribune Company]]}}</ref> The gel Leppin Squeezy was distributed at the Hawaii [[Ironman Triathlon]] in 1988. Once considered a "cult product in clear packaging", energy gel products are now marketed in fancy packaging and come in a variety of flavors.<ref name=Schwarb/> The energy gel market grew during the 1990s, as professional athletes began endorsing products. Manufacturers generally encourage the consumption of multiple packets, with water, when participating in endurance events. Individual packets typically cost between 99 cents and $1.29 (as reported by the ''[[Tampa Bay Times|St. Petersburg Times]]'' in 2003).<ref name=Schwarb/>
