'''James Wood-Mason''' (1846 &ndash; 1893) was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[zoologist]]. He was the director of the [[Indian Museum]] at [[Calcutta]], after [[John Anderson (zoologist)|John Anderson]]. He collected marine animals and [[lepidoptera]], but is best known for his work on two other groups of insects, [[phasmids]] and [[mantids]].

The genus ''[[Woodmasonia]]'' Brunner, 1907, and at least ten species of phasmids, are named after him.<ref name=Bragg>Bragg, 2008.</ref>

==Life and career==

Wood-Mason was born in Gloucestershire, England, where his father was a doctor. He was educated at [[Charterhouse School]] and [[Queen's College, Oxford]]. He went out to India in 1869 to work in the Indian Museum, [[Calcutta]], which in 2008 still housed his collection of insects.<ref name=Bragg/>

In 1872 he sailed to the [[Andaman Islands]], mostly studying marine animals, but also collecting and later describing two new [[phasmids]], ''[[Bacillus hispidulus]]'' and  ''[[Bacillus hispidulus]]''.<ref>Despite the generic name, these are insects, not bacteria.</ref><ref name=Bragg/>

Wood-Mason described 24 new species of phasmids, mostly from South Asia but also some from Australia, New Britain, Madagascar, the Malay peninsula and Fiji. His naming of ''[[Cotylosoma dipneusticum]]'' (Wood-Mason, 1878) is particularly curious as he never formally described the species; it was wrongly imagined to be semi-aquatic; it was "described with what is probably the least precise measurement ever used for a phasmid", namely ""between three and four inches in length<U+201D>; and he gave its locality as Borneo, when in fact it came from Fiji.<ref name=Bragg/>

In 1887 he became Superintendent of the Indian Museum. Also in 1887, he became vice-president of the Asiatic Society of Bengal.<ref name=Bragg/>

In 1888 he sailed on the Indian Marine Survey steamship ''[[HMS Investigator (1881)|HMS Investigator]]'', working on and later describing new species of [[Crustacea]].<ref name=Bragg/><ref>{{cite book | title=A Naturalist in Indian Seas, or, Four years with the Royal Indian marine survey ship 'Investigator' | publisher=John Murray | author=Alcock, Arthur | year=1902 | location=London}}</ref>

==Honours==

Wood-Mason was a Fellow of the [[Royal Entomological Society]]. In 1888 he became a Fellow of the [[University of Calcutta]].<ref name=Bragg/> Over 10 marine animals have the specific name ''woodmasoni'' in his honour, including several described by Arthur Alcock of the ''Investigator'': ''[[Heterocarpus woodmasoni]]'', ''[[Coryphaenoides woodmasoni]]'', ''[[Thalamita woodmasoni]]'', ''[[Rectopalicus woodmasoni]]''.<ref name=Bragg/>
