'''Pullman Square''' is a [[Lifestyle center (retail)|lifestyle center]] in [[downtown]] [[Huntington, West Virginia]] between 8th and 10th Street and 3rd Avenue and Veteran's Memorial Boulevard. It is located on what was known as the '''[[Cityscape of Huntington, West Virginia#Urban renewal|Superblock]]''', <ref name="HD_022299">{{cite news | last=Ross | first=Jim |title=Chi-Chi's not interested in moving | publisher=''[[Herald-Dispatch]]'' | date=1999-02-22 }}</ref> a large [[urban renewal]] project that saw the demolishing of four city-square-blocks in 1970. <ref name="HD_101900">{{ cite news | last=Wellman | first=Dave |title=Officials hope decades of flops are over | publisher=''[[Herald-Dispatch]]'' | date=2000-10-19 }}</ref>

== History ==
=== Superblock ===
The Superblock was to be a large [[urban renewal]] project in downtown Huntington. <ref name="HD_022299"/> In 1970, <ref name="HD_101900"/> a four-block {{convert|9|acre|m2|adj=on}} vacant site was created for the next "large development," however, problems besieged the area for decades. In 1974, a master plan was developed for the vacant site. <ref name="HD_101900"/>

In 1977, the [[Big Sandy Superstore Arena|Huntington Civic Arena]] was constructed on one parcel. One year later, a group of [[entrepreneur]]s wanted to construct a 350-room [[hotel]] and retail stores, however, the plan died by 1980. <ref name="HD_101900"/> In 1983, the ''National Shamrock Development and Investment Company'' wanted to develop the property and took a two-year lease on the project. By mid-1985, however, the lease ran out and the developers could not receive financial backing due to the failure in their $15 million ''Urban Development Action Grant'' request.

In the spring of 1986, the ''Huntington Development Corporation'' suggested that an off-track betting facility be constructed, however, the idea died after Governor [[Arch A. Moore, Jr.|Arch Moore]] vetoed an off-track betting bill that was critical to the project's success. <ref name="HD_101900"/> In 1987, the ''Webb Companies'' presented a plan for a $110 million mixed-use complex called '''''RiverCenter''''' that would feature a 20-story office tower, an underground [[parking garage]] and a [[skywalk|skyway]] to the [[Harris Riverfront Park]]. <ref name="HD_101900"/> The project failed when two large tenants could not be found to anchor the project. In 1988, the city's grant to help develop the project was revoked.

Another instance included an [[outlet mall]] proposal that was announced on May 6, 1987, however, two-months later, the [[Herald-Dispatch]] reported that the project was "dead" and that the "13-year history of failure haunts (the) Superblock." <ref name="HD_101900"/> Another proposal, on April 28, 1989 reported on a development that was "on tap," followed by an article several years later that stated, "super development dream fails to become reality." In 1992, a two-story [[shopping center]] was proposed but the idea failed to receive tenant support. <ref name="HD_101900"/>

A [[Chi-Chi's]] Mexican restaurant was constructed on the corner of 3rd Avenue and 10th Street in 1991.<ref name="HD_101900"/> These developments were mostly suburban in nature and was not conductive to improvements in downtown Huntington. A [[Holiday Inn]] was constructed adjacent to the [[Big Sandy Superstore Arena]] between 8th and 9th Street in 1998. <ref name="HD_101900"/>

=== Intermodal facility ===
In 1998, $27 million for an intermodal facility was appropriated from [[United States Congress|Congress]]; an additional $6.7 million came from state and local funding. <ref>Ross, Jim. "New facility could alter downtown." Herald-Dispatch [Huntington] 19 Feb. 1999. 2 Jan. 2007.</ref> Then Governor [[Cecil Underwood]] had promised $700,000 in 1999, with local lawmakers funding the additional $1.3 million; <ref name="HD_052299">"Huntington given more cash." ''Herald-Dispatch'' [Huntington] 22 May, 1999. 2 Jan. 2007.</ref> an additional $4 million was to be allocated from the state over the next two years.

The proposed facility was for a [[Tri-State Transit Authority]] (TTA) bus transfer station, retail development and associated parking structures and would occupy a two-block surface parking lot between 8th Street and 10th Street along 3rd Avenue. A later study by ''Woolpert'' suggested at least {{convert|150000|sqft|m2|-3|abbr=on}} of retail and a parking structure that has 800 to 1,400 spaces.  Yet another study suggested that retail, entertainment, dining, housing, cultural, and educational aspects be included in the project. <ref>Koch, Joseph. "Superblock a key component." ''Herald-Dispatch'' [Huntington] 28 March, 1999. 2 Jan. 2007.</ref> A ground breaking ceremony was planned in early 2000 with initial completion of the project in 2001. <ref>Terry, Edward. "Cash crunch hinders Superblock." Herald-Dispatch [Huntington] 18 Feb. 1999. 2 Jan. 2007.</ref>

In order to complete the ''Superblock'', Chi-Chi's would need to be evicted, however, it was granted and opportunity to have a restaurant within the proposed development. <ref name="HD_022299"/> Chi-Chi's refused to leave the ''Superblock'', however, citing that they wanted to "upgrade and remodel" the restaurant.

In 1999, [[Robert C. Byrd]] allocated $8 million to federal appropriation bills for the ''Superblock'' project. <ref name="HD_052299"/> Another $400,000 was allocated from the [[Federal Transit Administration]] to the ''Huntington Transit Authority'' for the feasibility study and master plan for the intermodal facility.

=== Pullman Square ===
On September 30, 1999, it was announced that the ''Huntington Urban Renewal Authority'' was in negotiations with the ''Transit Authority'' and an unnamed [[Columbus, Ohio]] developer for the Superblock. <ref>Terry, Edward. "Superblock progressing, chief says." Herald-Dispatch [Huntington] 1 Oct. 1999. 2 Jan. 2007.</ref> In early October, President [[Bill Clinton]] signed the ''Transportation Appropriations'' bill, which provided an additional $12 million in funds for the intermodal facility. <ref>Terry, Edward. "Superblock." Herald-Dispatch [Huntington] 16 Oct. 1999. 2 Jan. 2007.</ref>

On October 18, 2000, ''Steiner + Associates'' (dropped in favor of ''Metropolitan Partners'' with the same developers), a [[Columbus, Ohio]] developer that specializes in recreating downtown urban environments, announced a $60 million {{convert|200000|sqft|m2|-4|abbr=on}}. retail and entertainment complex between 10th streets and 3rd Avenue and Veterans Memorial Boulevard that would resemble an "old-time small town" and would fit within the "historic context of the existing downtown." <ref>Ross, Jim. "Developer unveils plans for $60 million complex." Herald-Dispatch [Huntington], Oct. 19, 2000. March 21, 2007.</ref><ref>Ross, Jim. "Superblock plans revealed today." Herald-Dispatch [Huntington] 18 Oct. 2000. 2 Jan. 2007.</ref> The developers had previously constructed similar developments in [[Newport, Kentucky]] with the completion of [[Newport on the Levee]] and [[Easton Town Center]] in Columbus. The project would include stores, restaurants and a 12 to 16-screen [[movie theater]] and would open in fall of 2002. <ref>Tarbett, Jean. "Shoppers." Herald-Dispatch [Huntington] 19 Oct. 2000. 2 Jan. 2007.</ref> Two [[parking structure]]s would be constructed as well. The parking structure between 8th and 9th Street would be four-levels and include 940 parking spaces, but could be expanded upward to include an office tower; the parking structure between 9th and 10th Streets would be three-levels and include the movie complex on top. <ref>Ross, Jim. "Developer unveils plans for $60 million complex." Herald-Dispatch [Huntington] 19 Oct. 2000. 2 Jan. 2007.</ref> Broken down, the project plan included, <ref>{{cite web | title="Development Program/Merchandising Mix" | publisher=''Pullman Square'' | url=http://www.pullman-square.com/program.html | date=2002 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20030628034619/http://www.pullman-square.com/program.html |archivedate=2003-06-28}} </ref>

* {{convert|25000|sqft|m2|-2|abbr=on}} of entertainment, and 
* a 2,300-seat, {{convert|50000|sqft|m2|-3|abbr=on}} theater.

The plan included narrowing 3rd Avenue from four-lanes westbound towards the [[Robert C. Byrd Bridge]] to one-lane in each direction with angled parking, however, this was later revised to one-lane in each direction with parallel parking and a center variable lane. <ref>Gorczyca, Beth. "Before it gets spiffy, 3rd will be messy." ''Herald-Dispatch'' [Huntington] 19 Oct. 2000. 2 Jan. 2007.</ref> The road narrowing plan was envisioned as a [[traffic calming]] measure.

In January 2002, the ''Huntington Urban Renewal Authority'' began [[eminent domain]] proceedings against ''Chi-Chi's''. <ref>Ross, Jim. "Schedule tightens on Pullman." Herald-Dispatch [Huntington] 24 Jan. 2002. 2 Jan. 2007.</ref> The parent company of ''Chi-Chi's'', ''Prandium Inc.'', had refused to sell the property and rejected the city's final offer on October 19, 2000 and refused all negotiations and communications with the ''Authority'' and with ''Metropolitan Partners''. In March, ''Prandium Inc.'' refused an offer of $975,000 for the property plus $200,000 in relocation costs, which was over the appraised value of the property. <ref>Ross, Jim. "Chi-Chi's." Herald-Dispatch [Huntington] 9 March, 2002. 2 Jan. 2007.</ref> The company requested a sale price of $2 million instead.  The company, however, went into [[Chapter 11]] bankruptcy reorganization in March. In May, ''Chi-Chi's'' wanted to sell the property for $1.15 million, including undisclosed costs for relocation and loss of business, <ref>Ross, Jim. "Chi-Chi's." ''Herald-Dispatch'' [Huntington] 2 May, 2002. 2 Jan. 2007.</ref> but later reversed out of the deal and wanted $1.75 million. <ref name="HD_032703">Ross, Jim. "Superblock land sold to Pullman Square developers." ''Herald-Dispatch'' [Huntington] 27 March, 2003. 2 Jan. 2007.</ref>

During November 2002, ''Metropolitan Partners'' filed a grant request to the ''West Virginia Economic Development Grant Committee''. <ref name="HD_032703"/> It received $10.6 million in infrastructure improvements. <ref name="HD_100503">Ross, Jim. "Development in limbo." ''Herald-Dispatch'' [Huntington] 5 Oct., 2003. 2 Jan. 2007.</ref> A lawsuit was later filed by the [[Jackson County, West Virginia]] lawyer Larry Harless, questioning the legality of the committee and its work. Eventually, the [[Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia]] nullified the grant process and the grants that were given.

On March 26, 2003, the ''Superblock'' was sold to the developers of ''Pullman Square'', ''Metropolitan Partners''. <ref name="HD_032703"/> Chi-Chi's had until April 15 to vacate; it was demolished on the 29th. <ref>Ross, Jim. "Demolition makes way for Pullman." ''Herald-Dispatch'' [Huntington] 30 April, 2003. 2 Jan. 2007.</ref> The opening date had been pushed back from spring to summer 2004 due to a court case that was being considered by the [[Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia|West Virginia Supreme Court]]. In July 2003, the [[West Virginia Legislature]] passed legislation that withstood the ''Court of Appeals'', however, the ''Pullman Square'' project had to be re-approved by the reconstituted grant committee. <ref name="HD_071303">{{cite news | last=Cantley-Falk | first=Rebeccah | title=Work to begin Monday at Pullman site | publisher=''[[Herald-Dispatch]]'' | date=2003-07-13 }}</ref> The grant money was once again awarded in August,<ref name="HD_100503"/>  however, two citizens' lawsuits by Larry Harless once again disputed the process. In their case, they stated that the state may provide loans to the projects but not to the grants, and questioned the legality of the [[West Virginia Lottery|state's]] video lottery. The ''West Virginia Economic Development Grant Committee'' was to finance the grants by selling bonds which would be repaid from profits on video lottery.

On October 17, 2003, the state Supreme Court ruled that the state could proceed with the sale of bonds financing ''Pullman Square'' and 48 other projects throughout the state. <ref>"Ruling clears way for local projects." Herald-Dispatch [Huntington] 18 Oct., 2003. 2 Jan. 2007.</ref>

=== Construction and opening===
Construction began on Pullman Square on July 16, 2004 with the excavation of the parking lot for the parking structures. <ref name="HD_071303"/> It opened on November 19, 2004 with [[Marquee Cinemas]]. <ref name="HD_112004">{{cite news| title="TODAY'S SPOTLIGHT: PULLMAN SQUARE" | author=Chambers, Bryan | date=2004-11-20 | publisher=[[The Herald-Dispatch]] }}</ref> Others, such as Empire Books & News, [[EB Games]] and [[Starbucks]], opened in early December. <ref name="HD_061605">"Pullman progress."

A few months after opening, the [[Uno Chicago Grill]] was sued for not paying the builders, suppliers, and utilities. <ref name="HD_061607"/> It soon changed its name to La Sha's [[West Virginia Lottery|West Virginia]] Bistro and was headed by [[Powerball]] winner [[Jack Whittaker (lottery winner)|Jack Whittaker]]; however, it closed on February 22, 2007 after another lawsuit was filed after Metropolitan Huntington LLC complained that the ''Bistro'' owed thousands for rent. <ref name="HD_022207">{{cite news |first= Tarbett |last= Hardiman |title= Bistro closes doors at Pullman Square |work= Herald-Dispatch [Huntington] |date= 2007-02-22 |accessdate= 2007-03-21 }}</ref><ref name="HD_061607"/>

On March 17 Runway Couture opened next to Inspired, featuring west coast-inspired fashions; both are owned by Deneene Chafin.  Moe's Southwest Grill maintained goodfaith talks with Pullman Square and after protracted negotiations Metropolitan Partners agreed to [http://www.moes.com Moe's Southwest Grill] corporate lease arrangements and subsequently surrendered the keys to the former location on November 5, 2007.

On May 8, 2008, it was announced that Community Trust Bank would locate a bank branch at the corner of 3rd Avenue and 10th Street. It would include spaces for more retail that is currently "under negotiations". <ref name="HD_050807">{{cite news |first= Tarbett |last= Hardiman |title= Feds approve bank branch at Pullman |work= ''Herald-Dispatch'' [Huntington] |date= 2007-05-08 |accessdate= 2007-05-08 }}</ref> Construction began in August.
