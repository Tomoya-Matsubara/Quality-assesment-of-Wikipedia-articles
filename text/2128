This is a '''list of the bird species recorded in Nicaragua'''. The avifauna of [[Nicaragua]] includes a total of 699 species, of which 1 is [[Endemism in birds|endemic]], 2 have been [[Introduced species|introduced]] by humans, and 14 are rare or accidental. 8 species are globally threatened.

This list's [[Taxonomy|taxonomic]] treatment (designation and sequence of orders, families, and species) and nomenclature (common and scientific names) follow the conventions of [[James Clements|Clements]]'s 5th edition. The family accounts at the beginning of each heading reflects this taxonomy, as do the species counts found in each family account. Introduced and accidental species are included in the total counts for Nicaragua.

The following tags have been used to highlight certain relevant categories. It must be noted that not all species fall into one of these categories. Those that do not are commonly occurring, native species.

* (A) '''Accidental''' A species that rarely or accidentally occurs in Nicaragua.
* (E) '''Endemic''' A species endemic to Nicaragua.
* (I) '''Introduced''' A species introduced to Nicaragua as a consequence, direct or indirect, of human actions.
