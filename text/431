'''Craig William Levein''' (born [[22 October]] [[1964]] in [[Dunfermline]]) is a [[Scotland|Scottish]] former professional [[football (soccer)|footballer]] and current [[Coach (sport)|football manager]]. Levein currently manages [[Scottish Premier League]] club [[Dundee United F.C.|Dundee United]]. During his playing career he played for [[Cowdenbeath F.C.|Cowdenbeath]], [[Heart of Midlothian F.C.|Heart of Midlothian]] and won 16 [[cap (football)|caps]] for the [[Scotland national football team|Scotland national team]].

==Playing career==
As a youth, Levein attended [[Inverkeithing High School]], where he was in the football team alongside another future Scottish international footballer, [[Gordon Durie]]. His early football career saw him turn out for [[Dalgety Bay]], Leven Royals and Inverkeithing under-16s. At the age of 15, however, he gave up football for a year, only resuming when his brother, who played for [[Scottish Junior Football Association|junior]] club [[Lochore Welfare F.C.|Lochore Welfare]] invited him to training there. Levein subsequently signed for Lochore and after trials with several senior clubs he finally joined Cowdenbeath in 1981.<ref> [http://www.cowdenbeath.free-online.co.uk/facts/craiglev.htm The Rampant Ballboy Interviews - Craig Levein], article from ''When the Sun Shines'' fanzine, reproduced by blue-brazil.co.uk. Retrieved on [[1 November]] [[2006]]</ref>

Levein quickly established himself in the first team at [[Central Park, Cowdenbeath|Central Park]] and soon became a target for larger clubs than Cowdenbeath. In 1983 he moved to Heart of Midlothian for a fee of <U+00A3>40,000 and soon found himself a regular place in the Hearts first team. He made his Scotland debut in March 1990, a 1-0 win against [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] at [[Hampden Park]] and played well enough to earn a place in Scotland's [[1990 World Cup]] squad.

His playing career was punctuated by two separate serious knee ligament injuries, which eventually forced him into early retirement in 1995. However, it was not just injuries that kept Levein from playing during his time at Hearts; he was once given a 12-game ban after punching, and breaking the nose of, Hearts teammate [[Graeme Hogg]] during a pre-season friendly against [[Raith Rovers F.C.|Raith Rovers]].

==Coaching and managerial career==
After being forced into retirement as a player, Levein had coaching positions at Hearts and at [[Livingston F.C.|Livingston]]. In November 1997 he was appointed as manager of [[Cowdenbeath F.C.|Cowdenbeath]] and turned a struggling team into one that could challenge for promotion. Cowdenbeath were promoted in 2001, but Levein had left in December 2000 to take over as manager at Hearts.

His time in charge of Hearts was highly successful, where he guided them to third place in the SPL in two successive seasons and thus guided them into European competition. His impressive record in Scotland caught the attention of [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] who appointed him as manager on [[19 October]], [[2004]].<ref name="Leicester appointment">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/3960105.stm|publisher=BBC Sport website|title=Leicester appoint Levein as boss|date=29 October, 2004}}</ref>

However after a poor start to the [[2005-06 in English football|2005-06 season]], which left the club languishing third from bottom in the [[Football League Championship|Championship]] relegation zone, he was sacked as manager on [[25 January]], [[2006]].<ref name="Leicester depart">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/l/leicester_city/4648436.stm|publisher=BBC Sport website|title=Levein and Leicester part company|date=25 January 2006}}</ref>

Levein was appointed as manager of [[Scottish Second Division]] club [[Raith Rovers FC|Raith Rovers]] on [[5 September]], [[2006]], on a non-contract basis.<ref name="Raith appointment">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/r/raith_rovers/5306266.stm|publisher=BBC Sport website|title=Raith appoint Levein as manager|date=5 September 2006}}</ref> However, after Dundee United parted company with [[Craig Brewster]], Levein left his non-contract role at Raith Rovers to take up the job at [[Tannadice Park|Tannadice]]. He was unveiled to the press on [[October 30]] [[2006]].<ref name="Dundee Utd appointment">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/d/dundee_utd/6099414.stm|publisher=BBC Sport website|title=Dundee Utd unveil Levein as boss|date=30 October 2006}}</ref>

Levein guided United to four successive home victories, earning him 'Manager of the Month' for [[November 2006]], later repeating the award in [[March 2007]].
