'''''Enola Gay''''' is the [[B-29 Superfortress]] [[bomber]] that dropped "[[Little Boy]]", the first [[Nuclear weapon|atomic bomb]] ever used in [[warfare]], when the [[United States Army Air Forces]] (USAAF) attacked [[Hiroshima, Hiroshima|Hiroshima]], [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] on [[August 6]], [[1945]], just before the end of [[World War II]]. Because of its role in the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bombings of Japan]], its name has been synonymous with the controversy over the bombings themselves. The plane gained additional national attention in 1994 when an exhibit at the [[National Air and Space Museum]] of the [[Smithsonian Institution]] was changed due to a controversy over its historical script. In [[2003]], ''Enola Gay'' went on display at NASM's new [[Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center]] annex near [[Washington Dulles International Airport|Dulles International Airport]] in Virginia.

==Bombing of Hiroshima==
''Enola Gay'' (B-29-45-MO, serial number 44-86292, [[Unit identification aircraft markings#XXI Bomber Command|victor number]] 82) was assigned to the USAAF's 393rd Bomb Squadron, [[509th Composite Group]] and flew the [[August 6]] mission out of [[Tinian]], a large [[island]] with several USAAF bases in the [[Mariana Islands]] chain. The plane was one of 15 B-29s with the final "[[Silverplate]]" modifications necessary to deliver nuclear bombs. ''Enola Gay'' was built by the [[Glenn L. Martin Company]] at its [[Omaha, Nebraska]], plant and personally selected by Colonel [[Paul Tibbets|Paul W. Tibbets, Jr.]], commander of the 509th Composite Group, on [[May 9]], [[1945]] while still on the [[assembly line]] as the B-29 he would use to fly the atomic bomb mission.

The airplane was accepted by the USAAF on [[May 18]], [[1945]], and assigned to Crew B-9 (Capt. Robert Lewis, aircraft commander), who flew the plane from Omaha to the 509th's base at [[Wendover Army Air Field]], [[Utah]], on [[June 14]], [[1945]]. Thirteen days later it left Wendover for [[Guam]], where it received a bomb bay modification, and flew to Tinian on [[July 6]]. It was assigned victor number 12, which was later changed to 82. After flying eight training missions and two combat missions during July, the plane was used on [[July 31]] on a rehearsal for the actual mission, with a dummy [[Little Boy]] assembly dropped off Tinian.

On [[August 5]], [[1945]], during preparation for the first atomic mission, Tibbets had the plane named after his mother, Enola Gay Tibbets (1893&ndash;1983, who had been named for the heroine of a novel). According to [[Gordon Thomas]] and [[Max Morgan-Witts]] (''Enola Gay'', Stein & Day Pub, 1977), regularly assigned aircraft commander Robert Lewis was unhappy to be displaced by Tibbets for the important mission, and furious when he arrived at the aircraft on the morning of [[6 August]] to see it painted with the now-famous nose art. Tibbets himself, interviewed on Tinian later that day by war correspondents, confessed that he was a bit embarrassed at having attached his mother's name to such a fateful mission.

The Hiroshima mission has been described as tactically flawless, and ''Enola Gay'' returned safely to its base on Tinian to great fanfare on the base. The first atomic bombing was followed three days later by another B-29 (''[[Bockscar]]'') (piloted by Major [[Charles W. Sweeney]]) which dropped a second nuclear weapon, "[[Fat Man]]", on [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]]. The Nagasaki mission, by contrast, has been described as tactically botched; although it met its objectives, it encountered a number of mistakes in execution and ''[[Bockscar]]'' had barely enough fuel to make an emergency landing on Okinawa. On that mission ''Enola Gay'', flown by Crew B-10 (Capt. George Marquardt, aircraft commander, see ''[[Necessary Evil]]'' for crew details), was the weather reconnaissance aircraft for Kokura.
 
==Subsequent history==
On [[November 6]], [[1945]], Lewis flew the ''Enola Gay'' back to the United States, arriving at the 509th's new base at [[Walker Air Force Base|Roswell Army Air Field]], [[New Mexico]], on [[November 8]]. On [[April 29]], [[1946]], ''Enola Gay'' left Roswell as part of [[Operation Crossroads]] and flew to [[Kwajalein]] on [[May 1]]. It was not chosen to make the test drop at [[Bikini Atoll]] and left Kwajalein on [[July 1]], the date of the test, and reached [[Travis Air Force Base|Fairfield-Suisun Army Air Field]], [[California]], the next day. 

The decision was made to preserve the aircraft and on [[July 24]], [[1946]], it was flown to [[Davis-Monthan Air Force Base]], [[Arizona]], to prepare it for storage. On [[August 30]] title to the aircraft was transferred to the [[Smithsonian Institution]] and it was removed from the USAAF inventory. It then went through temporary storage at a variety of locations:
*[[September 1]], [[1946]], Davis-Monthan AFB
*[[July 3]], [[1949]], [[O'Hare International Airport|Orchard Place Air Field]], [[Park Ridge, Illinois]], flown there by Gen. Tibbets for acceptance by the Smithsonian.
*[[January 12]], [[1952]], Pyote Air Force Base, Texas, moved after O'Hare's location was announced
*[[December 2]], [[1953]], [[Andrews Air Force Base]], Maryland
*[[August 10]], [[1960]], disassembly at Andrews begun by personnel of the Smithsonian
*[[July 21]], [[1961]], components transported to Smithsonian storage facility at [[Suitland, Maryland]].

Restoration was finally begun on [[December 5]], [[1984]], at the Paul E. Garber Preservation, Restoration, and Storage Facility in Suitland.

==Recent developments==
''Enola Gay'' became the center of a controversy at the [[Smithsonian Institution]] in 1994, when the museum put its fuselage on display as part of an exhibit commemorating the 50th anniversary of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima. The exhibit, 'The Crossroads: The End of World War II, the Atomic Bomb and the Cold War' was drafted by the Smithsonian's [[National Air and Space Museum]] and arranged around a restored version of ''Enola Gay''. Critics, especially the [[American Legion]] and the [[Air Force Association]], charged that the exhibit focused too much on the casualties wrought by the bomb rather than on the motivations for the bombing or discussion of its role in ending the war. The exhibit brought to national attention many long-standing academic and political issues related to retrospective views of the bombings (see ''[[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]]''), and in the end, after attempts to revise the exhibit to meet the satisfaction of competing interest groups, the exhibit was cancelled on [[January 30]], [[1995]], though the fuselage did go on display. On [[May 18]], [[1998]], the fuselage was returned to the Garber Facility for final restoration.

The entire plane has since been restored for static display and is currently a major permanent exhibit at the National Air and Space Museum's [[Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center]] near Dulles International Airport outside Washington, D.C. As a result of the earlier controversy, the signage around the plane provides only the same succinct technical data as other aircraft in the museum, without discussion of controversial issues. The aircraft is shielded by various means to prevent a repetition of vandalism which was attempted against it when it was first placed on display.

The four lightweight aluminum variable pitch propellers that were used on the bombing mission to save weight ended up at Texas A&M University. One of them, trimmed to 12.5 feet, provides the thrust for the Oran W. Nicks Low Speed Wind Tunnel. A 1250 kVA electric motor provides constant revolutions (900 RPM) and the propeller's pitch/yaw is changed to control the wind-speed (up to 200 mph) in the tunnel.
