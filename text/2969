"'''Soul Sound'''" is a song by British [[girl group]] [[Sugababes]] from their debut studio album ''[[One Touch (album)|One Touch]]'' (2000). It was written by [[Charlotte Gordon Cumming]] during a trip to [[Kenya]], Africa, where she was inspired to compose it based on her experiences there. Produced by Ron Tom, "Soul Sound" is a [[pop music|pop song]] featuring guitar and bass [[instrumentation (music)|instrumentation]]. It was released in the United Kingdom on 16 July 2001 as the album's fourth and final single. Critics praised the song for the group's demeanour although some regarded it as inferior in comparison to the album's other tracks.

To promote the song, a [[music video]] was directed by Max & Dania; it features the Sugababes in an apartment where their souls are released by the music. The trio performed "Soul Sound" at Manchester Ampersand and at the London [[Leicester Square Theatre|Notre Dame Hall]]. The song became the group's lowest-charting single at the time, peaking at number thirty on the [[UK Singles Chart]], and remains one of their lowest-selling singles to date. It was the final single that they released through [[London Records]], and their last single to feature original member [[Siobh<U+00E1>n Donaghy]], who left the group in 2001.

==Background and composition==
{{Quote box|width=29%|align=left|quote="I hung out with the girls for a year while they recorded their album. I was shocked by how young they were. But they were lovely and it was really interesting for me to watch them grow and develop as artists. I am so pleased and proud to be able to say I was a part of that. Ideally that's what I want to be able to do. I like performing but what would please me more is just to write songs and see other people covering them."|source=<U+2014>Charlotte Gordon Cumming.<ref name="Daily Record">{{cite news|last=Booth|first=Samantha|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-145045037.html|title=I'll keep writing my songs for Art's sake|work=[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]|date=28 April 2006|accessdate=15 May 2013}} {{subscription}}</ref>}}

Cumming had spent a year with the [[Sugababes]] while they recorded their debut studio album ''[[One Touch (album)|One Touch]]'' (2000); according to the ''[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]'', the trio's management were desperate for them to sing "Soul Sound".<ref name="Daily Record"/> The song was [[Record producer|produced]] by Ron Tom, who [[mixing (music production)|mixed]] and [[Programming (music)|programmed]] it in collaboration with Mark Frank.<ref name="One Touch"/> Individuals who provide [[backing vocals]] on the song include Xavier Barnet and the Kenyan-born British singer [[Lamya]].<ref name="One Touch"/> "Soul Sound" was recorded at the Matrix Recording Studios in London, England.<ref name="One Touch"/>

===Live performances===
The Sugababes played "Soul Sound" on 27 March 2001 at Manchester Ampersand, in conjunction with many of the album's tracks such as "Overload" and "[[Run for Cover (song)|Run for Cover]]".<ref name="NME 2">{{cite web|last=Empire|first=Kitty|authorlink=Kitty Empire|url=http://www.nme.com/reviews/4522|title=Sugababes: Manchester Ampersand|work=NME|publisher=IPC Media|date=28 March 2001|accessdate=16 May 2013|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6GeBFh2qY|archivedate=16 May 2013}}</ref> This was their second-ever live performance, which was sponsored by ''NME''. Donaghy commented,

{{quote|We were very lucky that the tour was done in conjunction with ''NME'', and it meant that we were playing to an older audience. We never set out to appeal to under-10s, because of the kind of stuff we listened to ourselves. If we manage to incorporate even a hint of that in our own music, we should appeal to quite an adult audience. We were all very nervous at all the gigs, but that was just because we were so worried about it going well.<ref name="NME 2"/>}}

According to [[Kitty Empire]] of ''NME'', during the performance, "'Soul Sound' [grew] lovelier with every croon of its chorus".<ref name="NME 2"/> Later that month, the trio performed the song at London's [[Leicester Square Theatre|Notre Dame Hall]] as part of a [[set list]].<ref name="The Guardian">{{cite news|last=Aizlewood|first=John|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2001/mar/31/artsfeatures|title=Sugababes prove they can sing|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian News & Media]]|date=31 March 2001|accessdate=16 May 2013|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6GeBmECQZ|archivedate=16 May 2013}}</ref> ''[[The Guardian]]''{{'}}s John Aizlewood commented that during its performance, the group "[created] a tidal wave of melody".<ref name="The Guardian"/>

==Impact==
The group's members were dissatisfied with the release of "Soul Sound" as a single, because they wanted to venture into an [[contemporary|R&B]] sound whereas their record label [[London Records]] pushed them into a more [[pop music|pop]] direction.<ref name="Liverpool Daily Post">{{cite news|last=Gould|first=Phil|url=http://www.liverpooldailypost.co.uk/liverpool-culture/liverpool-arts/2002/04/26/the-kitten-who-then-became-a-sugababe-92534-11821936/|title=The Kitten who then became a Sugababe|work=[[Liverpool Daily Post]]|publisher=Trinity Mirror|date=26 April 2002|accessdate=16 May 2013|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6GeCIKGzM|archivedate=16 May 2013}}</ref> Soon after the song's release, Donaghy left the group and was replaced by former [[Atomic Kitten]] member [[Heidi Range]], making it the last Sugababes single to feature her vocals.<ref>Sheridan, 2007. pp 81<U+2013>82.</ref> Further, the sales of ''One Touch'' and its last three singles, "[[New Year (song)|New Year]]", "[[Run for Cover (song)|Run for Cover]]" and "Soul Sound", failed to meet the expectations of London Records and the group was subsequently dropped.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/04/27/1051381844300.html|title=Sweet as...|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|publisher=[[Fairfax Media]]|date=28 April 2003|accessdate=17 May 2013|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20030428172001/http://smh.com.au/articles/2003/04/27/1051381844300.html|archivedate=28 April 2003}}</ref><ref name="BBC">{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4548326.stm|title=Colourful past of pop's Sugababes|work={{noitalic|[[BBC News]]}}|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=21 December 2005|accessdate=24 February 2013|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20051226060714/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4548326.stm|archivedate=26 December 2005}}</ref> Band member [[Keisha Buchanan]] has stated that the song's release and subsequent commercial underperformance was a positive experience because, saying: "Everything happens for a reason and it looks like it has all worked out".<ref name="Liverpool Daily Post"/> "Soul Sound" was featured in the 2001 film ''[[Summer Catch]]'', which stars such actors as [[Freddie Prinze, Jr.]] and [[Jessica Biel]].<ref name="Billboard"/>
