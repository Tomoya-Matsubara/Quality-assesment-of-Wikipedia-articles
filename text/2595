'''Ringo Starr''' {{small|[[Order of the British Empire|MBE]]}} (born '''Richard Starkey'''; 7 July 1940) is an English musician, singer, songwriter and actor who gained worldwide fame as the drummer for [[the Beatles]]. On most of the band's albums, he sang lead vocals for one song, including "[[With a Little Help from My Friends]]", "[[Yellow Submarine (song)|Yellow Submarine]]" and their [[Cover version|cover]] of "[[Act Naturally]]". He also wrote the Beatles' songs "[[Don't Pass Me By]]" and "[[Octopus's Garden]]", and is credited as a co-writer of others, such as "[[What Goes On (Beatles song)|What Goes On]]" and "[[Flying (Beatles song)|Flying]]".

Starr was twice afflicted by life-threatening illnesses during his childhood, and as a result of prolonged hospitalisations, fell behind scholastically. In 1955, he entered the workforce and briefly held a position with [[British Rail]] before securing an [[apprenticeship]] at a Liverpool equipment manufacturer. Soon afterwards, he became interested in the UK [[skiffle]] craze, developing a fervent admiration for the [[genre]]. In 1957, he cofounded his first band, the Eddie Clayton Skiffle Group, and they earned several prestigious local bookings before the fad succumbed to American [[rock and roll]] by early 1958.

When the Beatles formed in 1960, Starr was a member of another [[Liverpool]] group, [[Rory Storm#Rory Storm and the Hurricanes|Rory Storm and the Hurricanes]]. After achieving moderate success with them in the UK and [[Hamburg]], he quit the Hurricanes and joined the Beatles in August 1962, replacing [[Pete Best]]. Starr played key roles in [[The Beatles in film|the Beatles' films]] and appeared in numerous others. After [[Break-up of the Beatles|their break-up]] in 1970, he released several successful singles including the US number four hit "[[It Don't Come Easy]]", and number ones "[[Photograph (Ringo Starr song)|Photograph"]] and "[[You're Sixteen]]". In 1972, he released his most successful UK single, "[[Back Off Boogaloo]]", which peaked at number two. He achieved commercial and critical success with his 1973 album ''[[Ringo (album)|Ringo]]'', which was a top ten release in both the UK and the US. Although he continued to record and remained a familiar celebrity presence, by 1975 his solo career had diminished in importance. He has been featured in a number of documentaries, hosted television shows, narrated the first two seasons of the children's television series ''[[Thomas & Friends]]'' and portrayed "Mr Conductor" during the first season of the [[PBS]] children's television series ''[[Shining Time Station]]''. Since 1989, he has successfully toured with twelve variations of [[Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band]].

Starr's creative contribution to music has received praise from drummers such as [[Phil Collins]] and [[Steve Smith (musician)|Steve Smith]], who commented: "Before Ringo, drum stars were measured by their soloing ability and virtuosity. Ringo's popularity brought forth a new paradigm&nbsp;... we started to see the drummer as an equal participant in the compositional aspect&nbsp;... His parts are so signature to the songs that you can listen to a Ringo drum part without the rest of the music and still identify the song."<ref name="PAS"/> In 2011, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' readers named Starr the fifth-greatest drummer of all time.

Richard Starkey was born on 7 July 1940, at 9 Madryn Street, [[Dingle, Liverpool]], Lancashire, England, the son of confectioners Elsie (n<U+00E9>e Gleave) and Richard Starkey.<ref>{{harvnb|Clayson|2005|pp=15<U+2013>16}}: Born at 9 Madryn Street, parent's occupations; {{harvnb|Davies|2009|p=142}}; {{harvnb|Spitz|2005|pp=332<U+2013>333}}.</ref>{{refn|group=nb|His paternal grandfather was born with the surname "[[Parkin (surname)|Parkin]]", and later adopted his stepfather's surname, "Starkey".{{sfn|Davies|2009|p=141}}}} Elsie enjoyed singing and dancing, a hobby that she shared with her husband, an avid fan of [[Swing (dance)|swing]].{{sfn|Spitz|2005|pp=332<U+2013>333}} Prior to the birth of their son, whom they nicknamed "Ritchie", the couple had spent much of their free time on the local ballroom circuit, but soon after his birth their regular outings ended.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|pp=333<U+2013>334}} Elsie adopted an overprotective approach to raising her son that bordered on fixation. Subsequently, "Big Ritchie", as Starkey's father became known, lost interest in his family, choosing instead to spend long hours drinking and dancing in pubs, sometimes for several consecutive days.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|pp=333<U+2013>334}}

In 1944, in an effort to reduce their housing costs, his family moved to another neighbourhood in the Dingle, [[10 Admiral Grove]]; soon afterwards, his parents separated, and they divorced within the year.<ref>{{harvnb|Clayson|2005|p=17}}: Moving to 10 Admiral Grove in an effort to reduce their rent payments; {{harvnb|Davies|2009|p=142}}: his parents separated; {{harvnb|Spitz|2005|p=334}}: divorced within the year.</ref> Starkey later stated that he has "no real memories" of his father, who made little effort to bond with him, visiting as few as three times thereafter.<ref>{{harvnb|Davies|2009|p=142}}: Visiting as few as three times thereafter; {{harvnb|Spitz|2005|p=334}}: "no real memories" of his father.</ref> Elsie found it difficult to survive on her ex-husband's support payments of thirty shillings a week, so she took on several menial jobs cleaning houses before securing a position as a local barmaid, an occupation that she enjoyed for twelve years.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|pp=334<U+2013>335}}

At age six Starkey developed [[appendicitis]]. Following a routine [[appendectomy]] he contracted [[peritonitis]], causing him to fall into a coma that lasted for three days.<ref>{{harvnb|Clayson|2005|p=21}}; {{harvnb|Spitz|2005|pp=336<U+2013>337}}.</ref> His recovery spanned twelve months, which he spent away from his family at Liverpool's Myrtle Street [[Children's hospital]].<ref>{{harvnb|Clayson|2005|p=21}}; {{harvnb|Davies|2009|pp=143<U+2013>144}}.</ref> Upon his discharge in May 1948, his mother allowed him to stay home, causing him to miss school.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=337}} At age eight, he remained [[Literacy|illiterate]], with a poor grasp of mathematics.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=337}} His lack of education contributed to a feeling of alienation at school, which resulted in him regularly [[Truancy|playing truant]] at [[Sefton Park]].<ref>{{harvnb|Spitz|2005|p=337}}: a feeling of alienation at school; {{harvnb|Davies|2009|p=145}}: Sefton Park.</ref> After several years of twice weekly tutoring from his surrogate sister and neighbour, Marie Maguire Crawford, Starkey had nearly caught up to his peers academically, but in 1953, he contracted [[tuberculosis]] and was admitted to a [[sanatorium]], where he remained for two years.<ref>{{harvnb|Clayson|2005|p=17}}: His surrogate sister Marie Maguire; {{harvnb|Spitz|2005|pp=332<U+2013>339}}: tuberculosis and the sanatorium.</ref> During his stay the medical staff made an effort to stimulate motor activity and relieve boredom by encouraging their patients to join the hospital band, leading to his first exposure to a percussion instrument; a makeshift [[percussion mallet|mallet]] made from a cotton [[bobbin]] that he used to strike the cabinets next to his bed.<ref>{{harvnb|The Beatles|2000|p=36}}: (primary source); {{harvnb|Spitz|2005|pp=338<U+2013>339}}: (secondary source).</ref> Soon afterwards, he grew increasingly interested in drumming, receiving a copy of the [[Alyn Ainsworth]] song "Bedtime for Drums" as a convalescence gift from Crawford.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=339}} Starkey commented: "I was in the hospital band&nbsp;... That's where I really started playing. I never wanted anything else from there on&nbsp;... My grandparents gave me a mandolin and a banjo, but I didn't want them. My grandfather gave me a harmonica&nbsp;... we had a piano&nbsp;<U+2013> nothing. Only the drums."{{sfn|The Beatles|2000|p=36}}

Starkey attended St Silas, a [[Church of England]] primary school near his house where his classmates nicknamed him "[[Lazarus of Bethany|Lazarus]]", and later Dingle Vale [[Secondary modern school]], where he showed an aptitude for art and drama, as well as practical subjects including mechanics.<ref>{{harvnb|Clayson|2005|pp=22<U+2013>23}}: classmates nicknamed Starr "Lazarus"; {{harvnb|Davies|2009|pp=145<U+2013>147}}: Dingle Vale Secondary Modern; {{harvnb|Gould|2007|p=125}}: St Silas primary school.</ref> As a result of the prolonged hospitalisations, he fell behind his peers scholastically and was ineligible for the [[Eleven plus exam|11-plus]] qualifying examination required for attendance at a [[grammar school]].{{sfn|Clayson|2005|p=23}} On 17 April 1953, Starkey's mother married Harry Graves, an ex-Londoner who had moved to Liverpool following the failure of his first marriage.<ref>{{harvnb|Davies|2009|p=145}}; {{harvnb|Spitz|2005|pp=339<U+2013>340}}.</ref> Graves, an impassioned fan of [[big band]] music and their vocalists, introduced Starkey to recordings by [[Dinah Shore]], [[Sarah Vaughan]] and [[Billy Daniels]].{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=340}} Graves stated that he and "Ritchie" never had an unpleasant exchange between them; Starkey later commented: "He was great&nbsp;... I learned gentleness from Harry."{{sfn|Davies|2009|p=146}} After the extended hospital stay following Starkey's recovery from tuberculosis, he did not return to school, preferring instead to stay at home and listen to music while playing along by beating [[biscuit tin]]s with sticks.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|pp=336<U+2013>339}}

Beatles biographer [[Bob Spitz]] described Starkey's upbringing as "a [[Charles Dickens|Dickensian]] chronicle of misfortune".{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=332}} Houses in the area were "poorly ventilated, postage-stamp-sized&nbsp;... patched together by crumbling plaster walls, with a rear door that opened onto an [[outhouse]]."{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=332}} Crawford commented: "Like all of the families who lived in the Dingle, he was part of an ongoing struggle to survive."{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=332}} The children who lived there spent much of their time at [[Princes Park, Liverpool|Princes Park]], escaping the soot-filled air of their coal-fuelled neighbourhood.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=332}} Adding to their difficult circumstances, violent crime was an almost constant concern for people living in one of the oldest and poorest inner-city districts in Liverpool.<ref>{{harvnb|Clayson|2005|p=16}}; {{harvnb|Davies|2009|p=141}}; {{harvnb|Spitz|2005|pp=332<U+2013>335}}.</ref> Starkey later commented: "You kept your head down, your eyes open, and you didn't get in anybody's way."{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=335}}

After his return home from the sanatorium in late 1955, Starkey entered the UK workforce, but lacking motivation and discipline, his initial attempts at gainful employment proved unsuccessful.<ref>{{harvnb|Gould|2007|p=125}}: his return from the sanatorium in 1955; {{harvnb|Spitz|2005|pp=340<U+2013>341}}.</ref> In an effort to secure himself some warm clothes, he briefly held a position at [[British Rail]], who supplied their employees with suits. They gave him a hat, but no uniform, and unable to pass the [[physical examination]], he was laid off and granted [[unemployment benefits]].<ref>{{harvnb|The Beatles|2000|p=36}}: (primary source); {{harvnb|Spitz|2005|p=340}}: (secondary source).</ref> He then found work as a waiter serving drinks on a day boat that travelled from Liverpool to North Wales, but his fear of [[conscription]] into military service led him to quit the job, not wanting to give the [[Royal Navy]] the impression that he was suitable for seafaring work.<ref>{{harvnb|The Beatles|2000|p=36}}: (primary source); {{harvnb|Spitz|2005|pp=340<U+2013>341}}: (secondary source).</ref> In mid-1956, Graves secured Starkey a position as an apprentice [[machinist]] at a Liverpool equipment manufacturer. While working at the facility Starkey befriended Roy Trafford, and the two bonded over their shared interest in music.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=341}} Trafford introduced him to [[skiffle]], and he quickly became a fervent admirer.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=341}}

Soon after Trafford piqued Starkey's interest in skiffle, the two began rehearsing songs in the manufacturing plant's cellar during their lunch breaks. Trafford recalled: "I played a guitar, and [Ritchie] just made a noise on a box&nbsp;... Sometimes, he just slapped a biscuit tin with some keys, or banged on the backs of chairs."{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=341}} The pair were joined by Starkey's neighbour and co-worker, the guitarist Eddie Miles, forming the Eddie Miles Band, later renamed Eddie Clayton and the [[Clayton Square Shopping Centre|Clayton Squares]] after a Liverpool landmark.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|pp=341<U+2013>342}} The band performed popular skiffle songs such as "[[Rock Island Line (song)|Rock Island Line]]" and "Walking Cane", with Starkey raking a [[thimble]] across a [[Washboard#Washboard as a musical instrument|washboard]], creating primitive, driving rhythms.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=342}} Starkey enjoyed dancing as his parents had years earlier, and he and Trafford briefly took dance lessons at two schools. Though the lessons were short-lived, they provided Starkey and Trafford with an introduction that allowed them to dance competently while enjoying nights out on the town.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=342}}

On Christmas Day 1957, Graves gave Starkey a second-hand drum kit consisting of a [[snare drum]], [[bass drum]] and a makeshift [[cymbal]] fashioned from an old rubbish bin lid. Although basic and crude, the kit facilitated his progression as a musician while increasing the commercial potential of the Eddie Clayton band, who went on to book several prestigious local gigs before the skiffle craze faded in early 1958 as American [[rock and roll]] became popular in the UK.<ref>{{harvnb|Clayson|2005|pp=37<U+2013>38}}: The UK skiffle craze succumbed to American [[rock and roll]] by early 1958; {{harvnb|Spitz|2005|p=343}}.</ref>

In November 1959, Starkey joined [[Rory Storm|Al Caldwell]]'s Texans, a skiffle group who were looking for someone with a proper drum kit so that the group could transition from one of Liverpool's best-known skiffle acts to a full-fledged rock and roll band.<ref>{{harvnb|Clayson|2005|p=45}}: Starr joined Storm's band in November 1959; {{harvnb|Lewisohn|1992|p=58}}: Starr joined Storm's band in November 1959; {{harvnb|Spitz|2005|pp=324, 341<U+2013>343}}.</ref>{{refn|group=nb|Starr had first drummed with the Texans on 25 March 1959, at the Mardi Gras club in Liverpool.<ref>{{harvnb|Clayson|2005|p=44}}; {{harvnb|Lewisohn|1992|p=58}}.</ref>}} They had begun playing local clubs as the Raging Texans, then Jet Storm and the Raging Texans before settling on Rory Storm and the Hurricanes soon before recruiting Starkey.<ref>{{harvnb|Clayson|2005|pp=44<U+2013>45}}; {{harvnb|Spitz|2005|pp=324, 341<U+2013>343}}.</ref> About this time he adopted the stage name Ringo Starr; derived from the rings he wore and also because it implied a country western influence.

By early 1960 the Hurricanes had become one of Liverpool's leading bands.<ref>{{harvnb|Clayson|2005|p=50}}; {{harvnb|Davies|2009|p=150}}.</ref> In May, they were offered a three-month residency at a [[Butlins]] [[holiday camp]] in Wales.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|p=58}} Although initially reluctant to accept the residency and end his five-year machinist apprenticeship that he had begun four years earlier, Starr eventually agreed to the arrangement.<ref>{{harvnb|Clayson|2005|pp=54<U+2013>55}}; {{harvnb|Davies|2009|p=150}}; {{harvnb|Spitz|2005|pp=245<U+2013>246}}.</ref> The Butlins gig led to other opportunities for the band, including an unpleasant tour of [[United States Air Force|US Air Force]] bases in France about which Starr commented: "The French don't like the British; at least I didn't like them."{{sfn|Davies|2009|p=150}} The Hurricanes became so successful that when initially offered a highly coveted residency in [[Hamburg]], they turned it down due to their prior commitment with Butlins.<ref>{{harvnb|Clayson|2005|p=54}}; {{harvnb|Davies|2009|p=150}}.</ref> They eventually accepted, joining [[the Beatles]] at [[Bruno Koschmider]]{{'}}s [[Kaiserkeller]] on 1 October 1960, where Starr first met the band.<ref>{{harvnb|Clayson|2005|p=63}}: Starr first met the Beatles in Hamburg; {{harvnb|Davies|2009|pp=150<U+2013>151}}: Starr first met the Beatles in Hamburg; {{harvnb|Harry|2004|p=302}}: Bruno Koschmider; {{harvnb|Lewisohn|1992|p=23}}: arriving in Hamburg on 1 October 1960.</ref> Storm's Hurricanes were given top-billing over the Beatles, who also received less pay.<ref>{{harvnb|Clayson|2005|p=62}}: the Hurricanes were paid more than the Beatles; {{harvnb|Harry|2004|p=302}}: the Hurricanes were given top-billing over the Beatles.</ref> Starr performed with the Beatles during a few stand-in engagements while in Hamburg.

Starr quit Rory Storm and the Hurricanes in January 1962 and briefly joined Sheridan in Hamburg before returning to the Hurricanes for a third season at Butlins.<ref>{{harvnb|Clayson|2005|p=58}}: A second season with the Hurricanes at Butlins; {{harvnb|Clayson|2005|pp=81<U+2013>82}}:  Starr quit the Hurricanes and briefly joined Sheridan in Hamburg; {{harvnb|Gould|2007|p=126}}: Starr quit the Hurricanes and briefly joined Sheridan in Hamburg.</ref>{{refn|group=nb|Starr sat in for an ill Pete Best during two shows on 5 February 1962.{{sfn|Harry|2004|p=110}}}} On 14 August, Lennon asked Starr to join the Beatles; he accepted.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|p=59}} On 16 August, Beatles manager [[Brian Epstein]] fired their drummer, [[Pete Best]], who recalled: "He said 'I've got some bad news for you.

Starr's first recording session as a member of the Beatles took place on 4 September 1962.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|p=59}} He stated that Martin had thought that he "was crazy and couldn't play&nbsp;... because I was trying to play the percussion and the drums at the same time, we were just a four piece band".{{sfn|Everett|2001|p=126}} For their second recording session with Starr, which took place on 11 September 1962, Martin replaced him with session drummer [[Andy White (drummer)|Andy White]] while recording takes for what would be the [[A-side and B-side|two sides]] of the Beatles' first single, "[[Love Me Do]]" backed with "[[P.S. I Love You (Beatles song)|P.S. I Love You]]".{{sfn|Harry|2004|pp=367<U+2013>368}} Starr played tambourine on "Love Me Do" and maracas on "P.S.

By November 1962 Starr had been accepted by Beatles fans, who were now calling for him to sing songs.{{sfn|Clayson|2005|pp=89, 147}} Soon afterwards, he began receiving an amount of fanmail equal to that of the others, which helped to secure his position within the band.{{sfn|Clayson|2005|p=105}} Starr considered himself fortunate to be on the same "wavelength" as the other Beatles: "I had to be, or I wouldn't have lasted. I had to join them as people [sic] as well as a drummer."{{sfn|Clayson|2005|p=94}} He was given a small percentage of Lennon and McCartney's publishing company, [[Northern Songs]], but he derived his primary income during this period from a one-quarter share of Beatles Ltd, a corporation financed by the band's net concert earnings.{{sfn|Clayson|2005|p=105}} He commented on the nature of his lifestyle after having achieved success with the Beatles: "I lived in nightclubs for three years. It used to be a non-stop party."{{sfn|Clayson|2005|p=112}} Like his father Starr became well known for his late-night dancing and he received considerable praise for his skills.{{sfn|Clayson|2005|p=112}}

During 1963, the Beatles enjoyed increasing popularity in England. In January, their second single, "[[Please Please Me (song)|Please Please Me]]" followed "Love Me Do" into the UK charts and a successful television appearance on ''[[Thank Your Lucky Stars (TV series)|Thank Your Lucky Stars]]'' earned them favourable reviews, leading to a boost in sales and radio play.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|p=88}} By the end of the year, the phenomenon known as [[Beatlemania]] had spread throughout the country, and by February 1964 the Beatles had become an international success, performing on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' to a record 73 million viewers.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|pp=93, 136<U+2013>137}} Starr commented: "In the states I know I went over well.

(film)|Help!]]'' (1965), Starr won a ''Melody Maker'' poll against his fellow Beatles for his performance as the central character in the film.{{sfn|Clayson|2005|p=148}}

During an interview with ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine in 1964, Lennon explained that Starr had filled-in with the Beatles when Best was ill; Starr replied: "[Best] took little pills to make him ill".{{sfn|Clayson|2005|p=128}} Soon after Starr made the comment, a provoked Best filed a [[libel]] suit against him that lasted for four years before the court reached an undisclosed settlement in Best's favour.{{sfn|Clayson|2005|pp=127<U+2013>128}} In June, the Beatles were scheduled to tour Denmark, the Netherlands, Asia, Australia and New Zealand, but Starr became ill the day before the start of the tour.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|pp=160<U+2013>161}} Stricken with a high-grade fever, [[pharyngitis]] and [[tonsillitis]], he was admitted to a local hospital where he briefly stayed followed by several days of recuperation at home.{{sfn|Clayson|2005|pp=128<U+2013>130}} During this time, Starr was temporarily replaced for five concert dates by 24-year-old session drummer [[Jimmie Nicol]].{{sfn|Babiuk|2002|p=132}} Starr was discharged from the hospital, and he rejoined the band in Melbourne on 15 June.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|pp=160<U+2013>163}}{{refn|group=nb|Epstein then accompanied Nicol to the Melbourne airport where he gave him a cheque and a gold Eterna-matic wrist watch inscribed: "From the Beatles and Brian Epstein to Jimmy&nbsp;<U+2013> with appreciation and gratitude."{{sfn|Harry|2004|p=255}} Starr had his tonsils removed later that year during a Christmas holiday.{{sfn|Harry|2004|p=111}}}} He later admitted that he feared he would be permanently replaced during his illness.<ref>{{cite web|last=Rhythm|first=Johnny|title=The Beatles' Many Drummers|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/lifestyle/blogcritics/article/The-Beatles-Many-Drummers-3776938.php|work=Seattle Post-Intelligencer|accessdate=2 January 2013}}</ref> In August, when the Beatles were introduced to [[Bob Dylan]], Starr was the first to try a cannabis cigarette offered to the band by Dylan, whereas Lennon, McCartney and Harrison were hesitant.<ref>{{harvnb|Gould|2007|p=252}}: Meeting Dylan in August; {{harvnb|Clayson|2005|p=137}} Starr was the first Beatle to smoke cannabis.</ref>

On 11 February 1965, Starr married [[Maureen Starkey Tigrett|Maureen Cox]], whom he had first met in 1962.{{sfn|Harry|2004|pp=333<U+2013>334}} By this time the negative aspects of Beatlemania had reached a peak for him, who after having received a telephoned death threat before a show in Montreal resorted to positioning his cymbals vertically in an attempt to provide protection from would-be assassins. The constant pressure of the Beatles' fame impacted their live performances; Starr commented: "We were turning into such bad musicians&nbsp;... there was no groove to it."{{sfn|Clayson|2005|pp=139<U+2013>140}} He was also feeling increasingly isolated from the musical activities of his bandmates, who were moving past the traditional boundaries of rock music into territory that often did not require his accompaniment; during recording sessions he spent countless hours playing cards with their road manager [[Neil Aspinall]] and roadie [[Mal Evans]] while the other Beatles perfected tracks without him.{{sfn|Clayson|2005|p=147}} In a letter published in ''Melody Maker'', a fan asked the Beatles to let Starr sing more; he replied: "[I am] quite happy with my one little track on each album".{{sfn|Clayson|2005|p=147}}

In August 1966, the Beatles released ''[[Revolver (Beatles album)|Revolver]]'', their seventh UK LP.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|p=350}} The album included the song "[[Yellow Submarine (song)|Yellow Submarine]]", which was the only British number one single with Starr as the lead singer.{{sfn|Clayson|2005|p=159}} Later that month and owing to the increasing pressures of touring, the Beatles gave their final concert, a 30-minute performance at San Francisco{{'s}} [[Candlestick Park]].<ref>{{harvnb|Clayson|2005|p=152}}; {{harvnb|Lewisohn|1992|pp=210, 230}}.</ref> Starr commented: "We gave up touring at the right time. Four years of Beatlemania were enough for anyone."{{sfn|Clayson|2005|p=152}} By December, he had moved into an upscale estate on three acres in [[Saint George's Hill]] called [[Sunny Heights]].{{sfn|Clayson|2005|pp=142<U+2013>144}} Although he had adorned the house with many of the finest luxuries available at the time, including numerous televisions, light machines, film projectors and stereo equipment, a [[billiard table]], [[go-kart]] track and a bar named the Flying Cow, he did not include a drum kit, he explained: "When we don't record, I don't play".{{sfn|Clayson|2005|pp=143<U+2013>144}}

For the Beatles' seminal 1967 album, ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'', Starr sang lead vocals on the [[Lennon<U+2013>McCartney]] composition "[[With a Little Help from My Friends]]".{{sfn|Clayson|2005|pp=159<U+2013>161, 179}} Although the Beatles had enjoyed widespread commercial and critical success with ''Sgt. Pepper'', the long hours they spent recording the LP contributed to Starr's increased feeling of alienation within the band, he commented: "[It] wasn't our best album. That was the peak for everyone else, but for me it was a bit like being a session musician&nbsp;... They more or less direct me in the style I can play."{{sfn|Clayson|2005|pp=160<U+2013>161}}{{refn|group=nb|Starr offered no suggestions for inclusion on the album's historic front cover.{{sfn|Clayson|2005|p=160}}}} His inability to compose new material led to his input being minimised during recording sessions; he often found himself relegated to adding minor percussion effects to songs by McCartney, Lennon and Harrison.{{sfn|Clayson|2005|pp=161<U+2013>162}} During his down-time Starr worked on his guitar playing; he commented: "I jump into chords that no one seems to get into. Most of the stuff I write is twelve-bar".{{sfn|Clayson|2005|p=161}}

Epstein's death in August 1967 left the Beatles without management; Starr remarked: "[It was] a strange time for us, when it's someone who've relied on in the business, where we never got involved."{{sfn|Clayson|2005|p=166}} Soon afterwards, the band began an ill-fated film project, ''[[Magical Mystery Tour (film)|Magical Mystery Tour]]''. Starr's growing interest in photography at the time lead to his billing as the movie's Director of Photography, and his participation in the film's editing was matched only by McCartney.{{sfn|Clayson|2005|pp=166<U+2013>168}}

In February 1968, Starr became the first Beatle to sing during another artist's show without the other three present. He sang the [[Buck Owens]] hit "[[Act Naturally]]", and performed a duet with [[Cilla Black]], "Do you Like Me Just a Little Bit?" on her [[BBC One]] television programme, ''Cilla''.{{sfn|Clayson|2005|pp=175<U+2013>176}} Later that year [[Apple Records]] released ''[[The Beatles (album)|The Beatles]]'', commonly known as the ''White Album''.{{sfn|Gould|2007|p=510}} Creative inspiration for the double-LP came in part from the band's recent interactions with the [[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]].{{sfn|Harry|2000|pp=705<U+2013>706}} While attending an intermediate course at his [[ashram]] in [[Rishikesh]], India, they enjoyed one of [[The Beatles in India|their most prolific writing periods]], composing most of the album's songs there.{{sfn|Harry|2000|pp=108<U+2013>109}} Despite leaving after ten days, Starr completed his first recorded Beatles song, "[[Don't Pass Me By]]", while in India.<ref>{{harvnb|Everett|2001|pp=206<U+2013>207: "Don't Pass Me By"}}; {{harvnb|Harry|2004|p=187: "Don't Pass Me By"}}.</ref>{{refn|group=nb|Starr compared his stay in India with a Butlins camp.{{sfn|Gould|2007|pp=463<U+2013>468}} His childhood health problems had an enduring effect in the form of allergies and sensitivities to food, and when the Beatles travelled to India he took his own food with him.<ref>{{harvnb|Clayson|2005|p=171}}: (secondary source); {{harvnb|The Beatles|2000|p=284}}: (primary source).</ref>}} During the recording of the ''White Album'', relations within the band became openly divisive.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|pp=283<U+2013>304}} As the sessions progressed, their collective group dynamic began to decay; at times only one or two Beatles were involved in the recording for a track.{{sfn|Clayson|2005|pp=182<U+2013>184}} Starr had grown weary of McCartney's increasingly overbearing approach and Lennon's [[passive-aggressive behaviour]], which was exacerbated by Starr's resentment of [[Yoko Ono]]{{'s}} near constant presence.{{sfn|Clayson|2005|pp=182<U+2013>184}} After one particularly difficult session during which McCartney had harshly criticised his drumming, he quit the band for two weeks, taking a holiday with his family in [[Sardinia]] on a boat loaned by [[Peter Sellers]].<ref>{{harvnb|Clayson|2005|pp=183<U+2013>184}}; {{harvnb|Harry|2004|pp=259<U+2013>260}}.</ref> During a lunch break the chef served octopus, which Starr refused to eat.

Despite a temporary return to congenial relations during the completion of the ''White Album'', production of the Beatles' fourth feature film, ''[[Let It Be (film)|Let It Be]]'', and its [[Let It Be|accompanying LP]], strained an already tenuous cohesion within the band.{{sfn|Clayson|2005|pp=189<U+2013>192}} On 20 August 1969, the Beatles gathered for the final time at [[Abbey Road Studios]] for a mixing session for "[[I Want You (She's So Heavy)]]".{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|p=331}} Following a business meeting on 20 September 1969, Lennon told the others that [[Break-up of the Beatles|he had quit the Beatles]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Norman|first=Philip|year=2008|title=John Lennon: The Life|publisher=Ecco/HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-06-075401-3|pages=622<U+2013>624}}</ref>

Starr guested on two songs from McCartney's 1997 album, ''[[Flaming Pie]]''. McCartney had written a song about Starr's ex-wife Maureen, who died in 1994, called "Little Willow" and asked Starr if he would play on another song, "Beautiful Night".{{sfn|Harry|2004|p=236: ''Little Willow"; 83<U+2013>84: "Beautiful Night"}} The day after the "Beautiful Night" session, the two recorded a jam session, which developed into another song, "Really Love You", notable for being the first official release ever credited to McCartney/Starkey.{{sfn|Harry|2004|p=275}} In 1998, he released two albums on the [[Mercury Records|Mercury]] label. The studio album ''[[Vertical Man]]'' marked the beginning of a nine-year partnership with [[Mark Hudson (musician)|Mark Hudson]], who produced the album and, with his band the Roundheads, formed the core of the backing group for the album. In addition, many famous guests joined on various tracks, including Martin, McCartney and, in his final appearance on a Starr album, Harrison. Most of the songs were written by Starr and the band. Joe Walsh and the Roundheads joined Starr for his appearance on ''[[VH1 Storytellers (Ringo Starr album)|VH1 Storytellers]]'', which was released as an album under the same name. During the show, he performed greatest hits and new songs and told anecdotes relating to them.{{sfn|Harry|2004|p=358}}

Starr released ''[[Liverpool 8]]'' in 2008, an album produced by [[David A. Stewart|Dave Stewart]], Mark Hudson and Starr. Hudson was the initial producer of the recordings but was replaced by Stewart after a falling out with Starr.

== Musicianship ==

=== Influences ===
During his youth, Starr had been a devoted fan of skiffle and [[blues]] music, but by the time he joined the Texans in 1958, he had developed a preference for rock and roll.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|pp=343<U+2013>344}} He was also influenced by [[country music|country]] artists, including [[Hank Williams]], Buck Owens and [[Hank Snow]], and [[jazz]] drummers such as [[Chico Hamilton]] and [[Yusef Lateef]], whose compositional style inspired Starr's fluid and energetic drum fills and [[Groove (music)|grooves]].<ref>{{harvnb|The Beatles|2000|p=36}}: influenced by country artists (primary source); {{harvnb|Clayson|2005|p=20}}: influenced by country artists (secondary source); {{harvnb|Everett|2001|p=119}}: influenced by country artists (secondary source); {{harvnb|Spitz|2005|pp=343<U+2013>344}}: influenced by jazz drummers [[Chico Hamilton]] and [[Yusef Lateef]].</ref> While reflecting on Buddy Rich, Starr commented: "He does things with one hand that I can't do with nine, but that's technique. Everyone I talk to says 'What about Buddy Rich?' Well, what about him? Because he doesn't turn me on."{{sfn|Clayson|2005|p=42}} He stated that he "was never really into drummers", but identified [[Cozy Cole]]{{'s}} 1958 [[Cover version|cover]] of [[Benny Goodman]]{{'s}} "[[Topsy (song)|Topsy Part Two]]" as "the one drum record" he bought.<ref>{{harvnb|The Beatles|2000|p=36}}: (primary source); {{harvnb|Clayson|2005|p=40}}: (secondary source).</ref>

Starr's first musical hero was [[Gene Autry]], about whom he commented: "I remember getting shivers up my back when he sang, "[[South of the Border (1939 song)|South of the Border]]".{{sfn|Clayson|2005|p=20}} By the early 1960s he had become an ardent fan of [[Lee Dorsey]].{{sfn|Clayson|2005|p=76}} In November 1964, Starr told ''[[Melody Maker]]'': "Our music is second-hand versions of negro music&nbsp;... Ninety per cent of the music I like is coloured."{{sfn|Clayson|2005|p=113}}

=== Drumming ===
[[File:20110626 043 All-Starr-Band-in-Paris Ringo-Starr drums WP.jpg|thumb|250px|alt=A colour photograph of Starr playing a dark coloured drum kit on a stage. The background is yellow.|right|Starr with his All-Starr Band in Paris, 26 June 2011]]

While Starr has acknowledged the technical limitations of his drumming for the Beatles, the overall effect of his contribution has received high praise from notable drummers. Starr commented: "I'm no good on the technical things&nbsp;... I'm your basic offbeat drummer with funny fills&nbsp;... because I'm really left-handed playing a right-handed kit. I can't roll around the drums because of that."{{sfn|Harry|2004|p=44}} Beatles producer George Martin stated: "Ringo hit good and hard and used the tom-tom well, even though he couldn't do a roll to save his life", although Martin later added, "He's got tremendous feel. He always helped us to hit the right tempo for a song, and gave it that support&nbsp;<U+2013> that rock-solid back-beat&nbsp;<U+2013> that made the recording of all the Beatles' songs that much easier."{{sfn|Harry|2004|p=44}} Starr commented: "I've always believed that the drummer is not there to interpret the song", comparing his drumming to painting, he stated: "I am the foundation, and then I put a bit of glow here and there&nbsp;... If there's a gap, I want to be good enough to fill it."{{sfn|Clayson|2005|p=42}}

In 2011, readers of ''Rolling Stone'' magazine voted Starr as the fifth-greatest drummer of all time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/pictures/rolling-stone-readers-pick-best-drummers-of-all-time-20110208/5-ringo-starr-0875383|title=Rolling Stone Readers Pick Best Drummers of All Time|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|accessdate=30 December 2012}}</ref> Journalist Robyn Flans, a long-time contributor with ''Modern Drummer'' magazine, writing for the Percussive Arts Society stated: "I cannot count the number of drummers who have told me that Ringo inspired their passion for drums".<ref name="PAS"/> Drummer [[Steve Smith (musician)|Steve Smith]] commented on Starr's musical contribution:

{{quote|Before Ringo, drum stars were measured by their soloing ability and virtuosity. Ringo's popularity brought forth a new paradigm in how the public saw drummers. We started to see the drummer as an equal participant in the compositional aspect. One of Ringo's great qualities was that he composed unique, stylistic drum parts for the Beatles' songs. His parts are so signature to the songs that you can listen to a Ringo drum part without the rest of the music and still identify the song.<ref name="PAS">{{cite web|url=http://www.pas.org/experience/halloffame/StarrRingo.aspx|last=Flans|first=Robyn|title=Ringo Starr|work=PAS Hall of Fame|publisher=Percussive Arts Society|accessdate=2 January 2013}}</ref>}}

So Ringo's talent would have come out one way or the other&nbsp;... whatever that spark is in Ringo, we all know it but can't put our finger on it.

In his extensive survey of the Beatles' recording sessions, historian [[Mark Lewisohn]] confirmed that Starr was both proficient and remarkably reliable and consistent. According to Lewisohn, there were fewer than a dozen occasions in the Beatles' eight-year recording career where session breakdowns were caused by Starr making a mistake, while the vast majority of takes were stopped owing to mistakes by the other three Beatles.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1988|p=95}} Starr is considered to have influenced various modern drumming techniques, such as the [[matched grip]], tuning the drums lower, and using muffling devices on tonal rings, as well as placing the drums on high risers for visibility as part of the band.<ref name="PAS"/> According to Ken Micallef and Donnie Marshall, co-authors of ''Classic Rock Drummers'': "Ringo's fat tom sounds and delicate cymbal work were imitated by thousands of drummers."<ref>{{cite book|last1=Micallef|first1=Ken|last2=Marshall|first2=Donnie|title=Classic Rock Drummers|publisher=Backbeat Books|year=2007|isbn=978-0-87930-907-7|url= http://books.google.com/books?id=qLAKB07xk94C&dq|page=95}}</ref>

=== Singing ===
Starr sang lead vocals for a song on most of the Beatles' studio albums as part of an attempt to establish a vocal personality for each band member. In many cases, Lennon or McCartney wrote the lyrics and melody especially for him, as they did for "Yellow Submarine" from ''Revolver'' and "With a Little Help from My Friends" on ''Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band''.<ref name="harddayswritelittlehelp">{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Steve|title=A Hard Day's Write: The Stories Behind Every Beatles Song|editor=Nicola Hodge|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|year=1999|edition=9|page=122|chapter=Sgt Pepper's Lonely hearts Club Band|isbn=0-06-273698-1}}</ref> These melodies were tailored to Starr's limited [[baritone]] vocal range.

=== Composition ===
Starr's idiosyncratic turns of phrase, or ''Ringoisms'' as they became known, such as ''[[A Hard Day's Night (song)#Title|a hard day's night]]'' and ''[[Tomorrow Never Knows|tomorrow never knows]]'', were used as song titles by the Beatles, particularly by Lennon.{{sfn|Harry|2004|p=3}} McCartney commented: "Ringo would do these little [[malapropism]]s, he would say things slightly wrong, like people do, but his were always wonderful, very lyrical&nbsp;... they were sort of magic".{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=164}} As well as inspiring his bandmates' creativity in this way, Starr occasionally contributed lyrics to unfinished Lennon<U+2013>McCartney songs, such as the line "''darning his socks in the night when there's nobody there''" from "[[Eleanor Rigby]]".<ref name="harddayswriteeleanorrigby">{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Steve|title=A Hard Day's Write: The Stories Behind Every Beatles Song|editor=Nicola Hodge|publisher=HarperCollins|year=1999|edition=9|page=105|chapter=Revolver|isbn=0-06-273698-1}}</ref>
