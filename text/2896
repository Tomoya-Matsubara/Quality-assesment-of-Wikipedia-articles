'''Vanuatu''' ({{Audio-IPA|en-us-Vanuatu.ogg|/<U+02CC>v<U+0251><U+02D0>nu<U+02D0><U+02C8><U+0251><U+02D0>tu<U+02D0>/}} {{respell|vah-n'''oo'''|AH|t'''oo'''}} or {{IPA-en|<U+02CC>v<U+00E6>n<U+02C8>w<U+0251><U+02D0>tu<U+02D0>|}} {{respell|van|WAH|t'''oo'''}}), officially the '''Republic of Vanuatu''' ([[French language|French]]: ''R<U+00E9>publique de Vanuatu'', [[Bislama]]: ''Ripablik blong Vanuatu''), is an [[island nation]] located in the South [[Pacific Ocean]].  The [[archipelago]], which is of volcanic origin, is some {{convert|1750|km|mi}} east of northern [[Australia]], {{convert|500|km|mi}} northeast of [[New Caledonia]], west of [[Fiji]], and southeast of the [[Solomon Islands]], near [[New Guinea]].

Vanuatu was first inhabited by [[Melanesia]]n people. [[Europe]]ans began to settle in the area in the late 18th century. In the 1880s [[France]] and the [[United Kingdom]] claimed parts of the country, and in 1906 they agreed on a framework for jointly managing the archipelago as the [[New Hebrides]] through a British-French [[Condominium (international law)|Condominium]].  An independence movement arose in the 1970s, and the Republic of Vanuatu was created in 1980.

==History==
{{Main|History of Vanuatu}}

The prehistory of Vanuatu is obscure; archaeological evidence supports the commonly held theory that peoples speaking [[Austronesian languages]] first came to the islands some 4,000 years ago. Pottery fragments have been found dating back to 1300<U+2013>1100 B.C.E.<ref name=cp>[http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2815.htm "Background Note: Vanuatu"]. [[U.S. Department of State]] (April 2008). ''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]].</ref>

The first island in the Vanuatu group discovered by Europeans was ''[[Espiritu Santo]]'', when in 1606 the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] explorer [[Pedro Fernandes de Queir<U+00F3>s]] working for the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish crown]], spied what he thought was a southern continent.  Europeans did not return until 1768, when [[Louis Antoine de Bougainville]] rediscovered the islands.  In 1774, [[Captain Cook]] named the islands the [[New Hebrides]], a name that lasted until independence.<ref name=cp/>

In 1825, trader [[Peter Dillon]]'s discovery of [[sandalwood]] on the island of [[Erromango]] began a rush of immigrants that ended in 1830 after a clash between immigrant Polynesian workers and indigenous Melanesians.  During the 1860s, planters in Australia, Fiji, New Caledonia, and the Samoa Islands, in need of laborers, encouraged a long-term indentured labor trade called "[[blackbirding]]".  At the height of the labor trade, more than one-half the adult male population of several of the Islands worked abroad.  Fragmentary evidence indicates that the current population of Vanuatu is greatly reduced compared to pre-contact times.<ref name=cp/>

It was in the 19th century that both Catholic and Protestant [[missionaries]] arrived on the islands.  Settlers also came, looking for land on which to establish cotton plantations.  When international cotton prices collapsed, planters switched to coffee, cocoa, bananas, and, most successfully, coconuts.  Initially, British subjects from [[Australia]] made up the majority, but the establishment of the Caledonian Company of the New Hebrides in 1882 soon tipped the balance in favor of French subjects. By the turn of the century, the French outnumbered the British two to one.<ref name=cp/>

The jumbling of French and British interests in the islands brought petitions for one or another of the two powers to annex the territory. In 1906, however, France and the United Kingdom agreed to administer the islands jointly. Called the British-French [[Condominium (international law)|Condominium]], it was a unique form of government, with separate governmental systems that came together only in a joint court. Melanesians were barred from acquiring the citizenship of either power.<ref name=cp/>

Challenges to this form of government began in the early 1940s. The arrival of [[United States|Americans]] during [[World War II]], with their informal demeanor and relative wealth, was instrumental in the rise of nationalism in the islands. The belief in a mythical messianic figure named [[John Frum]] was the basis for an indigenous [[cargo cult]] (a movement attempting to obtain industrial goods through magic) promising Melanesian deliverance. Today, John Frum is both a religion and a political party with a member in Parliament.<ref name=cp/>

The first political party was established in the early 1970s and originally was called the New Hebrides National Party. One of the founders was Father [[Walter Lini]], who later became Prime Minister. Renamed the [[Vanua'aku Pati]] in 1974, the party pushed for independence; in 1980, amidst the brief [[Coconut War]],<ref name=twsSEPbvf>{{cite book

During the 1990s Vanuatu experienced political instability which eventually resulted in a more decentralized government. The Vanuatu Mobile Force, a paramilitary group, attempted a coup in 1996 because of a pay dispute. There were allegations of corruption in the government of [[Maxime Carlot Korman]]. New elections have been called for several times since 1997, most recently in 2004.

==Flora and fauna==

Despite its tropical forests, Vanuatu has a limited number of plant and animal species. There are no indigenous large mammals. The 19 species of native reptiles include the [[Ramphotyphlops braminus|flowerpot snake]], found only on Efate. There are 11 species of bats (3 unique to Vanuatu) and 61 species of land and water birds. While the small Polynesian rat is thought to be indigenous, the large species arrived with Europeans, as did domesticated hogs, dogs, and cattle. The ant species of some of the islands of Vanuatu were cataloged by [[E. O. Wilson]].<ref>* E. O. Wilson, ''[[Naturalist (book)|Naturalist]]'', 1994, Shearwater Books, ISBN 1-55963-288-7</ref>

The region is rich in sea life, with more than 4,000 species of marine mollusks. Coneshell and stonefish carry poison fatal to humans.

The giant East African land snail arrived only in the 1970s but already has spread from the Port-Vila region to Luganville.

There are 3 or possibly 4 adult [[saltwater crocodile]]s living in Vanuatu's mangroves and no current breeding population. It is unknown whether crocodiles ever had a natural breeding population (the crocodiles there today descend from ones brought to the island by colonists){{fact}} but it is certainly possible given the island chain's proximity to the Solomon Islands and New Guinea (where crocodiles are very common.)

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of Vanuatu}}
[[File:Vanuatu Tanna Yasur.JPG|thumb|Cinder plain of [[Mount Yasur]] on [[Tanna (island)|Tanna]] island]]
Vanuatu is an island archipelago consisting of approximately 82 relatively small, geologically newer islands of volcanic origin (65 of them inhabited), with about {{convert|800|mi|km}} north to south distance between the outermost islands.<ref name=pc/> Two of these islands ([[Matthew and Hunter Islands|Matthew and Hunter]]) are also claimed by the French overseas department of [[New Caledonia]]. Fourteen of Vanuatu's islands have surface areas of more than {{convert|100|km2|sqmi}}. From largest to smallest, these are [[Espiritu Santo]], [[Malakula]], [[Efate]], [[Erromango]], [[Ambrym]], [[Tanna (island)|Tanna]], [[Pentecost Island|Pentecost]], [[Epi (island)|Epi]], [[Ambae]] or Aoba, [[Vanua Lava]], [[Gaua]], [[Maewo]], [[Malo Island|Malo]], and [[Anatom]] or Aneityum.

Vanuatu<U+2019>s relatively fast growing population (estimated in 2008 at 2.4 percent annually)<ref>Asia Development Bank Vanuatu Economic Report 2009</ref> is placing increased pressure on local resources for agriculture, grazing, hunting, and fishing.<ref name=pc/>  Some 90 percent of Ni-Vanuatu households fish and consume fish, which has caused intense fishing pressure near villages and the depletion of near-shore fish species.<ref name=pc/> While well vegetated, most islands also show signs of deforestation.<ref name=pc/> They have been logged (particularly of higher-value timber), subjected
to wide-scale slash-and-burn agriculture, converted to coconut plantations and cattle ranches, and show evidence of increased soil erosion and landslides.<ref name=pc/> Freshwater is becoming increasingly scarce and many upland watersheds are being deforested and degraded.<ref name=pc/> Proper waste disposal and water and air pollution are also increasingly troublesome issues around urban areas and large villages.<ref name=pc/> Additionally, the lack of employment opportunities in industry and urban areas and inaccessibility to markets have combined to lock rural families into a subsistence or self-reliance mode, putting tremendous pressure on local ecosystems.<ref name=pc/>

==Administrative divisions==
{{Main|Provinces of Vanuatu}}
[[File:Vanuatu Provinces.JPG|thumb|300px|Provinces of Vanuatu]]
Vanuatu has been divided into six [[province]]s since 1994. The names in English of all provinces are derived from the initial letters of their constituent islands:

*[[Malampa Province|Malampa]] (Malakula, Ambrym, Paama)
*[[Penama Province|Penama]] (Pentecost, Ambae, Maewo <U+2013> in French: P<U+00E9>nama)
*[[Sanma Province|Sanma]] (Santo, Malo)
*[[Shefa Province|Shefa]] (Shepherds group, Efate <U+2013> in French: Sh<U+00E9>fa)
*[[Tafea Province|Tafea]] (Tanna, Aniwa, Futuna, Erromango, Aneityum <U+2013> in French: Taf<U+00E9>a)
*[[Torba Province|Torba]] (Torres islands, Banks islands)

Provinces are autonomous units with their own popularly elected local parliaments known officially as provincial councils. They collect local taxes and make by-laws in local matters like tourism, the provincial budget or the provision of some basic services.  They are headed by a chairman elected from among the members of the local parliaments and assisted by a secretary appointed by the [[Public Service Commission]]. Their executive arm consists of a provincial government headed by an executive officer who is appointed by the [[Prime Minister]] with the advice of the minister of local government. The provincial government is usually formed by the party that has the majority in the provincial council and, like the national government, is advised in Ni-Vanuatu culture and language by the local council of chiefs. The provincial president is constitutionally a member of the electoral college that elects the [[President of Vanuatu]].

The provinces are in turn divided into municipalities (usually consisting of an individual island) headed by a council and a mayor elected from among the members of the council.

==Politics==
{{Main|Politics of Vanuatu}}
[[File:Vanuatu Parliament.jpg|thumb|Parliament of Vanuatu]][[File:VanuatuMapExCIA.jpg|thumb|300px|Map of Vanuatu]]
<!--Please add new information into relevant articles of the series-->
The Republic of Vanuatu is a [[parliamentary democracy]] with a written [[constitution]], which declares that the "head of the Republic shall be known as the President and shall symbolise the unity of the nation." The powers of the [[President of Vanuatu]], who is elected for a 5-year term by a two-thirds majority of an electoral college, are primarily ceremonial.<ref>{{cite web| publisher = Government of the Republic of Vanuatu| year = 1983|url = http://www.vanuatugovernment.gov.vu/government/library/constitution.html|title = Constitution of the Republic of Vanuatu|accessdate = 2009-07-26}}</ref>  The electoral college consists of members of Parliament and the presidents of Regional Councils. The President may be removed by the electoral college for gross misconduct or incapacity. The [[Prime Minister of Vanuatu|Prime Minister]], who is the [[head of government]], is elected by a majority vote of a three-fourths [[quorum]] of the Parliament. The prime minister, in turn, appoints the Council of Ministers, whose number may not exceed a quarter of the number of parliamentary representatives. The prime minister and the Council of Ministers constitute the executive government. 

The [[Parliament of Vanuatu]] is [[unicameral]] and has 54 members, who are elected by popular vote every four years unless earlier dissolved by a majority vote of a three-quarters quorum or by a directive from the President on the advice of the Prime Minister. The national Council of Chiefs, called the ''[[Malvatu Mauri]]'' and elected by district councils of chiefs, advises the government on all matters concerning ni-Vanuatu culture and language. 

Besides national authorities and figures, Vanuatu also has high-placed people at the village level. Chiefs were and are still the leading figures on village level. It has been reported that even politicians need to oblige them.<ref>Lonely Planet:Vanuatu</ref> One becomes such a figure by holding a number of lavish feasts (each feast allowing them a higher ceremonial grade) or alternatively through inheritance (the latter only in Polynesian-influenced villages). In northern Vanuatu, feasts are graded through the [[nimangki]]-system.  

Government and society in Vanuatu tend to divide along linguistic French and English lines. Forming [[coalition government]]s, however, has proved problematic at times due to differences between [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]] speakers.  

The Supreme Court consists of a chief justice and up to three other judges. Two or more members of this court may constitute a Court of Appeal. Magistrate courts handle most routine legal matters. The legal system is based on [[Common law|British common law]] and [[French civil law]]. The constitution also provides for the establishment of village or island courts presided over by chiefs to deal with questions of [[Custom (law)|customary law]].

===Foreign relations and military===
{{Main|Foreign relations of Vanuatu}}
Vanuatu has joined the [[Asian Development Bank]], the [[World Bank]], the [[International Monetary Fund]], the ''[[Agence de Coop<U+00E9>ration Culturelle et Technique]]'', ''la [[Francophonie]]'' and the [[Commonwealth of Nations]].

Since 1980, [[Australia]], the United Kingdom (UK), [[France]], and [[New Zealand]] have provided the bulk of Vanuatu's development aid. Direct aid from the UK to Vanuatu ceased in 2005 following the decision by the UK to no longer focus on the Pacific. However, more recently new donors such as the [[Millennium Challenge Account]] (MCA) and the [[People's Republic of China]] have been providing increased amounts of aid funding. In 2005 the MCA announced that Vanuatu was one of the first 15 countries in the world selected to receive support&mdash;an amount of [[United States dollar|US]]$65&nbsp;million was given for the provision and upgrading of key pieces of public infrastructure.  

Vanuatu retains strong economic and cultural ties to Australia, the [[European Union]] (in particular France and UK) and New Zealand. Australia now provides the bulk of external assistance, including to the police force, which has a paramilitary wing. Vanuatu's military consist of a small, mobile, corps of 300 volunteers, the Vanuatu Mobile Force (VMF), which forms part of the Vanuatu Police Force (VPF). Total military expenditures are not available.

==Economy==
{{Main|Economy of Vanuatu}}
[[File:Port Vila market.jpg|thumb|A market in [[Port Vila]]]]
The four mainstays of the economy are [[agriculture]], [[tourism]], offshore [[financial services]], and [[cattle raising]]. There is substantial [[fishing]] activity although this industry doesn't bring in much foreign exchange. Exports include [[copra]], [[kava]], beef, cocoa, and timber, and imports include machinery and equipment, foodstuffs, and fuels.<ref name="Vanuatu">{{cite web|url= http://www.reference.com/browse/vanuatu|title=Vanuatu|publisher= The Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia (via ask.com)|year=2004|accessdate=2009-07-28}}</ref> In contrast, [[mining]] activity is unsubstantial. While manganese mining halted in 1978, there was an agreement in 2006 to export manganese already mined but not yet exported.<ref name="Vanuatu"/> The country has no known [[petroleum]] deposits. A small light-industry sector caters to the local market. [[Tax]] revenues come mainly from import duties and a 12.5 percent [[Value Added Tax|VAT]] on goods and services. Economic development is hindered by dependence on relatively few commodity exports, vulnerability to [[natural disaster]]s, and long distances between constituent islands and from main markets.

[[Agriculture]] is used primarily for consumption as well as for export. It provides a living for 65% of the population. In particular, production of copra and kava create substantial revenue. Many farmers have been abandoning cultivation of food crops, and use earnings from kava cultivation to buy food.<ref>Lonely Planet:Vanuatu</ref> Kava has also been used in ceremonial exchanges between clans and villages.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spc.int/prism/country/VU/stats|title= Census of Agriculture 2007 Vanuatu (page 33 <U+2013> 5.2)|publisher= Vanuatu National Statistics Office (VNSO)|year=2008|accessdate=2009-07-28}}</ref> Cocoa is also grown for foreign exchange.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spc.int/prism/country/VU/stats|title= Census of Agriculture 2007 Vanuatu (page 49 <U+2013> 7.2)|publisher= Vanuatu National Statistics Office (VNSO)|year=2008|accessdate=2009-07-28}}</ref> In 2007, the number of households engaged in fishing was 15,758, mainly for consumption (99%), and the average number of weekly fishing trips was 3.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spc.int/prism/country/VU/stats|title= Census of Agriculture 2007 Vanuatu (page 77 <U+2013> 13.1)|publisher= Vanuatu National Statistics Office (VNSO)|year=2008|accessdate=2009-07-28}}</ref> The tropical climate enables growing of a wide range of fruits and vegetables and spices, including banana, garlic, cabbage, peanuts, pineapples, sugarcane, taro, yams, watermelons, leaf spices, carrots, radishes, eggplants, vanilla (both green and cured), pepper, cucumber, and many others.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spc.int/prism/country/VU/stats|title= Census of Agriculture 2007 Vanuatu (page 114 <U+2013> table 4.17)|publisher= Vanuatu National Statistics Office (VNSO)|year=2008|accessdate=2009-07-28}}</ref> In 2007, the value (in terms of millions of [[vatu]] <U+2013> the official currency of Vanuatu), for agricultural products, was estimated for different products: kava (341 million vatu), copra (195), cattle (135), crop gardens (93), cocoa (59), forestry (56), fishing (24), coffee (12).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spc.int/prism/country/VU/stats|title= Census of Agriculture 2007 Vanuatu (various pages)|publisher= Vanuatu National Statistics Office (VNSO)|year=2008|accessdate=2009-07-28}}</ref>

[[Tourism]] brings in much-needed foreign exchange. Vanuatu is widely recognized as one of the premier vacation destinations for scuba divers wishing to explore coral reefs of the South Pacific region. Tourism increased 17% from 2007 to 2008 to reach 196,134 arrivals, according to one estimate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adb.org/documents/fact_sheets/van.asp|title=Asian Development Bank & Vanuatu -- Fact Sheet (pdf file)|publisher=Asian Development Bank|date=2008-12-31|accessdate=2009-07-26}}</ref> The 2008 total is a sharp increase from 2000, in which there were only 57,000 visitors (of these, 37,000 were from [[Australia]], 8,000 from [[New Zealand]], 6,000 from [[New Caledonia]], 3,000 from [[Europe]], 1,000 from [[North America]], 1,000 from [[Japan]]. (Note: figures rounded to the nearest thousand).<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Vanuatu Statistics Office|year=2001|url=http://www.vanuatustatistics.gov.vu/About%20VNSO/Data/Social/Tour&Mig.htm|title=Tourism and Migration Statistics -- Visitor Arrivals by Usual Country of Residence (1995-2001)|accessdate=2009-07-26}}</ref> Tourism has been promoted, in part, by Vanuatu being the site of several reality-TV shows. The ninth season of the reality TV series ''[[Survivor (US TV series)|Survivor]]'' was filmed on Vanuatu, entitled ''[[Survivor: Vanuatu]]&mdash;Islands of Fire''. Two years later, Australia's ''[[Celebrity Survivor]]'' was filmed at the same location used by the U.S. version. In mid-2002, the government stepped up efforts to boost tourism.

[[Financial services]] are an important part of the economy. Vanuatu is a [[tax haven]] that until 2008 did not release account information to other governments or law-enforcement agencies. International pressure, mainly from Australia, influenced the Vanuatu government to begin adhering to international norms to improve transparency. In Vanuatu, there is no [[income tax]], [[withholding tax]], [[capital gains tax]], [[inheritance tax]], or exchange control.  Many international ship-management companies choose to flag their ships under the Vanuatu flag, because of the tax benefits and favorable labor laws (Vanuatu is a full member of the [[International Maritime Organization]] and applies its international conventions).  Several file-sharing groups, such as the providers of the [[KaZaA]] network of [[Sharman Networks]] and the developers of [[WinMX]], have chosen to incorporate in Vanuatu to avoid regulation and legal challenges. In response to foreign concerns the government has promised to tighten regulation of its [[offshore financial centre]]. Vanuatu receives [[foreign aid]] mainly from [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]].

[[Cattle raising]] leads to beef production for export. One estimate in 2007 for the total value of cattle heads sold was 135 million vatu; cattle were first introduced into the area from Australia by British planter James Paddon.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spc.int/prism/country/VU/stats|title= Census of Agriculture 2007 Vanuatu (page 67 <U+2013> 11.1)|publisher= Vanuatu National Statistics Office (VNSO)|year=2008|accessdate=2009-07-28}}</ref> On average, each household has 5 pigs and 16 chickens, and while cattle are the "most important livestock", pigs and chickens are important for subsistence agriculture as well as playing a significant role in ceremonies and customs (especially pigs).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spc.int/prism/country/VU/stats|title= Census of Agriculture 2007 Vanuatu (page 73 <U+2013> 12.1)|publisher= Vanuatu National Statistics Office (VNSO)|year=2008|accessdate=2009-07-28}}</ref> There are 30 commercial farms (sole proprietorships (37%), partnerships (23%), corporations (17%), with revenues of 533 million vatu and expenses of 329 million vatu in 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spc.int/prism/country/VU/stats|title= Census of Agriculture 2007 Vanuatu (page 97 <U+2013> 15.1)|publisher= Vanuatu National Statistics Office (VNSO)|year=2008|accessdate=2009-07-28}}</ref>

[[Earthquakes]] can negatively affect economic activity on the island nation. A severe earthquake in November 1999, followed by a [[tsunami]], caused extensive damage to the northern island of [[Pentecost]], leaving thousands homeless. Another powerful earthquake in January 2002 caused extensive damage in the capital, Port Vila, and surrounding areas, and was also followed by a tsunami. Another earthquake of 7.2 struck on 2 August 2007.<ref name="USGS7.2">{{cite web|url=http://earthquake.usgs.gov/eqcenter/recenteqsww/Quakes/us2007fmba.php|title=Magnitude 7.2 - Vanuatu|work=USGS Earthquake Hazards Program|accessdate=2007-08-13}}</ref>

The Vanuatu National Statistics Office (VNSO) released their 2007 agricultural census in 2008. According to the study, agricultural exports make up about three-quarters (73%) of all exports; 80% of the population lives in rural areas where "agriculture is the main source of their livelihood"; and of these households, almost all (99%) engaged in agriculture, fisheries and forestry.<ref name="spc.int">{{cite web|url=http://www.spc.int/prism/country/VU/stats|title= Census of Agriculture 2007 Vanuatu (page 18)|publisher=National Statistics Office - Port Vila, Vanuatu - Vanuatu National Statistics Office (VNSO)|year=2008|accessdate=2009-07-28}}</ref> Total annual household income was 1,803 millions of [[vatu]].

The economy grew about 6% in the early 2000s.<ref name="Asian Development Bank">{{cite web|url=http://www.adb.org/documents/fact_sheets/van.asp|title=Asian Development Bank & Vanuatu -- Fact Sheet -- Operational Challenges (pdf file)|publisher=Asian Development Bank|date=2008-12-31|accessdate=2009-07-26}}</ref>  This is higher than in the 1990s, when [[gross domestic product|GDP]] rose less than 3%, on average. 

One report from the Manila-based [[Asian Development Bank]] about Vanuatu's economy gave mixed reviews. It noted the economy was "expanding", noting that the economy grew at an impressive 5.9% rate from 2003 to 2007, and lauded "positive signals regarding reform initiatives from the government in some areas" but described certain binding constraints such as "poor infrastructure services". Since a private monopoly generates power, "electricity costs are among the highest in the Pacific" among developing countries. The report also cited "weak governance and intrusive interventions by the State" which reduced productivity.<ref name="Asian Development Bank"/>

===Communications===
Mobile phone service in the islands is provided by TVL and [[Digicel]]. A government network is under construction, to provide email, telephone, internet and video conferencing facilities to government offices throughout the country.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailypost.vu/ArticleArchives/tabid/56/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/4845/categoryId/10/eGovernment-Opportunities-and-Threats.aspx |title=e-Government - Opportunities and Threats > Daily Post > Article Archives |publisher=Dailypost.vu |date=2009-09-01 |accessdate=2010-05-22}}</ref>

==Demographics==
{{Main|Demographics of Vanuatu|Languages of Vanuatu}}
[[File:Vanuatu demography.png|thumb|400px|Demographics of Vanuatu, Data of [[FAO]], year 2005 ; Number of inhabitants in thousands.]]
Vanuatu has a population of 221,506.<ref name="State" />  Males outnumber females; in 1999, according to the Vanuatu Statistics Office, there were 95,682 males and 90,996 females.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Vanuatu Statistics Office|year=1999|url=http://www.vanuatustatistics.gov.vu/About%20VNSO/Data/Social/Population.htm|title=Population Statistics -- Vanuatu Population Summary -- Resident Population|accessdate=2009-07-26}}</ref>  Infant mortality has declined precipitously during the last half of the twentieth century, from 123 deaths per 100,000 population in 1967 to only 25 per 100,000 in 1999.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Vanuatu Statistics Office|year=1999|url=http://www.vanuatustatistics.gov.vu/About%20VNSO/Data/Social/Population.htm#Vital%20Statistics,%201967%20-%201999|title=Population Statistics -- Vanuatu Population Summary -- Vital Statistics 1967-1999|accessdate=2009-07-26}}</ref>  The population is predominantly rural, although [[Port Vila]] and [[Luganville]] have populations in the tens of thousands. The inhabitants of Vanuatu, or ''[[Ni-Vanuatu]]'', are in the majority (98.5%) of [[Melanesia]]n descent, with the remainder made up of a mix of Europeans, Asians and other Pacific islanders. Three islands were historically colonized by [[Polynesian outlier|Polynesians]]. About 2,000 Ni-Vanuatu live and work in [[New Caledonia]]. In 2006 the [[New Economics Foundation]] and [[Friends of the Earth]] environmentalist group published the [[Happy Planet Index]] which analysed data on [[subjective life satisfaction|levels of reported happiness]], [[life expectancy]] and [[Ecological Footprint]] and estimated Vanuatu to be the most ecologically efficient country in the world in achieving high well-being.<ref>{{cite news

The national language of the Republic of Vanuatu is [[Bislama]]. The official languages are [[Bislama]], [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]]. The principal languages of education are English and French. 

Bislama is a [[pidgin]] language, and now a [[creole language|creole]] in urban areas, which essentially combines a typically Melanesian grammar with a mostly English vocabulary. It is the only language that can be understood and spoken by the majority of Vanuatu's population as a [[lingua franca|second language]]. In addition 113 indigenous [[languages of Vanuatu|languages]] are still 
actively spoken in Vanuatu.<ref name="tourism" /> The density of languages, per capita, is the highest of any nation in the world with an average of only 2,000 speakers per language. All of these vernacular languages belong to the [[Oceanic languages|Oceanic]] branch of the [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]] family.

[[Christianity]] is the predominant [[religion in Vanuatu]], consisting of several denominations. The [[Presbyterian Church]], adhered to by about one third of the population, is the largest of them. [[Roman Catholic]] and [[Anglican]] are other common denominations, each claiming about 15% of the population. Others are the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]], the [[Church of Christ]], [[Neil Thomas Ministries]] (NTM), as well as many other religious sects and denominations. Because of the modernities that the military in [[World War II]] brought with them when they came to the islands, several [[cargo cults]] developed. Many died out, but the [[John Frum]] cult on [[Tanna (island)|Tanna]] is still large, and has adherents in the parliament. Also on Tanna is the [[Prince Philip Movement]], which reveres the United Kingdom's [[Prince Philip]].<ref>[http://www.royal.gov.uk/output/page913.asp Fifty facts about the Duke of Edinburgh] 25 January 2002</ref> Villagers of the [[Yaohnanen]] tribe believed in an ancient story about the pale-skinned son of a mountain spirit venturing across the seas to look for a powerful woman to marry. Prince Philip, having visited the island with his new wife [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth]], fit the description exactly and is therefore revered and even held as a god around the isle of Tanna.

==Culture==
{{Main|Culture of Vanuatu}}

[[File:Wooden slit drums from Vanuatu, Bernice P. Bishop Museum.JPG|thumb|upright|Wooden [[slit drum]]s from Vanuatu, [[Bernice P. Bishop Museum]]]]
Vanuatu culture retains a strong diversity through local regional variations and through foreign influence.  Vanuatu may be divided into three major cultural regions. In the north, wealth is established by how much one can give away. Pigs, particularly those with rounded [[tusk]]s, are considered a symbol of wealth throughout Vanuatu. In the centre, more traditional Melanesian cultural systems dominate. In the south, a system involving grants of title with associated privileges has developed.<ref name="tourism">{{cite web| publisher = [http://www.vanuatutourism.com/ Vanuatu Tourism Office]| url = http://www.vanuatutourism.com/vanuatu/export/sites/VTO/en/culture/culture.html| title = Culture of Vanuatu| accessdate = 2007-07-16}}</ref> 

Young men undergo various coming-of-age ceremonies and rituals <ref>{{cite web|author=Elisabeth Hurtel |url=http://www.south-images.com/photos-melanesia.htm |title='&#39;Customs dances and ceremonies in Vanuatu, photolibrary South-Images'&#39; |publisher=South-images.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-22}}</ref> to initiate them into manhood, usually including [[circumcision]].

Most villages have a ''[[nakamal]]'' or village clubhouse which serves as a meeting point for men and as a place to drink ''[[kava]]''.  Villages also have male and female-only sections. These sections are situated all over the villages; in ''nakamals'', special spaces are provided for females when they are in their menstruation period.

The traditional [[music of Vanuatu]] is still thriving in the rural areas of Vanuatu. Musical instruments consist mostly of [[idiophone]]s: drums of various shape and size, [[slit gong]]s, as well as [[Rattle (percussion)|rattle]]s, among others. Another musical genre that has become widely popular during the 20th century in all areas of Vanuatu, is known as ''[[string band]]'' music. It combines [[guitar]]s, [[ukulele]], and popular songs. 

More recently the music of Vanuatu, as an industry, grew rapidly in the 1990s and several bands have forged a distinctive ni-Vanuatu identity.  Popular genres of modern commercial music, which are currently being played in town include [[zouk]] music and [[reggaeton]].  Reggaeton, a variation of hip-hop rapped in [[Spanish language]], played alongside its own distinctive beat, is especially played in the local nightclubs of Vanuatu with, mostly, an audience of Westerners and tourists.

There are few prominent ni-Vanuatu authors.  [[Women's rights]] activist [[Grace Mera Molisa]], who died in 2002, achieved international notability as a descriptive poet.

[[Cricket]] is very popular in Vanuatu, with its own [[Vanuatu national cricket team|national team]]. There are 8000 registered cricketers.<ref>[http://blogs.cricinfo.com/btw/archives/2008/06/vanuatu_announc_1.php Vanuatu announce major sponsor - Beyond the Test World at Cricinfo<!-- bot-generated title -->] at blogs.cricinfo.com</ref> There is also some [[rugby union in Vanuatu|rugby union played in Vanuatu]]. Sport varies depending on the gender of those involved.  [[Volleyball]] is considered a 'girls' sport' and males play [[soccer]].

The [[cuisine of Vanuatu]] (''aelan kakae'') incorporates [[fish]], root vegetables such as ''[[taro]]'' and [[Yam (vegetable)|yams]], fruits, and vegetables.<ref name="pc"/> Most island families grow food in their gardens, and food shortages are rare.<ref name=pc/> [[Papayas]], [[pineapples]], [[mangoes]], [[plantains]], and [[sweet potatoes]] are abundant through much of the year.<ref name=pc/> [[Coconut milk]] and [[coconut cream|cream]] are used to flavor many dishes.<ref name=pc/> Most food is cooked using hot stones or through boiling and steaming; very little food is fried.<ref name=pc/>

==Health and education==
Vanuatu has a healthy climate and over 80% of the population lives in rural, isolated villages with access to their own gardens and food supplies. 
These geographically isolated communities have minimal access to basic health and education services. Churches and non-government organizations provide a minimal level of support to many rural villages. Vanuatu government health and education services are hard pressed to deal with the rapid increase of urban and peri-urban populations in informal and squatter settlements around [[Port Vila]] and to a lesser extent in Luganville.<ref name="autogenerated1">Asian Development Bank.Vanuatu economic report 2009: accelerating reform. Mandaluyong City, Philippines: Asian Development Bank, 2009.</ref> Health services in Port Vila and Luganville provide reasonable health care, often supported and enhanced by visiting doctors. 
 
Education is not compulsory, and school enrollments and attendance are among the lowest in the Pacific. A 1999 estimate for the literacy rate of people aged 15-24 years was about 87% and a 2006 estimate for adult literacy was 78% in 2006, although the actual figures are likely to be much lower. The rate of primary school enrollment rose from 74.5% in 1989 to 78.2% in 1999 and then to 93.0% in 2004 but then fell to 85.4% in 2007. The proportion of pupils completing a primary education fell from 90% in 1991 to 72% in 2004.<ref name="autogenerated1"/>  

In [[Port Vila]], and three other centres, are locations of the [[University of the South Pacific]], an educational institution co-owned by twelve Pacific countries. The campus in Port Vila, known as the Emalus Campus, houses the University's law school.

==2009 earthquakes==
[[File:Earthquakes Near Vanuatu, October 9, showing plate boundaries.jpg|thumb|350px|Earthquakes near Vanuatu, October 7-8 2009. The circle sizes indicate [[Moment magnitude scale|magnitude]] and the black line shows the [[plate boundary|plate boundaries]].]]
Several moderate to major [[earthquakes]] affected the vicinity of Vanuatu and also of [[Santa Cruz Islands]] between October 7 and 8 2009. The first earthquake struck at 2203 [[UTC]] on October 7 2009 and measured 7.6 [[Moment magnitude scale|M<sub>w</sub>]]. A [[tsunami warning system|tsunami warning]] was issued for 11 countries throughout the region although this was canceled within two hours after only a minor tsunami formed.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.prh.noaa.gov/hnl/tsunami_msgs/HEBTSUHWX.200910080018|title = Tsunami Advisory |accessdate = 2009-07-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.clickondetroit.com/weather/21232878/detail.html?treets=det&tml=det_natlbreak&ts=T&tmi=det_natlbreak_1_06200110072009|title = New Quakes, Small Tsunami Panic Pacific Islanders |accessdate = 2009-07-10}}</ref>

The Vanuatu earthquakes occurred on (or near) the [[plate boundary|boundary]] of the [[Australia Plate]] and the [[Pacific Plate]], and occurred mostly at a depth of 35 kilometers (22 miles). This boundary region is among the most seismically active areas in the world.<ref>

The initial earthquake was re-designated as a foreshock because it was followed by a shock of 7.8 magnitude 15 minutes later in the same area. Moderate [[aftershock]]s occurred and those with magnitude 6.0 or higher are listed below (there were a dozen ranging from 5.0 to 5.8 within the 12 hours following the initial event). Shocks with magnitude 7.0 or higher are highlighted in light blue and the main shock of 7.8 is highlighted in dark blue.
