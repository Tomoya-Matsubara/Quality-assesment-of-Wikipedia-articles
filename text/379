'''Hurricane Bret''' was the first of five Category&nbsp;4 hurricanes that developed during the [[1999 Atlantic hurricane season]] and the first [[tropical cyclone]] since [[Hurricane Jerry (1989)|Hurricane Jerry in 1989]] to make landfall in Texas at hurricane intensity. Forming from a [[tropical wave]] on August&nbsp;18, Bret slowly organized within weak steering currents in the [[Bay of Campeche]]. By August&nbsp;20, the storm began to track northward and underwent [[Rapid deepening|rapid intensification]] on August&nbsp;21. After this period of strengthening, Bret attained its peak intensity with winds of 145&nbsp;mph (230&nbsp;km/h) and a [[barometric pressure]] of 944&nbsp;mbar (hPa; 27.88&nbsp;inHg). Later that day, the storm weakened to a Category&nbsp;3 hurricane and made [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] on [[Padre Island]], Texas. Shortly thereafter, the storm weakened further, becoming a tropical depression 24&nbsp;hours after moving inland. The remnants of the storm eventually dissipated early on August&nbsp;26 over northern Mexico.

Along the Texas coastline, Bret threatened several cities, prompting 180,000&nbsp;residents to evacuate. Numerous shelters were opened throughout the region and prisons were evacuated. Several days prior to the storm's arrival, the NHC issued [[tropical cyclone warnings and watches|hurricane watches]], and later warnings for areas near the Texas<U+2013>Mexico border. Several major roads leading to barrier island towns were shut down to prevent residents from crossing bridges during the hurricane. In nearby Mexico, roughly 7,000&nbsp;people left coastal areas in advance of the storm. Officials also set up hundreds of shelters in northern regions of the country in case of major flooding.

Bret made landfall in a sparsely populated region, resulting in relatively little damage in comparison to its intensity. Nevertheless, seven people were killed in relation to storm, four in Texas and three in Mexico. Most of the deaths were due to car accidents caused by slippery roads. Upon making landfall, the hurricane produced a maximum [[storm surge]] of {{convert|8.8|ft|m|abbr=on}} at [[Matagorda Island]], Texas. Heavy rains produced by Bret peaked at {{convert|13.18|in|mm|abbr=on}} in Texas and were estimated over {{convert|14|in|mm|abbr=on}} in Mexico. Numerous homes in the affected regions were damaged or destroyed, leaving roughly 150 people homeless. In all, the storm caused $15&nbsp;million (1999&nbsp;USD; $19.7&nbsp;million 2009&nbsp;USD) in damage.

Hurricane Bret originated from a [[tropical wave]] that moved off the west coast of Africa on August&nbsp;5. The wave tracked generally westward, interacting with an upper-level low on August&nbsp;15 in the western [[Caribbean Sea]], and spawned a [[low pressure area]]. [[Atmospheric convection|Convective activity]] developed around the low, and by August&nbsp;18 the system was over the [[Yucat<U+00E1>n Peninsula]]. Later that day, the disturbance emerged into the [[Bay of Campeche]] and a [[Hurricane Hunter]] [[reconnaissance mission]] into the system revealed that it had matured into a tropical depression around 1:00&nbsp;pm [[Central Daylight Time|CDT]] (1800&nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]), the third of the [[1999 Atlantic hurricane season|1999 season]].<ref name="TCR"/> Initially, moderate [[wind shear]] prevented the depression from strengthening as it moved slowly and erratically in response to weak steering currents over the system.<ref name="TCR"/><ref>{{cite web|author=James Franklin|publisher=National Hurricane Center|date=August 18, 1999|accessdate=August 21, 2009|title=Tropical Depression Three Discussion Two|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/1999/dis/NAL0399.002.html}}</ref> By August&nbsp;19, the wind shear relented, allowing deep [[Atmospheric convection|convection]] to develop over the center; later that day, the [[National Hurricane Center]] (NHC) upgraded the system to a tropical storm, assigning it the name Bret.<ref name="TCR"/><ref>{{cite web|author=Jack Beven|publisher=National Hurricane Center|date=August 19, 1999|accessdate=August 21, 2009|title=Tropical Depression Three Discussion Four|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/1999/dis/NAL0399.004.html}}</ref> A small tropical cyclone, Bret gradually strengthened for several days as it tracked towards the north.

By the evening of August&nbsp;20, Bret was designated a hurricane following reports of 75&nbsp;mph (120&nbsp;km/h) winds during a Hurricane Hunter mission. At around the same time, Bret established a north-northwest track under the influences of a mid-level [[Ridge (meteorology)|ridge]].<ref>{{cite web|author=James Franklin|publisher=National Hurricane Center|date=August 20, 1999|accessdate=August 21, 2009|title=Hurricane Bret Discussion Ten|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/1999/dis/NAL0399.010.html}}</ref> The following day, Bret began to undergo [[Rapid deepening|rapid intensification]],<ref name="TCR"/> as a well-defined [[eye (cyclone)|eye]] developed.<ref>{{cite web|author=Miles B.

Late on August&nbsp;22, Bret turned northwestward in response to a mid-tropospheric ridge over the Gulf of Mexico and a mid-tropospheric circulation over the [[Rio Grande Valley]].<ref name="TCR"/> Several hours before landfall, the hurricane weakened to Category&nbsp;3 intensity and its forward motion slowed.<ref>{{cite web|author=John L.

On August&nbsp;21, when Bret was first expected to approach the Texas coastline, the NHC issued a [[hurricane watch]] for coastal areas between the border of Mexico and [[Baffin Bay, Texas]]. Hours later, the watch was upgraded to a warning as the storm intensified and posed a more direct threat to the area. A tropical storm warning and hurricane watch were subsequently posted from Baffin Bay northward to [[Port Aransas, Texas|Port Aransas]]. The following day, the hurricane warning was extended to include locations through [[Port O'Connor, Texas|Port O'Connor]] and the advisories were extended to [[Freeport, Texas|Freeport]]. As Bret neared landfall, the hurricane watch between Port O'Connor and Freeport was discontinued. The hurricane warning for Port Aransas to Port O'Connor was discontinued hours after Bret made landfall and began to weaken. By late August&nbsp;23, all watches and warnings in relation to the hurricane were discontinued.<ref name="TCR">{{cite web|author=Miles B. Lawrence and Todd B.

By August&nbsp;22, city officials in [[Corpus Christi, Texas]] declared a state of emergency as Bret was considered a significant threat to the region. Tens of thousands of residents were urged to evacuate coastal areas and seek refuge in local shelters or with relatives further inland.<ref name="evacuation"/> An estimated 180,000 people in the state left their residences ahead of the storm.<ref name="Evacs">{{cite web|author=Yang Zhang, Carla S.

Three schools, two universities and a college were closed on August&nbsp;23 and remained closed for several days.<ref name="evacuation"/>

Eleven shelters were opened in the [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]] area, collectively able to accommodate 3,525 people. About 325 prisoners were evacuated from a [[Nueces County, Texas|Nueces County]] jail as the building they were in was deemed unsafe during hurricane conditions. About 1,000 sailors working in the area were evacuated to the ''[[USS Inchon]]'' prior to the storm. Originally, the ship was meant to ride out the storm at sea; however, inadequate repair work inhibited the ship from leaving port. The ship reportedly had enough supplies to maintain the sailors for roughly 45 days. By 12:00&nbsp;pm CDT on August&nbsp;22,  [[Mustang Island]] and [[Padre Island]] were completely evacuated and officials shut down roads leading in and out of the islands to prevent anyone from re-entering them before the area was deemed safe to enter. A strict order against [[price gouging]] was put in place by city officials in Corpus Christi.<ref name="evacuation">{{cite web|author=Staff Writer|publisher=''The Corpus Christi Caller-Times''|date=August 19, 1999|accessdate=June 11, 2009|title=Hurricane Bret Update|url=http://www.caller2.com/bretupdate.html}}</ref>
