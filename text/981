The '''Indian Army during World War I''' sometimes called the [[British Indian Army]] contributed a number of divisions and independent brigades to the European, Mediterranean and the Middle east theatres of war in [[World War I]]. One million Indian troops would serve overseas, of whom 62,000 died and another 67,000 were wounded.  In total 74,187 Indian soldiers died during the war.

The Indian Army had undergone major reforms in 1903, after [[Horatio Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener of Khartoum|Kitchener]] was appointed [[Commander-in-Chief, India]]. He instituted the large&ndash;scale reforms, including merging the three armies of the Presidencies into a unified force and forming higher level formations, ten army divisions.<ref name=su3/>

In World War I the Indian Army fought against the [[German Empire]] in [[German East Africa]] and on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]. At the [[First Battle of Ypres]], [[Khudadad Khan]] became the first Indian to be awarded a [[Victoria Cross]]. Indian divisions were also sent to Egypt, Gallipoli and nearly 700,000 served in Mesopotamia against the [[Ottoman Empire]].<ref> {{citation|url=http://www.mgtrust.org/ind1.htm|title=Participants from the Indian subcontinent in the First World War|publisher=Memorial Gates Trust|accessdate=2009-09-12}}</ref> While some divisions were sent overseas others had to remain in India guarding the [[North West Frontier]] and on internal security and training duties.

==Kitchener's reforms==

[[Image:2nd Indian Cav Div.jpg|thumb|Indian cavalry from the [[Deccan Horse]] during the [[Battle of Bazentin Ridge]] ]]
[[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Herbert Kitchener]] was appointed [[Commander-in-Chief, India]] in 1902 and after five years, his term of office was extended by a further two<U+2014>during which he reformed the Indian Army.<ref name=su3/> The reforms now directed that there would be only one Indian Army, the three armies of the [[Presidencies of India|Presidencies]] being merged into a unified force.<ref name=hea184/> At the same time, the regiments of the [[Princely state]]s were made available to be called upon for [[Imperial Service Troops|Imperial Service]].<ref name=hea184>Heathcote, p.184</ref> The [[British Army]] also continued to supply units for service in India, in addition to those of the Indian Army.  The term [[Army of India]] was instituted to refer to the overall command structure which included both the British and Indian Army units. The new formation for the Army of India was set at nine divisions, each division with one cavalry and three infantry brigades and these nine divisions together with three independent infantry brigades would serve in India.<ref name=p83/> The Indian Army was also responsible for supplying a [[Burma Division|division in Burma]] and a [[Aden Brigade|brigade in Aden]].<ref name=p83/>  

To assist command and control of the new divisions, two [[field army|field armies]] were formed&mdash; the Northern Army and the Southern Army.<ref name=p83/> The Northern Army had five divisions and three brigades and was responsible for the North West Frontier to [[Bengal]] while the Southern Army, which had four divisions in India and two formations outside the subcontinent, was responsible for [[Baluchistan]] to southern India.<ref name=p83>Perry, p.83</ref> The regiments and battalions of the new organization would be numbered in a single sequence and the old titles of the [[Bombay Army|Bombay]], [[Madras Army|Madras]] and the [[Bengal Army|Bengal Armies]] would be discontinued.<ref name=hea184/> The new regiments and battalions, instead of remaining at their home base, could now all be called upon to serve anywhere in the country, and a tour of duty on the North West Frontier would be an established posting.<ref name=hea184/> One change that was not accepted was the formation of all-British or all-Indian brigades and the system of having one British regiment or battalion in each brigade remained.<ref name=hea184/>

==Organization==
[[File:Indian Troops in France.jpg|thumb|left|Indian troops in France]] 
In 1914, the Indian Army was the largest volunteer army in the world<ref name=su3>Sumner, p.3</ref> with a total strength of 240,000 men.<ref name=p85/>  It was regularly called upon to deal with incursions and raids on the North West Frontier and to provide garrison forces for the [[British Empire]] in Egypt, Singapore and China.<ref>Jeffery, p.3</ref>  The army Headquarters was located in [[Delhi]] and the senior officer (Commander-in-Chief, India) was assisted by a [[Chief of the General Staff, India]].  All the senior command and staff positions in the Indian Army alternated between senior officers of the British and Indian Armies.  In 1914, the Commander&ndash;in&ndash;Chief was General Sir [[Beauchamp Duff]] of the Indian Army,<ref>Heathcote, p.197</ref> and the Chief of the General Staff was Lieutenant General Sir [[Percy Lake]] of the British Army.<ref>Davis, p.153</ref>

The Army organisation contained 39 cavalry regiments, 138 infantry battalions (including 20 [[Gurkha]]),<ref name=p85/> a joint cavalry-infantry unit the [[Corps of Guides (British India)|Corps of Guides]], three [[sapper]] regiments and 12 [[mountain artillery]] batteries.<ref name=su3/>  In addition to the regular Indian Army, the armies of the Princely States and regiments of the Auxiliary Force (European volunteers) could also be called upon to assist in an emergency.<ref name=su3/> The Princely States formed the [[Imperial Service Brigade]]s and in 1914, had 22,613 men in 20 cavalry regiments and 14 infantry battalions.<ref name=p86>Perry, p.86</ref> By the end of the war 26,000 men had served overseas on Imperial Service.<ref name="CWrepdirect"/>  The Auxiliary force could field another 40,000 men in 11 regiments of horse and 42 volunteer infantry battalions.<ref name=p85/> Also available were the Frontier Militia and the Military Police which could field 34,000 men between them.<ref name=p85/>

The divisions formed by these reforms consisted of one cavalry and three infantry brigades, the cavalry brigade had one British and two Indian regiments. While the infantry brigades had four infantry battalions, one British and three Indian.<ref>Barua, p.130</ref> Indian Army battalions were smaller than the British battalions, with 13 British and 17 Indian officers and 723 other ranks.<ref name=p85>Perry, p.85</ref> The Indian battalions were often segregated, with companies comprised of different tribes, castes or religions.<ref>{{cite web|title=Indian Army History|accessdate=2009-10-09|publisher=Global Security.org|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/india/army-history.htm}}</ref> Additional troops attached to the headquarters of each division included a cavalry regiment, a [[pioneer (military)|pioneer]] battalion and artillery provided by the British [[Royal Field Artillery]]. Each division had about 13,000 men on strength, somewhat weaker than a British division in part due to the smaller infantry battalions and weaker artillery forces.<ref name=p86/> The Indian Army was also weakened when 500 British officers on home leave, enough to officer 38 Indian battalions, were posted to the new British divisions being formed for [[Kitchener's Army]].<ref>Chappell (2003), p.9</ref>

The normal annual recruitment for the Indian army was 15,000 men, during the course of the war over 800,000 men volunteered for the army and more than 400,000 volunteered for non combatant roles, in total almost 1.3 million men had volunteered for service by 1918.<ref>Pati, p.31</ref> One million Indian troops served overseas during the war, of these 62,000 died and another 67,000 were wounded.<ref>Sumner, p.7</ref>  In total, 74,187 Indian soldiers died in World War I.<ref name="CWrepdirect"/>

==Home service==
{{main|Hindu<U+2013>German Conspiracy}}
Before World War I, the Indian Army was deployed maintaining internal security and defending the North West Frontier against incursions from Afghanistan. These tasks did not end with the declaration of war. The divisions deployed along the frontier were the existing [[1st (Peshawar) Division]], the [[2nd (Rawalpindi) Division]], the [[4th (Quetta) Division]].<ref name=su9/>  The only war-formed division to serve in India was the [[16th Indian Division]] formed in 1916, it was alo stationed on the North West Frontier.<ref name=su9/> All these divisions were still in place and took part in the [[Third Afghan War]] at the end of World War I.<ref name=su9/>

In supporting the war effort, India was left vulnerable to hostile action from Afghanistan. When a [[Niedermayer-Hentig Expedition|Turco-German mission]] arrived in [[Kabul]] in October 1915, with obvious strategic purpose. [[Habibullah Khan]] abided by his treaty obligations and maintained Afghanistan's neutrality, in the face of internal opposition from factions keen to side with the [[Ottoman Sultan]].<ref>''The Third Afghan War 1919 Official Account'', p.11</ref> Despite this, localised actions along the frontier still took place and included [[Operations in the Tochi]] (1914&ndash;15), [[Operations against the Mohmands, Bunerwals and Swatis]] (1915), [[Kalat Operations]] (1915&ndash;16), [[Mohmand Blockade]] (1916&ndash;17), [[Mehsud|Operations against the Mahsuds]] (1917) and [[Khetran#Struggle against British|Operations against the Marri and Khetran tribes]] (1918).<ref> Riddick, pp.96&ndash;100</ref>

On the North East Frontier between India and Burma punitive actions were carried out against the [[Jingpo|Kachins tribes]] between December 1914&ndash;February 1915, by the [[Burma Military Police]] supported by the 1/[[7th Gurkha Rifles]] and the [[64th Pioneers]].<ref>{{LondonGazette|issue= 29652|startpage=6699|supp=yes|date=4 July 1916|accessdate=2009-09-19}}</ref> Between November 1917&ndash;March 1919, operations were carried out against the [[Kuki people|Kuki tribes]] by auxiliary units of the [[Assam Rifles]] and the Burma Military Police.<ref>Reid, p.120</ref>

The other divisions remaining in India at first on internal security and then as training divisions were the [[5th (Mhow) Division]], the [[8th (Lucknow) Division]] and the [[9th (Secundarabad) Division]].<ref name=su9/> Over the course of the war these divisions lost brigades to other formations on active service; The 5th (Mhow) Division lost the 5th (Mhow) Cavalry Brigade to the [[2nd Indian Cavalry Division]]. The 8th (Lucknow) Division lost the 8th (Lucknow) Cavalry Brigade to the [[1st Indian Cavalry Division]] and the 22nd (Lucknow) Infantry Brigade to the [[11th Indian Division]]. The 9th (Secundarabad) Division lost the 9th (Secunderabad) Cavalry Brigade to the 2nd Indian Cavalry Division and the 27th (Banglore) Brigade which was sent to [[British East Africa]].<ref name=su9>Sumner, p.9</ref> The other pre war units the Burma Division, remained in [[Burma]] throughout the war on internal security duties, likewise the Aden brigade remained in Aden.<ref name=su9/>

==Independent brigades==
As well as the permanent divisions, the Indian Army also formed a number of independent brigades.  As part of the Southern Army the [[Aden Brigade]] was stationed in the [[Aden Protectorate]] on the strategically important naval route from Europe to India.<ref name=su9/> The [[Bannu Brigade]], the [[Derajat Brigade]] and the [[Kohat Brigade]] were all part of the Northern Army and they were deployed along the North West Frontier.<ref name=su9/> On 12 May 1918, the Bannu and Derajat brigades were designated as the Waziristan Field Force under the command General G W Baynon.<ref>Waziristan Campaign. Despatches published. success of operations. Reprinted from The Civil and Military Gazette of 5 May, 1918</ref>  The [[South Persia Brigade]] was formed in 1915 at the start of the [[Persian Campaign]] to protect the Anglo&ndash;Persian oil installations in south [[Persia]] and the [[Persian Gulf]].<ref name=su9/>

==Service Overseas==
The Indian Army formed and dispatched seven expeditionary forces overseas during World War II.<ref name=su6/>

===Indian Expeditionary Force A===
{{main|Western Front (World War I)}}
[[Image:IndianArmyMGCrewFlanders1914-15.jpg|left|thumb|[[2nd Rajput Light Infantry]] in action in Flanders, during the winter of 1914&ndash;15]]
On the outbreak of war the Indian Army had 150,000 trained men and the Indian Government offered the services of two cavalry and two infantry divisions for service overseas.<ref name=r97/> The force known as Indian Expeditionary Force A was under the command of General Sir [[James Willcocks]].<ref name=r97>Riddick, p.97</ref> Force A was attached to the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]] and the four divisions were formed into two [[army corps]]: an infantry [[Indian Corps]] and the [[Indian Cavalry Corps]].<ref>Sumner, p.4</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Baker|first=Chris|accessdate=2009-07-06|title=The British Corps of 1914-1918|url=http://www.1914-1918.net/corps.htm|work=The Long, Long Trail}}</ref>  Upon arrival in [[Marseilles]] on 30 September 1914, only six weeks after the declaration of war, they were moved to the [[Ypres Salient]] and took part in the [[Battle of La Bass<U+00E9>e]] in October 1914.<ref name=su5>Sumner, p.5</ref>  In March 1915, the [[7th (Meerut) Division]] was chosen to lead the assault in the [[Battle of Neuve Chapelle]].<ref name=su5/> The Expeditionary Force was hampered by a lack of familiarity with new equipment, only being issued [[Lee Enfield]] rifles on their arrival in France and they had almost no artillery, relying on support from their neighbouring corps when in the front line.<ref name=su5/> They were not accustomed to the continental weather and were poorly equipped to resist the cold, leading to low morale which was further compounded by the reserve system, whereby reinforcements were drafted in from any regiment and had no affiliation to their new units. Officer casualties were even more of a handicap, as replacements were unfamiliar with the Indian Army and could not speak the language.<ref name=su5/>  The infantry divisions were finally withdrawn to Egypt in October 1915, when they were replaced by the new British divisions of [[Kitchener's Army]].<ref name=su5/>

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-2004-0195, Westfront, indische Kavallerie.jpg|thumb|right|Indian Cavalry on the Western front 1914]]
With the withdrawal of the infantry divisions, the only Indian Army units on the Western Front were the two cavalry divisions. In November 1916, the two Indian cavalry divisions were renumbered from [[1st Indian Cavalry Division|1st]] and [[2nd Indian Cavalry Division|2nd]] to the 4th and 5th Cavalry Divisions.<ref>{{cite web|last=Baker|first=Chris|accessdate=2009-09-09|title=The Mounted Divisions of 1914-1918|url=http://www.1914-1918.net/mtddivs.htm|work=The Long, Long Trail}}</ref> Serving alongside British cavalry divisions they were held behind the front line awaiting the hoped for breakthrough. At times during the war they served in the trenches as infantry, each cavalry brigade when dismounted formed a dismounted regiment.  This meant that when the divisions went into the front line, they could only cover a brigade area.<ref>{{cite web|last=Baker|first=Chris|accessdate=2009-09-09|title=The 2nd Indian Cavalry Division in 1914-1918|url=http://www.1914-1918.net/2cavdiv_indian.htm|work=The Long, Long Trail}}</ref> Before being themselves withdrawn to Egypt in March 1918, they took part in the [[Battle of the Somme]], the [[Battle of Bazentin]], the [[Battle of Flers-Courcelette]], the advance to the [[Hindenburg Line]] and finally the [[Battle of Cambrai (1917)|Battle of Cambrai]].<ref name=su5/> 

Of the 130,000 Indians who served in France and Belgium, almost 9,000 died.<ref name="CWrepdirect">{{cite web|url=http://www.cwgc.org/admin/files/cwgc_india.pdf|title=Commonwealth War Graves Commission Report on India 2007<U+2013>2008|accessdate=2009-09-07|publisher=[[Commonwealth War Graves Commission]]}}</ref>

===Indian Expeditionary Force B===
{{main|East African Campaign (World War I)}}
In 1914, the Governor of [[British East Africa]] requested assistance to deal with the German forces in [[German East Africa]] and the problem was handed to the [[India Office]], which assembled two forces and shipped them to his aid.<ref name=ch11>Chappell (2005), p.11</ref> Indian Expeditionary Force B consisted of the 27th (Banglore) Brigade from the [[9th (Secunderabad) Division]] and an [[Imperial Service Infantry Brigade]], a pioneer battalion, a mountain artillery battery and engineers were sent to [[Tanganyika]] with the task of invading German East Africa.<ref>Chappell (2005), pp.11&ndash;12</ref>
The force under the command of Major General [[Arthur Aitken]] landed at [[Tanga, Tanzania|Tanga]] on the 2&ndash;3 November 1914. In the following [[Battle of Tanga]], Aitkens 8,000 men were badly beaten by the 1,000 men under their German commander [[Paul Emil von Lettow-Vorbeck]].<ref name=ch12>Chappell (2005), p.12</ref> The force re&ndash;embarked on 5 November 1914, having suffered 817 casualties and the loss of several hundred rifles, 16 machine guns and 600,000 rounds of ammunition.<ref name=ch12/>

===Indian Expeditionary Force C===
[[Image:10pounderMountainGunEastAfricaWWI.jpg|left|thumb|Indian Army [[10 pounder]] Mountain Gun crew in action, East Africa.]]
Indian Expeditionary Force C was the second force assembled for service in British East Africa in 1914, this force was formed from the [[Imperial Service Infantry Brigade]] of five infantry battalions and consisted of the Indian Army's [[29th Punjabis]], together with battalions from the Princely states of [[Jind]], [[Bharatpur, India|Bharatpur]], [[Kapurthala]] and [[Rampur, Uttar Pradesh|Rampur]], a volunteer [[Ordnance BL 15 pounder|15 pounder]] artillery battery, [[22nd (Derajat) Mountain Battery (Frontier Force)]], a volunteer [[maxim gun]] battery and a Field Ambulance. It was planned that the force was to be primarily used to guard the railway to [[Uganda]] and to support the [[King's African Rifles]] in communications protection duties.  After arriving in [[Mombasa]], Force C was broken up and its units subsequently served separately.<ref name=su6/> The one action they were involved in was the [[Battle of Kilimanjaro]], in October 1914. Force C with 4,000 men gathered near the border of British and German East Africa, commanded by Brigadier General J. M. Stewart. Flawed intelligence reports estimated the German military presence in the region at 200 men; however, there were 600 [[askari]]s in three companies plus the colonial volunteers, 86 young Germans on horseback.<ref>Hoyt, p.55</ref> On 3 November 1914, some 1,500 [[Punjab (British India)|Punjabis]] of the British force advanced up the slope at night near Longido were caught in the crossfire of a strong German defensive position as they advanced in the morning fog.  The large force of Indian infantry effectively resisted counter attacks, however, during the day the British attackers made no headway and suffered substantial casualties. By mid-morning, a German mounted patrol ambushed a supply column and roughly 100 mules carrying water for the troops were stampeded away by the Germans. The British officers, with their now widely scattered troops, waited until darkness and having determined their situation to be untenable, withdrew down the mountain and marched back to British East Africa having accomplished nothing.<ref>Hoyt, p.56</ref><ref>Miller, p.72</ref>

The largest Indian Army force to serve abroad was the Indian Expeditionary Force D in [[Mesopotamia]], under the command of [[John Nixon (Indian Army officer)|Lieutenant-General Sir John Nixon]].<ref name=su5/> The first unit sent in November 1914, was the [[6th (Poona) Division]] and they were tasked with guarding British oil installations in and around [[Basra]].<ref name=su6/>  As part of the [[Mesopotamian campaign]] they served under the command of [[Arthur Barrett (Indian Army officer)|Major General Barrett]] and then under [[Charles Vere Ferrers Townshend|Major General Townshend]].  After a string of early successes, the campaign was delivered a setback at the [[Battle of Ctesiphon (1915)|Battle of Ctesiphon]] in November 1915 due to Logistical constraints.<ref name=su6>Sumner, p.6</ref> Following this engagement, the Poona Division withdrew back to [[Kut]], where Townshend made the decision to hold the city and the [[Siege of Kut]] began.

Between January and March 1916, Townshend launched several attacks in an attempt to lift the siege. In sequence, the attacks took place at the [[Battle of Sheikh Sa'ad]], the [[Battle of Wadi (1916)|Battle of the Wadi]], the [[Battle of Hanna]], and the [[Battle of Dujaila|Battle of Dujaila Redoubt]].<ref name=Mesopotamia/> [[File:Indian army soldier after siege of Kut q79446.jpg|left|160px|thumb|An emaciated Indian army soldier who survived the Siege of Kut]]These attempts to break through the encirclement did not succeed and the cost was heavy with both sides suffering high casualties. In February food, and hopes were running out for Townshend in Kut-al-Amara. Disease spread rapidly and could not be contained or cured and Townshend surrendered in April 1916.<ref name=su6/> In December 1916, the 3rd and 7th Divisions arrived from the Western Front.<ref>{{cite web|last=Baker|first=Chris|accessdate=2009-09-17|title=Mesopotamia|url=http://www.1914-1918.net/mespot.htm}}</ref>

In 1917, the British force, under [[Frederick Stanley Maude]], which now included one cavalry and seven infantry divisions from the Indian Army, in the [[III Corps (India)]]<ref name=su6/> advanced towards [[Bagdhad]] which was captured in March. The advance continued in 1918, and after the [[Battle of Sharqat]] in October, the Turkish forces surrendered and the [[Armistice of Mudros]] was signed.<ref>Karsh, p.327</ref>. The Mesopotamian campaign was largely an Indian Army campaign as the only British formations involved were the [[13th (Western) Division]] and British battalions assigned to Indian brigades.<ref name=Mesopotamia>{{cite web|last=Baker|first=Chris|accessdate=2009-09-04|title=Mesopotamia|url=http://www.1914-1918.net/mespot.htm|work=The Long, Long Trail}}</ref> In the campaign, 11,012 were killed, 3,985 died of wounds, 12,678 died of disease, 13,492 were either missing or prisoners (including the 9,000 prisoners from Kut), and 51,836 were wounded.<ref>"Statistics of the Military Effort of the British Empire" (London: [[HMSO]], 1920)</ref>

===Indian Expeditionary Force F===
{{main|First Suez Offensive}}
Indian Expeditionary Force F consisted of the [[10th Indian Division]] and the [[11th Indian Division]] both of which were formed in Egypt in 1914, to defend the Suez canal. Other formations attached were the regular 22nd Lucknow Infantry Brigade from the [[8th Lucknow Division]] without their British battalions and an [[Imperial Service Cavalry Brigade]].<ref>Rinaldi, p.125</ref> 
 
The 10th Division was disbanded in 1916, and its brigades assigned to other formations.<ref name=su6/> The 28th Brigade, was assigned to the 7th (Meerut) Division in 1915, the 29th Brigade served as a independent brigade in the Gallipoli campaign until being disbanded in June 1917.

The 11th Division was disbanded earlier in 1915, but its brigades did not survive much longer.<ref name=su6/>  The 31st Brigade joined the 10th Division in January 1916, but was disbanded a month later. The 32nd Brigade was disbanded in January 1916. The 33rd Brigade was sent to [[Bushire]] in Persia in August 1915, and then disbanded in December 1915.<ref name=IAB/>

===Indian Expeditionary Force G===
{{main|Gallipoli Campaign}}
In April 1915, Indian Expeditionary Force G was sent to reinforce the Gallipoli Campaign.<ref name="CWrepdirect"/> It consisted of the 29th Brigade, serving away from its parent [[10th Indian Division]].<ref name=su6/>  The brigade was dispatched from Egypt and attached to the British [[29th Division (United Kingdom)|29th Division]] which had been decimated in the earlier battles.<ref>Haythornthwaite, p.55</ref> Held in reserve for the [[Second Battle of Krithia]] they played a major part in the [[Third Battle of Krithia]]. Advancing on the left the Brigade was quickly halted except along the Aegean shore where the 1/[[6th Gurkha Rifles]] managed to advance. The [[14th Ferozepore Sikhs]], advancing along the floor of Gully Ravine, were almost wiped out, losing 380 men out of 514 and 80% of their officers. The Brigade was next involved in the [[Battle of Gully Ravine]] and here the 2/[[10th Gurkha Rifles]] managed to advance half a mile. The Brigade next took part in the [[Battle of Sari Bair]], under cover of a naval bombardment the 1/6th Gurkha Rifles assaulted and captured the hill, which was then shelled by the [[Royal Navy]]. With their casualties mounting and under command of the battalion medical officer they were forced to withdraw to their starting positions.<ref>Haythornthwaite, p.73</ref> With the failure of the assault at Sari Bair the brigade was withdrawn to Egypt.
