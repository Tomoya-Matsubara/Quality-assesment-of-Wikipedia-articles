'''Frogs''' are a diverse and largely [[Carnivore|carnivorous]] group of short-bodied, tailless [[amphibian]]s composing the [[order (biology)|order]] '''Anura''' ([[Ancient Greek]] ''an-,'' without + ''oura'', tail). The [[Triadobatrachus|oldest fossil "proto-frog"]] appeared in the [[early Triassic]] of Madagascar, but [[molecular clock|molecular clock dating]] suggests their origins may extend further back to the [[Permian]], 265 million years ago. Frogs are widely distributed, ranging from the [[tropics]] to [[subarctic]] regions, but the greatest concentration of [[species diversity]] is found in [[tropical rainforest]]s. There are approximately 4,800 recorded species, accounting for over 85% of extant amphibian species. They are also one of the five most diverse [[vertebrate]] orders.

The [[body plan]] of an adult frog is generally characterized by a stout body, protruding [[eye]]s, cleft [[tongue]], limbs folded underneath and the absence of a [[tail]]. Besides living in fresh water and on dry land, the adults of some species are adapted for living underground or in trees.  The skin of the frog is [[gland]]ular, with secretions ranging from distasteful to toxic. Warty species of frog tend to be called [[toad]]s. Frog warts are elevations in the skin where [[bufotoxins|glandular toxins]] tend to concentrate. The distinction between frogs and toads is based on informal naming conventions concentrating on the warts rather than [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] or evolutionary history; some toads are more closely related to frogs than other toads. Frogs' skins vary in colour from well-[[camouflage]]d dappled brown, grey and green to vivid patterns of bright red or yellow and black to advertise toxicity and [[Aposematism|warn off predators]].

Frogs typically lay their [[egg (biology)|eggs]] in water. The eggs hatch into aquatic [[larva]]e, called [[tadpole]]s, that have tails and internal [[gill]]s. They have highly specialized rasping mouth parts suitable for [[herbivore|herbivorous]], [[omnivore|omnivorous]] or [[planktivore|planktivorous]] diets. The [[biological life cycle|life cycle]] is completed when they [[Metamorphosis|metamorphose]] into adults. A few species deposit eggs on land or bypass the tadpole stage. Adult frogs generally have a carnivorous diet consisting of small invertebrates, but omnivorous species exist and a few feed on fruit. Frogs are extremely efficient at converting what they eat into body mass, which makes them an important food source for [[Predation|predators]].  Frogs are a [[Keystone species|keystone group]] in the [[food web]] dynamics of many of the world's [[ecosystem]]s. The skin is [[semi-permeable]], making them susceptible to dehydration, so they either live in moist places or have special adaptations to deal with dry habitats. Frogs produce a wide range of [[Animal communication|vocalizations]], particularly in their [[breeding season]], and exhibit many different kinds of complex [[Ethology|behaviours]] to attract mates, to fend off predators and to generally survive.

Frog populations have declined significantly since the 1950s. More than one third of species are considered to be [[Threatened species|threatened]] with [[extinct]]ion and over one hundred and twenty are believed to have become extinct since the 1980s.<ref name=Stuart/> The number of malformations among frogs is on the rise and an emerging [[fungus|fungal]] disease, [[chytridiomycosis]], has spread around the world. [[Conservation biology|Conservation biologists]] are working to understand the causes of these problems and to resolve them. Frogs are valued as food by humans and also have many cultural roles in literature, symbolism and religion.

== Etymology and taxonomy ==
The name frog derives from [[Old English]] ''frogga'', abbreviated to ''frox'', ''forsc'' and ''frosc'', probably deriving from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] ''preu'' = "to jump".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=frog |title=Frog |author=Harper, Douglas |work=Online Etymology Dictionary |accessdate=2012-10-02}}</ref> Approximately 88% of [[amphibian]] species are [[Biological classification|classified]] in the [[Order (biology)|order]] ''Anura''.<ref name="Pou92">{{cite book |title=Herpetology: Third Edition |last=Pough |first=F.

The use of the common names "frog" and "toad" has no taxonomic justification. From a classification perspective, all members of the order Anura are frogs, but only members of the family [[Bufonidae]] are considered "true toads". The use of the term "frog" in common names usually refers to species that are aquatic or semi-aquatic and have smooth, moist skins; the term "toad" generally refers to species that are terrestrial with dry, warty skins.<ref name=Salientia/><ref>{{cite book |title=Frogs |last=Badger |first=D. |coauthors=Netherton, J. |year=1995 |publisher=Airlife Publishing |isbn=1-85310-740-9 |page=19 }}</ref> There are numerous exceptions to this rule.

Anura includes all modern frogs and any [[fossil]] species that fit within the anuran definition. The characteristics of anuran adults include: nine or fewer presacral vertebrae, a long and forward sloping ilium, the presence of a [[Coccyx|urostyle]], no tail, shorter forelimb than hindlimb, [[Radius (bone)|radius]] and [[ulna]] fused, [[tibia]] and [[fibula]] fused, elongate [[ankle bone]]s, absence of a prefrontal bone, presence of a [[hyoid bone|hyoid plate]], a lower jaw without teeth, an unsupported tongue, [[lymph]] spaces underneath the skin and a muscle, the protractor lentis, attached to the [[Lens (anatomy)|lens of the eye]].<ref name=ToLAnura>{{cite web |url=http://www.tolweb.org/Anura/16963 |title=Anura |author=Cannatella, David |date=2008-01-11 |publisher=Tree of Life web project |accessdate=2012-08-08}}</ref> The anuran larva or tadpole has a single central respiratory [[spiracle]] and mouthparts consisting of [[keratin]]ous [[beak]]s and [[denticle]]s.<ref name=ToLAnura/>

Frogs and toads are broadly classified into three suborders: [[Archaeobatrachia]], which includes four families of primitive frogs; [[Mesobatrachia]], which includes five families of more evolutionary intermediate frogs; and [[Neobatrachia]], by far the largest group, which contains the remaining 24 families of modern frogs, including most common species found throughout the world. Neobatrachia is further divided into the two superfamilies [[Hyloidea]] and [[Ranoidea]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ford| first=L.S.| coauthors= Cannatella, D.

While this classification is largely accepted, relationships among families of frogs are still debated.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Faivovich| first=J.| coauthors=Haddad, C. F. B.; Garcia, P. C.

Some species of anurans [[hybrid (biology)|hybridize]] readily. For instance, the [[edible frog]] (''Pelophylax esculentus'') is a hybrid between the [[pool frog]] (''Pelophylax lessonae'') and the [[marsh frog]] (''Pelophylax ridibundus'').<ref>{{cite web |url=http://amphibiaweb.org/cgi-bin/amphib_query?query_src=aw_search_index&where-genus=Pelophylax&where-species=esculentus |title=''Pelophylax esculentus'' |author=Kuzmin, S.

These are less fertile than their parents, giving rise to a [[hybrid zone]] where the hybrids are prevalent.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://edoc.ub.uni-muenchen.de/1521/1/Koehler_Sonja.pdf |title=Mechanisms for partial reproductive isolation in a ''Bombina'' hybrid zone in Romania |author=K<U+00F6>hler, S. |year=2003 |work=Dissertation for thesis |accessdate=2012-06-05}}</ref>

== Evolution ==
The origins and evolutionary relationships between the three main groups of amphibians is hotly debated. A [[molecular phylogeny]] based on [[Ribosomal DNA|rDNA]] analysis dating from 2005 suggests that [[salamanders]] and [[caecilian]]s are more closely related to each other than they are to frogs, and that the [[Genetic divergence|divergence]] of the three groups took place in the [[Paleozoic]] or early [[Mesozoic]] before the breakup of the supercontinent [[Pangaea]] and soon after their divergence from the [[Sarcopterygii|lobe-finned fish]]. This would help account for the relative scarcity of amphibian fossils from the period before the groups split.<ref>{{cite journal |author=San Mauro, Diego; Vences, Miguel; Alcobendas, Marina; Zardoya, Rafael; Meyer, Axel |year=2005 |title=Initial Diversification of living amphibians predated the breakup of Pangaea |journal=The American Naturalist |volume=165 |issue=5 |pages=590<U+2013>599 |jstor=429523 |doi=10.1086/429523 |pmid=15795855 }}{{subscription required}}</ref> Another molecular phylogenetic analysis conducted about the same time concluded that [[lissamphibian]]s first appeared about 330 million years ago and that the [[Temnospondyli|temnospondyl-origin]] hypothesis is more credible than other theories.

The study postulated that Lissamphibia originated no earlier than the late [[Carboniferous]], some 290 to 305 million years ago. The split between Anura and [[Caudata]] was estimated as taking place 292 million years ago, rather later than most molecular studies suggest, with the caecilians splitting off 239 million years ago.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Pyron, R.

[[File:Fossilised frog.jpg|thumb|left|A fossilized frog from the [[Czech Republic]], possibly ''[[Palaeobatrachus gigas]]'']]

In 2008, ''[[Gerobatrachus hottoni]]'', a [[Temnospondyli|temnospondyl]] with many frog- and salamander-like characteristics, was discovered in [[Texas]]. It dated back 290 million years and was hailed as a [[Transitional fossil|missing link]], a [[Stem group|stem]] batrachian close to the [[common ancestor]] of frogs and salamanders, consistent with the widely accepted hypothesis that frogs and salamanders are more closely related to each other (forming a [[clade]] called Batrachia) than they are to caecilians.<ref>{{cite news |title="Frog-amander" fossil may be amphibian missing link |author=Casselman, Anne |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2008/05/080521-frog-fossil.html |newspaper=National Geographic News |date=2008-05-21 |accessdate=2012-07-05}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Anderson, Jason S.; Reisz, Robert R.; Scott, Diane; Fr<U+00F6>bisch, Nadia B.; Sumida, Stuart S. |year=2008 |title=A stem batrachian from the Early Permian of Texas and the origin of frogs and salamanders |journal=Nature |volume=453 |pages=515<U+2013>518 |doi=10.1038/nature06865 |issue=7194 |pmid=18497824 }}</ref> The earliest known salientians (see below), closer to the extant frogs than to the extant salamanders, are ''[[Triadobatrachus]] massinoti'', from the Early [[Triassic]] of [[Madagascar]] (about 250 million years ago), and the fragmentary ''[[Czatkobatrachus]] polonicus'' from the Early Triassic of [[Poland]] (about the same age as ''Triadobatrachus'').<ref name=TOLweb>{{cite web |last=Cannatella |first=David |title=''Triadobatrachus massinoti'' |url=http://www.tolweb.org/Triadobatrachus_massinoti/16962 |work=Tree of Life |year=1995 |accessdate=2008-06-26 }}</ref> The skull of ''Triadobatrachus'' is frog-like, being broad with large eye sockets, but the fossil has features diverging from modern frogs.

The tibia and fibula bones are also separate, making it probable that ''Triadobatrachus'' was not an efficient leaper.<ref name=TOLweb/>

Salientia (Latin ''salere'' (''salio''), "to jump") is a [[stem group]] including modern frogs in the order Anura and their close fossil relatives the "proto-frogs" (e.g., ''[[Triadobatrachus]]'' and ''[[Czatkobatrachus]]''). The common features possessed by the "proto-frogs" in the [[Salientia]] group include fourteen [[Vertebral column|presacral vertebrae]] (modern frogs have eight or nine), a long and forward-sloping [[Ilium (bone)|ilium]] in the [[pelvis]], the presence of a [[Parietal bone|frontoparietal bone]] and a [[Mandible|lower jaw]] without teeth.

The earliest known "true frog" is ''[[Vieraella herbsti]]'', from the Early Jurassic. It is known only from the [[dorsum (biology)|dorsal]] and [[ventral]] impressions of a single animal and was estimated to be {{convert|33|mm|abbr=on}} from snout to vent. ''[[Notobatrachus degiustoi]]'' from the middle Jurassic is slightly younger, about 155<U+2013>170 million years old. The main evolutionary changes in this species involved the shortening of the body and the loss of the tail. It is likely that the evolution of modern ''Anura'' was complete by the Jurassic period. Since then, evolutionary changes in [[Ploidy|chromosome numbers]] have taken place about twenty times faster in mammals than in frogs, which means that [[speciation]] is occurring more rapidly in mammals.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Wilson, A.

[[File:Rana skeleton.png|thumb|upright|alt=Skeleton of frog|Skeleton of ''[[edible frog|Pelophylax esculentus]]'' showing bones of the head, vertebral column, ribs, pectoral and pelvic girdles and limbs]]
Frogs have no tail, except as larvae, and most have long hind legs, elongated ankle bones, webbed toes, no claws, large eyes and a smooth or warty skin. They have a short vertebral column, with no more than ten free vertebrae and a fused tailbone (urostyle or coccyx).<ref name=Flam>{{cite web|author=Flam, F.| year=1995 |title=Finding earliest true frog will help paleontologists understand how frog evolved its jumping ability |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-17454183.html |publisher=Knight Ridder/Tribune News Service via [[HighBeam Research]]|accessdate=2012-06-10}}</ref> Like other amphibians, [[oxygen]] can pass through their highly permeable skins.

The skin hangs loosely on the body because of the lack of [[loose connective tissue]]. Frogs have three eyelid membranes: one is transparent to protect the eyes underwater, and two vary from translucent to opaque. They have a [[tympanum (zoology)|tympanum]] on each side of the head which is involved in hearing and, in some species, is covered by skin. True toads completely lack teeth but most frogs have them, specifically [[pedicellate teeth]] in which the crown is separated from the root by fibrous tissue. These are on the edge of the upper jaw and there are also [[vomerine teeth]] on the roof of the mouth. There are no teeth in the lower jaw and frogs usually swallow their food whole. The teeth are mainly used to grip the prey and keep it in place till swallowed, a process assisted by retracting the eyes into the head.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Levine |first1=R.

=== Feet and legs ===
The structure of the feet and legs varies greatly among frog species, depending in part on whether they live primarily on the ground, in water, in trees or in burrows. Frogs must be able to move quickly through their environment to catch prey and escape predators, and numerous adaptations help them to do so. Most frogs are either proficient at jumping or are descended from ancestors who were, with much of the [[musculo-skeletal]] [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] modified for this purpose. The tibia, fibula and [[tarsus (skeleton)|tarsals]] have been fused into a single, strong [[bone]], as have the radius and ulna in the [[forelimb]]s (which must absorb the impact on landing). The [[metatarsals]] have become elongated to add to the [[leg]] length and allow the frog to push against the ground for a longer period on take-off. The [[illium]] has elongated and formed a mobile joint with the [[sacrum]] which, in specialist jumpers such as ranids and hylids, functions as an additional limb joint to further power the leaps. The tail vertebrae have fused into a urostyle which is retracted inside the pelvis. This enables the force to be transferred from the legs to the body during a leap.<ref name=Flam/>

[[File:Litoria tyleri.jpg|thumb|[[Tyler's tree frog]] (''Litoria tyleri'') has large toe pads and webbed feet]]

The muscular system has been similarly modified. The hind limbs of ancestral frogs presumably contained pairs of muscles which would act in opposition (one muscle to flex the knee, a different muscle to extend it), as is seen in most other limbed animals. However, in modern frogs, almost all muscles have been modified to contribute to the action of jumping, with only a few small muscles remaining to bring the limb back to the starting position and maintain posture. The muscles have also been greatly enlarged, with the main leg muscles accounting for over 17% of the total mass of the frog.<ref name=Frogjump/>

Many frogs have webbed feet and the degree of webbing is directly proportional to the amount of time the species spends in the water.<ref name=Exploratorium>{{cite web |url=http://www.exploratorium.edu/frogs/mainstory/ |title=The amazing adaptable frog |author=Tesler, P. |year=1999 |publisher=Exploratorium:: The museum of science, art and human perception |accessdate=2012-06-04}}</ref> The completely aquatic [[African dwarf frog]] (''Hymenochirus sp.'') has fully webbed toes, whereas those of [[White's tree frog]] (''Litoria caerulea''), an arboreal species, are only a quarter or half webbed.<ref>{{cite web |author=Vincent, L. |year=2001 |publisher=James Cook University | title=''Litoria caerulea'' | url=http://www.jcu.edu.au/school/tbiol/zoology/herp/Litoriacaerulea.PDF| accessdate=2012-08-03 }}</ref>

[[Tree frog|Arboreal frogs]] have pads located on the ends of the toes to help grip vertical surfaces. These are not suction pads, the surface consisting instead of columnar cells with flat tops with small gaps between them lubricated by mucous glands. When the frog applies pressure, the cells adhere to irregularities on the surface and the grip is maintained through [[Capillarity|surface tension]]. This allows the frog to climb on smooth surfaces but the system does not function efficiently when the pads are excessively wet.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Emerson| first=S. B.| coauthors=Diehl, D.| year=1980| title=Toe pad morphology and mechanisms of sticking in frogs| journal=Biological Journal of the Linnean Society| volume=13| issue=3| pages=199<U+2013>216| doi=10.1111/j.1095-8312.1980.tb00082.x}}</ref>

In many arboreal frogs, a small "intercalary structure" on each toe increases the surface area touching the [[Substrate (biology)|substrate]]. Furthermore, since hopping through trees can be dangerous, many arboreal frogs have hip joints that allow both hopping and walking. Some frogs that live high in trees even possess an elaborate degree of webbing between their toes. This allows the frogs to "parachute" or make a controlled glide from one position in the canopy to another.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Harvey|first=M. B.| coauthors= Pemberton, A. J.; Smith, E. N. | year=2002| title=New and poorly known parachuting frogs (Rhacophoridae : ''Rhacophorus'') from Sumatra and Java| journal=Herpetological Monographs| volume=16| pages=46<U+2013>92| doi=10.1655/0733-1347(2002)016[0046:NAPKPF]2.0.CO;2}}</ref>

Ground-dwelling frogs generally lack the adaptations of aquatic and arboreal frogs. Most have smaller toe pads, if any, and little webbing. Some burrowing frogs such as [[Couch's Spadefoot Toad|Couch's spadefoot]] (''Scaphiopus couchii'') have a flap-like toe extension on the hind feet, a [[keratin]]ised [[tubercle]] often referred to as a spade, that helps them to burrow.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.desertmuseum.org/books/nhsd_spadefoot.php |title=Couch's spadefoot (''Scaphiopus couchi'') |publisher=Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum |accessdate=2012-08-03}}</ref>

Sometimes during the tadpole stage, one of the developing rear legs is eaten by a predator such as a [[dragonfly nymph]]. In some cases, the full leg still grows but in others it does not, although the frog may still live out its normal lifespan with only three limbs. Occasionally, a parasitic [[flatworm]] (''[[Ribeiroia ondatrae]]'') digs into the rear of a tadpole, causing a rearrangement of the limb bud cells and the frog develops an extra leg or two.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/earth/hi/earth_news/newsid_8116000/8116692.stm |title=Legless frogs mystery solved | work=BBC News| date=2009-06-25|first=M.|last=Walker}}</ref>

=== Skin ===
A frog's skin is protective, has a respiratory function, can absorb water and helps control body temperature. It has many glands, particularly on the head and back, which often exude distasteful and toxic substances. The secretion is often sticky and helps keep the skin moist, protects against the entry of moulds and bacteria and make the animal slippery and more able to escape from predators.<ref>{{cite book |title=A Natural History of Amphibians |last=Stebbins |first=Robert C. |coauthors=Cohen, Nathan W. |year=1995 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=0-691-03281-5 |pages=10<U+2013>14 }}</ref> The skin is shed every few weeks. It usually splits down the middle of the back and across the belly, and the frog pulls its arms and legs free. The sloughed skin is then worked towards the head where it is quickly eaten.<ref>{{cite journal |jstor=2456779 |pages=530<U+2013>540 |last1=Frost |first1=S. W. |title=Notes on feeding and molting in frogs |volume=66 |issue=707 |journal=The American Naturalist |year=1932 |doi=10.1086/280458}}</ref>

Being cold-blooded, frogs have to adopt suitable behaviour patterns to regulate their temperature. To warm up they can move into the sun or onto a warm surface; if they overheat they can move into the shade or adopt a stance that exposes the minimum area of skin to the air. This posture is also used to prevent water loss and involves the frog squatting close to the substrate with its hands and feet tucked under its chin and body.<ref name=BandN>{{cite book |title=Frogs |last=Badger |first=D. |coauthors=Netherton, J. |year=1995 |publisher=Airlife Publishing |isbn=1-85310-740-9 |page=27 }}</ref> The colour of a frog's skin is used for thermo-regulation. In cool damp conditions the colour will be darker than on a hot dry day. The [[Grey Foam-nest Treefrog|grey foam-nest tree frog]] (''Chiromantis xerampelina'') is even able to turn white to minimize the chance of overheating.<ref>{{cite book |title=Amphibians and Their Ways |last=Smyth |first=H. R. |year=1962 |publisher=Macmillan |isbn=0-02-612190-5 }}</ref>

Many frogs are able to absorb water and oxygen directly through the skin, especially around the pelvic area, but the permeability of a frog's skin can also result in water loss. Glands located all over the body exude mucus which helps keep the skin moist and reduces evaporation. Some glands on the hands and chest of males are specialized to produce sticky secretions to aid in [[amplexus]]. Similar glands in tree frogs produce a glue-like substance on the adhesive discs of the feet. Some arboreal frogs reduce water loss by having a waterproof layer of skin and several South American species coat their skin with a waxy secretion. Others frogs have adopted behaviours to conserve water, including becoming [[nocturnal]] and resting in a water-conserving position. Some frogs may also rest in large groups with each frog pressed against its neighbours. This reduces the amount of skin exposed to the air or a dry surface, and thus reduces water loss.<ref name=BandN/> The [[Woodhouse's toad]] (''Bufo woodhousii''), if given access to water after confinement in a dry location, sits in the shallows to rehydrate.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Frog Book: North American Frogs and Toads |last=Dickerson |first=M.

[[Camouflage]] is a common defensive mechanism in frogs. Most camouflaged frogs are nocturnal; during the day, they seek out a position where they can blend into the background and remain undetected. Some frogs have the [[:Category:Animals that can change color|ability to change colour]], but this is usually restricted to a small range of colours. For example, the White's tree frog (''Litoria caerulea'') varies between pale green and dull brown according to the temperature, and the [[Pacific tree frog]] (''Pseudacris regilla'') has green and brown morphs, plain or spotted, and changes colour depending on the time of year and general background colour.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Wente, W.

=== Respiration and circulation ===
The skin of a frog is permeable to [[oxygen]] and [[carbon dioxide]], as well as to water. There are blood vessels near the surface of the skin and when a frog is underwater, oxygen diffuses directly into the blood. When not submerged, a frog breathes by a process known as [[buccal pumping]]. Its lungs are similar to those of humans but the chest muscles are not involved in respiration, and there are no [[rib]]s or [[diaphragm (anatomy)|diaphragm]] to help move air in and out. Instead, it puffs out its throat and draws air in through the nostrils, which in many species can then be closed by valves. When the floor of the mouth is compressed, air is forced into the lungs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://users.rcn.com/jkimball.ma.ultranet/BiologyPages/V/VertebrateLungs.html |title=Vertebrate Lungs: Frog Lungs |author=Kimball, John |year=2010 |work=Kimball's Biology Pages |accessdate=2012-07-09}}</ref> The [[Bornean Flat-headed Frog|Borneo flat-headed frog]] (''Barbourula kalimantanensis'') was first discovered in a remote part of Indonesia in 2007.

Frogs have three-chambered [[heart]]s, a feature they share with [[lizard]]s.<ref name=Kimball>{{cite web |url=http://users.rcn.com/jkimball.ma.ultranet/BiologyPages/A/AnimalHearts.html |title=Animal Circulatory Systems: Three Chambers: The Frog and Lizard |author=Kimball, John |year=2010 |work=Kimball's Biology Pages |accessdate=2012-07-09}}</ref> Oxygenated blood from the lungs and de-oxygenated blood from the [[Respiration (physiology)|respiring]] tissues enter the heart through separate [[atrium (anatomy)|atria]]. When these chambers contract, the two blood streams pass into a common [[Ventricle (heart)|ventricle]] before being pumped via a spiral valve to the appropriate vessel, the [[aorta]] for oxygenated blood and [[pulmonary artery]] for deoxygenated blood. The ventricle is partially divided into narrow cavities which minimizes the mixing of the two types of blood. These features enable frogs to have a higher metabolic rate and be more active than would otherwise be possible.<ref name=Kimball/>

Some species of frog have adaptations that allow them to survive in oxygen deficient water. The [[Lake Titicaca]] frog (''[[Telmatobius culeus]]'') is one such species and has  wrinkly skin that increases its surface area to enhance gas exchange. It normally makes no use of its rudimentary lungs but will sometimes raise and lower its body rhythmically while on the lake bed to increase the flow of water around it.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://amphibiaweb.org/cgi-bin/amphib_query?query_src=aw_search_index&where-genus=Telmatobius&where-species=culeus&rel-genus=equals&rel-species=equals |title=''Telmatobius culeus'' |author=Lee, Deborah |date=2010-04-23 |work=AmphibiaWeb |publisher=University of California, Berkeley |accessdate=2012-07-09}}</ref>

=== Digestion and excretion ===
Frogs have maxillary teeth along their upper jaw which are used to hold food before it is swallowed. These teeth are very weak, and cannot be used to chew or catch and harm agile prey. Instead, the frog uses its sticky, cleft tongue to catch flies and other small moving prey. The tongue normally lies coiled in the mouth, free at the back and attached to the mandible at the front. It can be shot out and retracted at great speed.<ref name=Exploratorium/> Some frogs have no tongue and just stuff food into their mouths with their hands.<ref name=Exploratorium/> The eyes assist in the swallowing of food as they can be retracted through holes in the skull and help push food down the throat.<ref name=Exploratorium/> The food then moves through the oesophagus into the stomach where digestive enzymes are added and it is churned up. It then proceeds to the small intestine (duodenum and ileum) where most digestion occurs. Pancreatic juice from the pancreas, and bile, produced by the liver and stored in the gallbladder, are secreted into the small intestine, where the fluids digest the food and the nutrients are absorbed. The food residue passes into the large intestine where excess water is removed and the wastes are passed out through the [[cloaca]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tutorvista.com/biology/frog-digestive-system-diagram |title=Frog Digestive System |year=2010 |publisher=TutorVista.com |accessdate=2012-08-04}}</ref>

Although adapted to terrestrial life, frogs resemble freshwater fish in their inability to conserve body water effectively. When they are on land, much water is lost by evaporation from the skin. The excretory system is similar to that of mammals and there are two [[kidney]]s that remove nitrogenous products from the blood. Frogs produce large quantities of dilute urine in order to flush out toxic products from the kidney tubules.<ref name=Doritexcretion>{{cite book |title=Zoology |last=Dorit |first=R. L. |coauthors=Walker, W. F.; Barnes, R. D. |year=1991 |publisher=Saunders College Publishing  |isbn=0-03-030504-7 |page=849 }}</ref> The nitrogen is excreted as [[ammonia]] by tadpoles and aquatic frogs but mainly as [[urea]], a less toxic product, by most terrestrial adults. A few species of tree frog with little access to water excrete the even less toxic [[uric acid]].<ref name=Doritexcretion/> The urine passes along paired [[ureter]]s to the [[urinary bladder]] from which it is vented periodically into the cloaca. All bodily wastes exit the body through the cloaca which terminates in a cloacal vent.<ref name=TutorVista>{{cite web |url=http://www.tutorvista.com/content/biology/biology-iii/animal-morphology/respiratory-excretory-nervous-reproductive-system-frog.php |title=Frog's internal systems |year=2010 |publisher=TutorVista.com |accessdate=2012-06-04}}</ref>

=== Reproductive system ===
In the male frog, the two [[Testis|testes]] are attached to the kidneys and [[semen]] passes into the kidneys through fine tubes called [[efferent ducts]]. It then travels on through the ureters, which are consequently known as urinogenital ducts. There is no penis, and sperm is ejected from the cloaca directly onto the eggs as the female lays them. The ovaries of the female frog are beside the kidneys and the eggs pass down a pair of oviducts and through the cloaca to the exterior.<ref name=TutorVista/>

When frogs mate, the male climbs on the back of the female and wraps his fore limbs round her body, either behind the front legs or just in front of the hind legs. This position is called [[amplexus]] and may be held for several days.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://allaboutfrogs.org/weird/general/cycle.html |title=Life cycle of a frog |author=Dorota |year=2006 |work=Frogland |accessdate=2012-08-04}}</ref> The male frog has certain hormone-dependent [[secondary sexual characteristic]]s. These include  the development of special pads on his thumbs in the breeding season, to give him a firm hold.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www2.southeastern.edu/Academics/Faculty/dsever/SeverandStaub.pdf |title=Hormones, sex accessory structures, and secondary sexual characteristics in amphibians |author=Sever, David M.; Staub, Nancy L. |pages=83<U+2013>98 |work=Hormones and Reproduction of Vertebrates&nbsp;<U+2013> Vol 2: Amphibians |accessdate=2012-08-04}}</ref> The grip of the male frog during amplexus stimulates the female to release eggs, usually wrapped in jelly, as spawn.<ref name=TutorVista/> In many species the male is smaller and slimmer than the female. Males have vocal cords and make a range of croaks, particularly in the breeding season, and in some species they also have [[vocal sac]]s to amplify the sound.<ref name=TutorVista/>

=== Nervous system ===
The frog has a highly developed nervous system that consists of a brain, spinal cord and nerves. Many parts of the frog's brain correspond with those of humans. It consists of two olfactory lobes, two cerebral hemispheres, a pineal body, two optic lobes, a cerebellum and a medulla oblongata. Muscular coordination and posture are controlled by the [[cerebellum]], and the [[medulla oblongata]] regulates respiration, digestion and other automatic functions.<ref name=TutorVista/> The relative size of the [[cerebrum]] in frogs is much smaller than it is in humans. Frogs have ten pairs of [[cranial nerves]] which pass information from the outside directly to the brain, and ten pairs of [[spinal nerves]] which pass information from the extremities to the brain through the spinal cord.<ref name=TutorVista/>  By contrast, all [[amniotes]] (mammals, birds and reptiles) have twelve pairs of cranial nerves.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tolweb.org/Amniota |title=Amniota |author=Laurin, Michel; Gauthier, Jacques A. |year=2012  |publisher=Tree of Life Web Project |accessdate=2012-08-04}}</ref>

=== Sight ===
The eyes of most frogs are located on either side of the head near the top and project outwards as hemispherical bulges. They provide [[binocular vision]] over a field of 100<U+00B0> to the front and a total visual field of almost 360<U+00B0>.<ref name=Howard>{{cite book |title=Binocular Vision and Stereopsis |last=Howard |first=Ian, P. |coauthors=Rogers, Brian J. |year=1995 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0195084764 |page=651 |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=I8vqITdETe0C&pg=PA651&lpg=PA651&dq=do+frogs+have+stereoscopic+vision&source=bl&ots=JgfH1YCnHs&sig=yQPl3D5Y91VmO09LVFN_uz7qM9E&hl=en&sa=X&ei=bR2FUOW3HcOk0QWI5YHIAw&ved=0CEMQ6AEwBjgK#v=onepage&q=Amphibia&f=false }}</ref> They may be the only part of an otherwise submerged frog to protrude from the water.

The irises of the [[southern toad]] (''Anaxyrus terrestris'') are patterned so as to blend in with the surrounding camouflaged skin.<ref name=Badger/>

=== Hearing ===
Frogs can hear both in the air and below water. They do not have external ears; the eardrums ([[Tympanum (anatomy)|tympanic membranes]]) are directly exposed or may be covered by a layer of skin and are visible as a circular area just behind the eye. The size and distance apart of the eardrums is related to the frequency and wavelength at which the frog calls. In some species such as the bullfrog, the size of the tympanum indicates the sex of the frog; males have tympani that are larger than their eyes while in females, the eyes and tympani are much the same size.<ref name=Neth38>{{cite book |title=Frogs |last=Badger |first=David |coauthors=Netherton, John |year=1995 |publisher=Airlife Publishing |isbn=1-85310-740-9 |page=38 }}</ref> A noise causes the tympanum to vibrate and the sound is transmitted to the middle and inner ear. The middle ear contains semicircular canals which help control balance and orientation.

The former detects high frequencies and the latter low frequencies.<ref name=Cohen>{{cite book |title=A Natural History of Amphibians |last=Stebbins |first=Robert C. |coauthors=Cohen, Nathan W. |year=1995 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=0-691-03281-5 |pages=67<U+2013>69 }}</ref> Because the cochlea is short, frogs use [[electrical tuning]] to extend their range of audible frequencies and help discriminate different sounds.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Armstrong, Cecilia E.; Roberts, William M. |year=1998 |title=Electrical properties of frog saccular hair cells: distortion by enzymatic dissociation |journal=Journal of Neuroscience |volume=18 |issue=8 |pages= 2962<U+2013>2973 |url=http://www.jneurosci.org/content/18/8/2962.full |pmid=9526013 }}</ref> This arrangement enables detection of the territorial and breeding calls of their [[Conspecificity|conspecifics]].

=== Call ===
{{See also|Sexual selection in frogs}}
[[File:Dendropsophus microcephalus - calling male (Cope, 1886).jpg|thumb|A male ''[[Dendropsophus microcephalus]]'' displaying its vocal sac during its call]]
[[File:Atelopus franciscus male territorial call - pone.0022080.s002.oga|thumb|Advertisement call of male ''[[Atelopus franciscus]]'']]

The call or croak of a frog is unique to its species. Frogs create this sound by passing air through the [[larynx]] in the throat. In most calling frogs, the sound is amplified by one or more vocal sacs, membranes of skin under the throat or on the corner of the mouth, that distend during the amplification of the call. Some frog calls are so loud that they can be heard up to a mile away.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dnr.state.oh.us/Home/species_a_to_z/SpeciesGuideIndex/bullfrog/tabid/6576/Default.aspx |title=Bullfrog |publisher=Ohio Department of Natural Resources |accessdate=2012-06-19}}</ref>

Frogs in the genera ''[[Heleioporus]]'' and ''[[Neobatrachus]]'' lack vocal sacs but can still produce a loud call. Their [[mouth|buccal cavity]] is enlarged and dome-shaped, acting as a [[resonance chamber]] that amplifies the sound. Species of frog that lack vocal sacs and that do not have a loud call tend to inhabit areas close to constantly noisy, flowing water. They need to use an alternative means to communicate. The [[Ascaphus truei|coastal tailed frog]] (''Ascaphus truei'') lives in mountain streams in North America and does not vocalize.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.californiaherps.com/frogs/pages/a.truei.html |title=''Ascaphus truei'': Coastal Tailed Frog |author=Nafis, Gary |year=2012  |publisher=California Herps |accessdate=2012-06-19}}</ref>

The main reason for calling is to allow male frogs to attract a mate. Males may call individually or there may be a chorus of sound where numerous males have converged on breeding sites. Females of many frog species, such as the [[Common Tree Frog|common tree frog]] (''Polypedates leucomystax''), reply to the male calls, which acts to reinforce reproductive activity in a breeding colony.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Roy| first=Debjani| year=1997| title=Communication signals and sexual selection in amphibians| journal=Current Science| volume=72| pages= 923<U+2013>927 | url=http://www.ias.ac.in/jarch/currsci/72/00000944.pdf |format=PDF }}</ref> Female frogs prefer males that produce sounds of greater intensity and lower frequency, attributes that stand out in a crowd. The rationale for this is thought to be that by demonstrating his prowess, the male shows his fitness to produce superior offspring.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gerhardt, H. C. |year=1994 |title=The evolution of vocalization in frogs and toads |journal=Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics |volume=25 |pages=293<U+2013>324 |doi=10.1146/annurev.es.25.110194.001453 }}</ref>

A different call is emitted by a male frog or unreceptive female when mounted by another male. This is a distinct chirruping sound and is accompanied by a vibration of the body.<ref name=Badger3>{{cite book |title=Frogs |last=Badger |first=David |authorlink= |coauthors=Netherton, John |year=1995 |publisher=Airlife Publishing Ltd |isbn=1-85310-740-9 |pages=39<U+2013>44 }}</ref> Tree frogs and some non-aquatic species have a rain call that they make on the basis of humidity cues prior to a shower.<ref name=Badger3/> Many species also have a territorial call that is used to drive away other males. All of these calls are emitted with the mouth of the frog closed.<ref name=Badger3/> A distress call, emitted by some frogs when they are in danger, is produced with the mouth open resulting in a higher-pitched call. It is typically used when the frog has been grabbed by a predator and may serve to distract or disorientate the attacker so that it releases the frog.<ref name=Badger3/>

Many species of frog have deep calls. The croak of the [[American bullfrog]] (''Rana catesbiana'') is sometimes written as "jug o' rum".<ref>{{cite book|last=Hilton|first=Bill Jr.|title=Jug-o-Rum: Call of the Amorous Bullfrog |work=The Piedmont Naturalist |publisher=Hilton Pond Center for Piedmont Natural History |volume=1 |year=1986<!-- |accessdate=2008-06-26-->}}</ref> The [[Pacific Tree Frog|Pacific tree frog]] (''Pseudacris regilla'') produces the [[onomatopoeia|onomatopoeic]] "ribbit" often heard in films.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.beachwatchers.wsu.edu/island/essays/TreeFrogs.htm |title=The RRRRRRRRiveting Life of  Tree Frogs |last=Nash |first=Pat |date=2005-02 |accessdate=2012-08-04}}</ref> Other renderings of frog calls into speech include "brekekekex koax koax", the call of the marsh frog (''[[Pelophylax ridibundus]]'') in ''The Frogs'', an Ancient Greek comic drama by [[Aristophanes]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://records.viu.ca/~johnstoi/aristophanes/frogs.htm |title=The Frogs |author=Aristophanes |accessdate=2012-06-19}}</ref>

=== Torpor ===
During extreme conditions, some frogs enter a state of [[torpor]] and remain inactive for months. In colder regions, many species of frog [[Hibernation|hibernate]] in winter. Those that live on land such as the [[American toad]] (''Bufo americanus'') dig a burrow and make a [[Hibernaculum (zoology)|hibernaculum]] in which to lie [[Dormancy|dormant]]. Others, less proficient at digging, find a crevice or bury themselves in dead leaves. Aquatic species such as the [[American bullfrog]] (''Rana catesbeiana'') normally sink to the bottom of the pond where they lie, semi-immersed in mud but still able to access the oxygen dissolved in the water. Their metabolism slows down and they live on their energy reserves. Some frogs can even survive being frozen. Ice crystals form under the skin and in the body cavity but the essential organs are protected from freezing by a high concentration of glucose. An apparently lifeless, frozen frog can resume respiration and the heart beat can restart when conditions warm up.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=how-do-frogs-survive-wint |title=How do frogs survive winter? Why don't they freeze to death? |author=Emmer, Rick |date=1997-11-24 |publisher=Scientific American |accessdate=2012-06-15}}</ref>

At the other extreme, the [[striped burrowing frog]] (''Cyclorana alboguttata'') regularly [[Aestivation|aestivates]] during the hot, dry season in Australia, surviving in a dormant state without access to food and water for nine or ten months of the year. It burrows underground and curls up inside a protective [[Cocoon (silk)|cocoon]] formed by its shed skin. Researchers at the [[University of Queensland]] have found that during aestivation, the [[metabolism]] of the frog is altered and the operational efficiency of the [[mitochondria]] is increased. This means that the limited amount of energy available to the comatose frog is used in a more efficient manner. This survival mechanism is only useful to animals that remain completely unconscious for an extended period of time and whose energy requirements are low because they are cold-blooded and have no need to generate heat.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kayes, Sara M.; Cramp, Rebecca L.; Franklin, Craig E. |year=2009 |title=Metabolic depression during aestivation in ''Cyclorana alboguttata'' |journal=Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology&nbsp;<U+2013> Part A: Molecular & Integrative Physiology |volume=154 |issue=4 |pages=557<U+2013>563 |doi=10.1016/j.cbpa.2009.09.001 }}</ref> Other research showed that, to provide these energy requirements, muscles atrophy, but hind limb muscles are preferentially unaffected.<ref>{{cite journal |author= Hudson, N.

== Locomotion ==
Different species of frog use a number of methods of moving around including [[jumping]], [[running]], [[walking]], [[aquatic locomotion|swimming]], [[burrow]]ing, [[climbing]] and [[Flying frog|gliding]].

Slow motion photography shows that the muscles have passive flexibility. They are first stretched while the frog is still in the crouched position, then they are contracted before being stretched again to launch the frog into the air. The forelegs are folded against the chest and the hind legs remain in the extended, streamlined position for the duration of the jump.<ref name=Frogjump>{{cite web |url=http://www.komverse.com/2010/05/15/how-frogs-jump-nationalgeographic/ |title=How frogs jump |author=Minott, Kevin |date=2010-05-15 |publisher=National Geographic |accessdate=2012-06-10}}</ref> In some extremely capable jumpers, such as the [[Cuban tree frog]] (''Osteopilus septentrionalis'') and the [[Northern Leopard Frog|northern leopard frog]] (''Rana pipiens''), the peak power exerted during a jump can exceed that which the muscle is theoretically capable of producing.

=== Walking and running ===
Frogs in the families Bufonidae, [[Rhinophrynidae]] and [[Microhylidae]] have short back legs and tend to walk rather than jump.<ref name=Britannica>{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/29023/Anura |title=Anura |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica Online |accessdate=2012-06-12}}</ref> When they try to move rapidly, they speed up the rate of movement of their limbs or resort to an ungainly hopping gait. The [[Gastrophryne olivacea|western narrow-mouthed toad]] (''Gastrophryne olivacea'') has been described as having a gait that is "a combination of running and short hops that are usually only an inch or two in length".<ref>{{cite journal |author=Fitch, H.

The [[Kassina maculata|red-legged running frog]] (''Kassina maculata'') has short, slim hind limbs unsuited to jumping. It can move fast by using a running gait in which the two hind legs are used alternately. Slow motion photography shows that, unlike a horse that can trot or gallop, the frog's gait remained similar at slow, medium and fast speeds.<ref>{{cite journal |author= Ahn, A.

=== Swimming ===
Frogs that live in or visit water have adaptations that improve their swimming abilities. The hind limbs are heavily muscled and strong. The webbing between the toes of the hind feet increases the area of the foot and helps propel the frog powerfully through the water. Members of the family [[Pipidae]] are wholly aquatic and show the most marked specialization. They have inflexible vertebral columns, flattened, streamlined bodies, [[lateral line]] systems, and powerful hind limbs with large webbed feet.<ref name=Pipidae>{{cite web |url=http://amphibiaweb.org/lists/Pipidae.shtml |title=Pipidae |work=AmphibiaWeb |publisher=University of California, Berkeley |accessdate=2012-06-14}}</ref> Tadpoles mostly have large tailfins which provide thrust when the tail is moved from side to side.<ref name="Duellman"/>

=== Burrowing ===
Some frogs have become adapted for burrowing and a life underground. They tend to have rounded bodies, short limbs, small heads with bulging eyes and hind feet adapted for excavation. An extreme example of this is the [[Purple frog]] (''Nasikabatrachus sahyadrensis'') from southern India which feeds on [[termite]]s and spends almost its whole life underground. It emerges briefly during the [[monsoon]] to mate and breed in temporary pools. It has a tiny head with a pointed snout and a plump rounded body. Because of this [[fossorial]] existence it was [[Species description|first described]] in 2003, being new to the scientific community at that time, although previously known to local people.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Radhakrishnan, C.; Gopi, K.

The spadefoot toads of North America are also adapted to underground life. The [[Plains Spadefoot Toad|plains spadefoot toad]] (''Spea bombifrons'') is typical and has a flap of keratinised bone attached to one of the [[Metatarsus|metatarsals]] of the hind foot which it uses to dig itself backwards into the ground. As it digs, the toad wriggles its hips from side to side in order to sink into the loose soil. It has a shallow burrow in the summer from which it emerges at night to forage. In winter it digs much deeper and has been recorded at a depth of {{convert|4.5|m}}.<ref name=Farrar>{{cite web |url=http://amphibiaweb.org/cgi-bin/amphib_query?where-genus=Spea&where-species=bombifrons |title=''Spea bombifrons''  |author=Farrar, Eugenia; Hey, Jane |work=AmphibiaWeb |publisher=University of California, Berkeley |accessdate=2012-06-16}}</ref>  The tunnel is filled with soil and the toad hibernates in a small chamber at the end. During this time, urea accumulates in its tissues and water is drawn in from the surrounding damp soil by [[osmosis]] to supply the toad's needs.<ref name=Farrar/> Spadefoot toads are "explosive breeders", all emerging from their burrows at the same time and converging on temporary pools, attracted to one of these by the calling of the first male to find a suitable breeding location.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://amphibiaweb.org/lists/Scaphiopodidae.shtml |title=Scaphiopodidae |work=AmphibiaWeb |publisher=University of California, Berkeley |accessdate=2012-06-16}}</ref>

The burrowing frogs of Australia have a rather different lifestyle. The [[Western Spotted Frog|western spotted frog]] (''Heleioporus albopunctatus'') digs a burrow beside a river or in the bed of an ephemeral stream and regularly emerges to forage. Mating takes place and eggs are laid in a foam nest inside the burrow. The eggs partially develop there but do not hatch out until they are submerged following heavy rainfall. The tadpoles then swim out into the open water and rapidly complete their development.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/9763/0 |title=''Heleioporus albopunctatus'' |author=Roberts, Dale; Hero, Jean-Marc |year=2011 |publisher=IUCN Red List of Threatened Species |accessdate=2012-06-16}}</ref> Madagascan burrowing frogs are less fossorial and mostly bury themselves in leaf litter. One of these is the [[Scaphiophryne marmorata|green burrowing frog]] (''Scaphiophryne marmorata'') which has a flattened head with a short snout and well developed metatarsal tubercles on its hind feet to help with excavation. It also has greatly enlarged terminal discs on its fore feet that help it to clamber around in bushes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.amphibian.co.uk/scaphiophryne.html |title=Madagascan Burrowing Frogs: Genus: ''Scaphiophryne'' (Boulenger, 1882) |author=Staniszewski, Marc |date=1998-09-30 |accessdate=2012-06-16}}</ref>  It breeds in temporary pools that form after rains.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Venesci, M; Raxworthy, C.

=== Climbing ===
[[File:Phyllomedusa burmeisteri01.jpg|thumb|alt=Frog climbing|[[Phyllomedusa burmeisteri|Burmeister's leaf frog]]]]
Tree frogs are found high in the [[canopy (biology)|canopy]] where they scramble around on the branches, twigs and leaves, sometimes never coming down to earth. The "true" tree frogs belong to the family Hylidae but members of other frog families have independently adopted an arboreal habit, a case of [[convergent evolution]]. These include the [[glass frogs]] (Centrolenidae), the [[Hyperoliidae|bush frogs]] (Hyperoliidae), some of the narrow-mouthed frogs (Microhylidae) and the [[Rhacophoridae|shrub frogs]] (Rhacophoridae).<ref name=Britannica/> Most tree frogs are under {{convert|10|cm|0|abbr=on}} in length, with long legs and long toes with adhesive pads on the tips. The surface of the toe pads is formed from a closely packed layer of flat-topped, hexagonal [[epidermis (skin)|epidermal]] cells separated by grooves into which glands secrete [[mucus]]. These toe pads, moistened by the mucus, provide the grip on any wet or dry surface, including glass. The forces involved include [[boundary friction]] of the toe pad epidermis on the surface and also [[surface tension]] and [[viscosity]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Federle, W.; Barnes, W. J.

=== Gliding ===
During the evolutionary history of the frog, several different groups have independently taken to the air.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Emerson, Sharon B.; Koehl,  M. A. R. |year=1990 |title=The interaction of behavioral and morphological change in the evolution of a novel locomotor type: "flying frogs |journal=Evolution |volume=44 |issue=8 |pages=1931<U+2013>1946 |jstor=2409604 |doi=10.2307/2409604 }}</ref> Some frogs in the tropical rainforest are specially adapted for gliding from tree to tree or parachuting to the forest floor. Typical of them is [[Rhacophorus nigropalmatus|Wallace's flying frog]] (''Rhacophorus nigropalmatus'') from Malaysia and Borneo. It has large feet with the fingertips expanded into flat adhesive discs and the digits fully webbed. There are flaps of skin on the lateral margins of the limbs and across the tail region. With the digits splayed, the limbs outstretched and these flaps spread, it can glide considerable distances but is unable to undertake powered flight.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://amphibiaweb.org/cgi-bin/amphib_query?query_src=aw_search_index&where-genus=Rhacophorus&where-species=nigropalmatus&rel-genus=equals&rel-species=equals |title=''Rhacophorus nigropalmatus'' |date=2001-11-29 |author=Shah, Sunny; Tiwari, Rachna |work=AmphibiaWeb |publisher=University of California, Berkeley |accessdate=2012-06-11}}</ref> It can alter its direction of travel and navigate distances of up to {{convert|15|m}} between trees.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://animals.nationalgeographic.com/animals/amphibians/wallaces-flying-frog/ |title=Wallace's Flying Frog ''Rhacophorus nigropalmatus'' |publisher=National Geographic: Animals |accessdate=2012-06-05}}</ref>

== Life history ==
Like other amphibians, the life cycle of a frog normally starts in water with an egg that hatches into a limbless larva with gills, commonly known as a [[tadpole]]. After further growth, during which it develops limbs and lungs, the tadpole undergoes [[metamorphosis]] in which its appearance and internal organs are rearranged. After this it is able to leave the water as a miniature, air-breathing frog.

=== Reproduction ===
Two main types of reproduction occur in frogs, prolonged breeding and explosive breeding. In the former, adopted by the majority of species, adult frogs  at certain times of year assemble at a pond, lake or stream to breed. Many frogs return to the bodies of water in which they developed as larvae. This often results in annual migrations involving thousands of individuals. In explosive breeders, mature adult frogs arrive at breeding sites in response to certain trigger factors such as rainfall occurring in an arid area. In these frogs, mating and spawning take place promptly and the speed of larval growth is rapid in order to make use of the ephemeral pools before they dry up.<ref name=Stebbins>{{cite book |title=A Natural History of Amphibians |last=Stebbins |first=Robert C. |coauthors=Cohen, Nathan W. |year=1995 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=0-691-03281-5 |pages=154<U+2013>162 }}</ref>

Among prolonged breeders, males usually arrive at the breeding site first and remain there for some time whereas females tend to arrive later and depart soon after they have spawned. This means that males outnumber females at the water's edge and defend territories from which they expel other males. They advertise their presence by calling, often alternating their croaks with neighbouring frogs. Larger, stronger males tend to have deeper calls and maintain higher quality territories. Females select their mates at least partly on the basis of the depth of their voice.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Davies, N. B.; Halliday, T. R. |year=1978 |title=Deep croaks and fighting assessment in toads ''Bufo bufo'' |journal=Nature |volume=274 |issue=5672 |pages=683<U+2013>685 |doi=10.1038/274683a0}}</ref>  In some species there are satellite males who have no territory and do not call. They may intercept females that are approaching a calling male or take over a vacated territory. Calling is an energy-sapping activity. Sometimes the two roles are reversed and a calling male gives up its territory and becomes a satellite.<ref name=Stebbins/>

[[File:Bufo bufo couple during migration(2005).jpg|thumb|left|Male and female [[common toad]]s (''Bufo bufo'') in [[amplexus]]]]
In explosive breeders, the first male that finds a suitable breeding location such as a temporary pool, calls loudly and other frogs of both sexes converge on the pool. Explosive breeders tend to call in unison creating a chorus that can be heard from far away. The spadefoot  toads (''[[Scaphiopus]] spp.'') of North America fall into this category. Mate selection and courtship is not as important as speed in reproduction. In some years, suitable conditions may not occur and the frogs may go for two or more years without breeding.<ref name=Stebbins/> Some female [[New Mexico Spadefoot Toad|New Mexico spadefoot toads]] (''Spea multiplicata'') only spawn half of the available eggs at a time, perhaps retaining some in case a better reproductive opportunity arises later.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Long, David R. |year=1989 |title=Energetics and reproduction in female ''Scaphiopus multiplicatus'' from Western Texas |journal=Journal of Herpetology |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=176<U+2013>179 |jstor=1564026 |doi=10.2307/1564026 }}</ref>

At the breeding site, the male mounts the female and grips her tightly round the body. Typically, amplexus takes place in the water, the female releases her eggs and the male covers them with sperm; fertilization is [[external fertilization|external]]. In many species such as the [[Great Plains toad]] (''Bufo cognatus''), the male restrains the eggs with his back feet, holding them in place for about three minutes.<ref name=Stebbins/> Members of the West African genus ''[[Nimbaphrynoides]]'' are unique among frogs in that they are [[Vivipary|viviparous]]; members of the [[Tanzania]]n genus ''[[Nectophrynoides]]'' are the only frogs known to be [[Ovoviviparity|ovoviviparous]]. In both cases, fertilization is [[Internal fertilization|internal]] and females give birth to fully developed juvenile frogs.<ref>{{cite book |title=Amphibians of East Africa |last=Channing |first=Alan |coauthors=Howell, Kim M. |year=2006 |publisher=Comstock Publishing |isbn=0-8014-4374-1 |pages=104<U+2013>117 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Sandberger, L.; Hillers, A.; Doumbia, J.; Loua, N-S.; Brede C.; R<U+00F6>del, M-O. |year=2010 |title=Rediscovery of the Liberian Nimba toad, ''Nimbaphrynoides liberiensis'' (Xavier, 1978) (Amphibia: Anura: Bufonidae), and reassessment of its taxonomic status |journal=Zootaxa |volume=4355 |pages=56<U+2013>68 |publisher=Magnolia Press | issn=1175-5334 |url=http://www.nimbadarwin.org/resources/nimbatoad.pdf }}</ref>

=== Life cycle ===

==== Eggs ====
Frogs' embryos are typically surrounded by several layers of gelatinous material. When several eggs are clumped together, they are collectively known as [[wikt:frogspawn|frogspawn]]. The jelly provides support and protection while allowing the passage of oxygen, [[carbon dioxide]] and ammonia. It absorbs moisture and swells on contact with water. After fertilization, the innermost portion liquifies to allow free movement of the developing embryo. In certain species, such as the [[Northern red-legged frog]] (''Rana aurora'') and the [[wood frog]] (''Rana sylvatica''), [[Symbiosis|symbiotic]] unicellular green algae are present in the gelatinous material. It is thought that these may benefit the developing larvae by providing them with extra oxygen through [[photosynthesis]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gilbert, Perry W. |year=1942 |title=Observations on the eggs of ''Ambystoma maculatum'' with especial reference to the green algae found within the egg envelopes |journal=Ecology |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=215<U+2013>227  |jstor=1931088 |doi=10.2307/1931088}}</ref> Most eggs are black or dark brown and this has the advantage of absorbing warmth from the sun which the insulating capsule retains. The interior of globular egg clusters of the [[Wood Frog|wood frog]] (''Rana sylvatica'') has been found to be up to 6<U+00B0>C  (11<U+00B0>F) warmer than the surrounding water and this speeds up the development of the larvae.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Waldman, Bruce; Ryan, Michael J. |year=1983 |title=Thermal advantages of communal egg mass deposition in wood frogs (''Rana sylvatica'') |journal=Journal of Herpetology |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=70<U+2013>72 |jstor=1563783 |doi=10.2307/1563783 }}</ref>

The shape and size of the egg mass is characteristic of the species. Ranids tend to produce globular clusters containing large numbers of eggs whereas bufonids produce long, cylindrical strings. The tiny [[Yellow-Striped Pygmy Eleuth|yellow-striped pygmy eleuth]] (''Eleutherodactylus limbatus'') lays eggs singly, burying them in moist soil.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Estrada, Alberto R.; Hedges, S.

==== Tadpoles ====
The larvae that emerge from the eggs, known as tadpoles (or occasionally polliwogs), typically have oval bodies and long, vertically flattened tails. As a general rule, free-living larvae are fully aquatic, but at least one species (''[[Nannophrys ceylonensis]]'') has semiterrestrial tadpoles which live among wet rocks.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Wickramasinghe, Deepthi D. ; Oseen, Kerri L.; Wassersug, Richard J. |year=2007 |title=Ontogenetic Changes in Diet and Intestinal Morphology in Semi-Terrestrial Tadpoles of ''Nannophrys ceylonensis'' (Dicroglossidae) |journal=Copeia |volume=2007 |issue=4 |pages=1012<U+2013>1018 |jstor=25140719 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://amphibiaweb.org/cgi-bin/amphib_query?query_src=aw_lists_genera_&table=amphib&where-genus=Nannophrys&where-species=ceylonensis |title=''Nannophrys ceylonensis'' |author=Janzen, Peter |date=2005-05-10 |work=AmphibiaWeb |publisher=University of California, Berkeley |accessdate=2012-07-20}}</ref> Tadpoles lack eyelids and have cartilaginous skeletons, [[lateral line system]]s, gills for respiration (external gills at first, internal gills later), and vertically flattened tails they use for swimming.<ref name="Duellman">{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/29023/Anura/40603/From-tadpole-to-adult |title=Anura: From tadpole to adult |author=Duellman, W. E.; Zug, G. R. |publisher=Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica |accessdate=2012-07-13}}</ref>

From early in its development, a gill pouch covers the tadpole's gills and front legs. The lungs soon start to develop and are used as an accessory breathing organ. Some species go through metamorphosis while still inside the egg and hatch directly into small frogs. Tadpoles lack true teeth, but the jaws in most species have two elongated, parallel rows of small, [[keratin]]ized structures called keradonts in their upper jaws. Their lower jaws usually have three rows of keradonts surrounded by a horny beak, but the number of rows can vary and the exact arrangements of mouth parts provides a means for species identification.<ref name=Stebbins2/> In the Pipidae, with the exception of ''[[Hymenochirus]]'', the tadpoles have paired anterior barbels, which make them resemble small [[catfish]].<ref name=Pipidae/> Their tails are stiffened by a [[notochord]], but does not contain any bony or cartilaginous elements except for a few vertebrae at the base which forms the urostyle during metamorphosis. This has been suggested as an adaptation to their lifestyles; because the transformation into frogs happens very fast, the tail is made of soft tissue only, as bone and cartilage take a much longer time to be broken down and absorbed. The tail fin and tip is fragile and will easily tear, which is seen as an adaptation to escape from predators which tries to grasp them by the tail.<ref>[http://intl-icb.oxfordjournals.org/content/40/1/62.full Tadpole Locomotion: Axial Movement and Tail Functions in a Largely Vertebraeless Vertebrate]</ref>

Tadpoles are typically [[herbivore|herbivorous]], feeding mostly on [[alga]]e, including [[diatom]]s filtered from the water through the [[gill]]s. Some species are carnivorous at the tadpole stage, eating insects, smaller tadpoles, and fish. The Cuban tree frog (''Osteopilus septentrionalis'') is one of a number of species in which the tadpoles can be [[Cannibalism|cannibalistic]]. Tadpoles that develop legs early may be eaten by the others, so late developers may have better long-term survival prospects.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Crump, Martha L. |year=1986 |title=Cannibalism by younger tadpoles: another hazard of metamorphosis |journal=Copeia |volume=4 |issue=4 |pages=1007<U+2013>1009 |publisher=American Society of Ichthyologists and Herpetologists |jstor=1445301 |doi=10.2307/1445301}}</ref>

Tadpoles are highly vulnerable to being eaten by fish, [[newt]]s, predatory [[diving beetle]]s, and birds, such as [[kingfisher]]s. Some tadpoles, including those of the [[cane toad]] (''Bufo marinus''), are poisonous. The tadpole stage may be as short as a week in explosive breeders or it may last through one or more winters followed by metamorphosis in the spring.<ref>{{cite book |title=A Natural History of Amphibians |last=Stebbins |first=Robert C. |coauthors=Cohen, Nathan W. |year=1995 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=0-691-03281-5 |pages=173<U+2013>175 }}</ref>

==== Metamorphosis ====
At the end of the tadpole stage, a frog undergoes metamorphosis in which its body makes a sudden transition into the adult form. This metamorphosis typically lasts only 24 hours, and is initiated by production of the [[hormone]] [[thyroxine]]. This causes different tissues to develop in different ways. The principal changes that take place include the development of the lungs and the disappearance of the gills and gill pouch, making the front legs visible. The lower jaw transforms into the big mandible of the carnivorous adult, and the long, spiral gut of the herbivorous tadpole is replaced by the typical short gut of a predator.<ref name=Stebbins2/> The nervous system becomes adapted for hearing and stereoscopic vision, and for new methods of locomotion and feeding.<ref name=Stebbins2/> The eyes are repositioned higher up on the head and the eyelids and associated glands are formed. The eardrum, middle ear, and inner ear are developed. The skin becomes thicker and tougher, the lateral line system is lost, and skin glands are developed.<ref name=Stebbins2/>  The final stage is the disappearance of the tail, but this takes place rather later, the tissue being used to produce a spurt of growth in the limbs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/25677/animal-development/63769/Metamorphosis |title=Animal development: Metamorphosis |author=Balinsky, Boris Ivan  |work=Encyclopedia Britannica |accessdate=2012-08-10}}</ref> Frogs are at their most vulnerable to predators when they are undergoing metamorphosis.

After metamorphosis, young adults may disperse into terrestrial habitats or continue to live in water. Almost all species of frogs are [[carnivore|carnivorous]] as adults, preying on invertebrates, including [[arthropod]]s, [[annelid|worms]], [[gastropoda|snails]], and [[slug]]s. A few of the larger ones may eat other frogs, small [[mammal]]s, and [[fish]]. Some frogs use their sticky tongues to catch fast-moving prey, while others push food into their mouths with their hands. The tree frog ''[[Xenohyla truncata]]'' is a partly herbivorous exception, its diet including a large proportion of fruit.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Da Silva, H. R.; De Britto-Pereira, X.

[[File:TrophicWeb.jpg|thumb|left|A trophic pyramid showing frogs as primary predators]]
Frogs are primary predators and an important part of the [[food web]]. Being [[cold-blooded]], they make efficient use of the food they eat with little energy being used for metabolic processes, while the rest is transformed into [[biomass (ecology)|biomass]]. They are themselves eaten by secondary predators and are the primary terrestrial consumers of invertebrates, most of which feed on plants. By reducing herbivory, they play a part in increasing the growth of plants and are thus part of a delicately balanced ecosystem.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Pimm, Stuart L. |year=1979 |title=The structure of food webs |journal=Theoretical Population Biology |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=144<U+2013>158 |url=http://www.nicholas.duke.edu/people/faculty/pimm/publications/pimmreprints/12_Pimm_TPB_1979.pdf |doi=10.1016/0040-5809(79)90010-8 |pmid=538731}}</ref>

Little is known about the longevity of frogs and toads in the wild, but some can live for many years. [[Skeletochronology]] is a method of examining bones to determine age. Using this method, the ages of [[mountain yellow-legged frog]]s (''Rana muscosa'') were studied, the phalanges of the toes showing seasonal lines where growth slows in winter. The oldest frogs had ten bands, so their age was believed to be 14 years, including the four-year tadpole stage.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Matthews, K.

In small pools, predators are mostly absent and  competition between tadpoles becomes the variable that constrains their survival. Certain frog species avoid this competition by making use of smaller [[phytotelma]]ta (water-filled leaf [[wikt:axil|axils]] or small woody cavities) as sites for depositing a few tadpoles.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1420-9101.2008.01609.x | last1 = Brown | first1 = J.

The male frog guards them from predation and carries water in his cloaca to keep them moist. When they hatch, the female moves the tadpoles on her back to a water-holding [[bromeliad]] or other similar water body, depositing just one in each location.

Many other diverse forms of parental care are seen in frogs. The tiny male ''[[Colostethus subpunctatus]]'' stands guard over his egg cluster, laid under a stone or log. When the eggs hatch, he transports the tadpoles on his back to a temporary pool, where he partially immerses himself in the water and one or more tadpoles drop off. He then moves on to another pool.<ref>{{cite journal |author= Fandi<U+00F1>o, Mar<U+00ED>a Claudia; L<U+00FC>ddecke, Horst; Am<U+00E9>zquita, Adolfo |year=1997 |title=Vocalisation and larval transportation of male ''Colostethus subpunctatus'' (Anura: Dendrobatidae)  |journal=Amphibia-Reptilia |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=39<U+2013>48 |doi=10.1163/156853897X00297 }}</ref> The male [[common midwife toad]] (''Alytes obstetricans'') carries the eggs around with him attached to his hind legs.

Some frogs protect their offspring inside their own bodies. Both male and female [[pouched frog]]s (''Assa darlingtoni'') guard their eggs, which are laid on the ground. When the eggs hatch, the male lubricates his body with the jelly surrounding them and immerses himself in the egg mass. The tadpoles wriggle into skin pouches on his side, where they develop until they metamorphose into juvenile frogs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://frogs.org.au/frogs/species/Assa/darlingtoni/ |title=''Assa darlingtoni'' |year=2005 |work=Frogs Australia Network |accessdate=2012-08-05}}</ref> The female [[gastric-brooding frog]] (''Rheobatrachus'' sp.) from [[Australia]], now probably extinct, swallows her fertilized eggs, which then develop inside her stomach. She ceases to feed and stops secreting [[stomach acid]]. The tadpoles rely on the yolks of the eggs for nourishment. After six or seven weeks, they are ready for metamorphosis. The mother regurgitates the tiny frogs, which hop away from her mouth.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Rheobatrachus_silus.html |title=''Rheobatrachus silus'' |author=Semeyn, E. |year=2002 |work=Animal Diversity Web |publisher=University of Michigan Museum of Zoology |accessdate=2012-08-05}}</ref> The female [[Darwin's frog]] (''Rhinoderma darwinii'') from [[Chile]] lays up to 40 eggs on the ground, where they are guarded by the male.

== Defence ==
[[File:R. imitator Chazuta.jpg|thumb|The mildly toxic ''[[Ranitomeya imitator]]'']]
[[File:Dendrobates pumilio.jpg|thumb|[[Strawberry poison-dart frog]] contains numerous alkaloids which deter predators]]
At first sight, frogs seem rather defenceless because of their small size, slow movement, thin skin, and lack of defensive structures, such as spines, claws or teeth. Many use camouflage to avoid detection, the skin often being spotted or streaked in neutral colours that allow a stationary frog to merge into its surroundings. Some can make prodigious leaps, often into water, that help them to evade potential attackers, while many have other defensive adaptations and strategies.<ref name=Stebbins/>

The skin of many frogs contains mild toxic substances called [[bufotoxin]]s to make them unpalatable to potential predators. Most toads and some frogs have large poison glands, the [[parotoid gland]]s, located on the sides of their heads behind the eyes and other glands elsewhere on their bodies. These glands secrete mucus and a range of toxins that make frogs slippery to hold and distasteful or poisonous. If the noxious effect is immediate, the predator may cease its action and the frog may escape. If the effect develops more slowly, the predator may learn to avoid that species in future.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Barthalmus, George T.; Zielinski, William J. |year=1988 |title=''Xenopus'' skin mucus induces oral dyskinesias that promote escape from snakes |journal=Pharmacology Biochemistry and Behavior |volume=30 |issue=4 |pages=957<U+2013>959 |doi=10.1016/0091-3057(88)90126-8 |pmid=3227042}}</ref> Poisonous frogs tend to advertise their toxicity with bright colours, an adaptive strategy known as [[aposematism]].

[[File:Deformed Frog.gif|left|thumb|Deformed frog]]
[[Frog mutations and genetic defects]] have increased since the 1990s. These often include missing legs or extra legs. Various causes have been identified or hypothesized, including an increase in [[Ultraviolet|ultraviolet radiation]] affecting the spawn on the surface of ponds, chemical contamination from pesticides and fertilizers, and parasites such as the [[trematode]] ''[[Ribeiroia ondatrae]]''. Probably all these are involved in a complex way as [[stressor]]s, environmental factors contributing to rates of disease, and vulnerability to attack by parasites. Malformations impair mobility and the individuals may not survive to adulthood. An increase in the number of frogs eaten by birds may actually increase the likelihood of parasitism of other frogs, because the trematode's complex lifecycle includes the [[Planorbidae|ramshorn snail]] and several intermediate hosts such as birds.<ref name=Blaustein>{{cite journal |author=Blaustein, Andrew R.; Johnson, Pieter T.

The [[cane toad]] (''Bufo marinus'') is a very adaptable species native to South and Central America. In the 1930s, it was introduced into Puerto Rico, and later various other islands in the Pacific and Caribbean region, as a [[biological pest control]] agent.<ref>{{cite book | last=Tyler | first=Michael J. | year=1989 | title=Australian Frogs | publisher=Penguin Books | page=111 | isbn=0-670-90123-7 }}</ref> In 1935, 3000 toads were liberated in the [[sugar cane]] fields of Queensland, Australia, in an attempt to control [[cane beetle]]s such as ''Dermolepida albohirtum'', the larvae of which damage and kill the canes. Initial results in many of these countries were positive, but it later became apparent that the toads upset the ecological balance in their new environments. They bred freely, competed with native species of frogs, ate bees and other harmless native invertebrates, had few predators in their adopted habitats, and poisoned pets, carnivorous birds, and mammals. In many of these countries, they are now regarded both as pests and [[invasive species]], and scientists are looking for a biological method to control them.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://australianmuseum.net.au/Cane-Toad |title=Cane toad |author=Cameron, Elizabeth |date=2012-09-06 |publisher=Australian Museum |accessdate=2012-09-12}}</ref>

[[Frog legs]] are eaten by humans in many parts of the world. Originally, they were supplied from local wild populations, but overexploitation led to a diminution in the supply.

Frogs are sometimes used for [[dissection]]s in high school and university anatomy classes, often first being injected with coloured substances to enhance the contrast between the [[biological system]]s. This practice is declining with increasing concerns about [[animal welfare]], and "digital frogs" are now available for virtual dissection.<ref>{{cite news |title=California Schools Leading Race to Stop Dissections |author= |url=http://awionline.org/content/california-schools-leading-race-stop-dissections |newspaper=Animal Welfare Institute |date=2011-04-25 |accessdate=2012-06-17}}</ref>

Frogs have served as [[Animal testing|experimental animals]] throughout the history of science.

Frogs are used in cloning research and other branches of [[embryology]].  Although alternative pregnancy assays have been developed, biologists continue to use ''Xenopus'' as a [[model organism]] in [[developmental biology]] because their embryos are large and easy to manipulate, they are readily obtainable, and can easily be kept in the laboratory.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://people.ucalgary.ca/~browder/frogsrus.html |title=''Xenopus'' as a Model System in Developmental Biology |author=Browder, L.; Iten, L.

Because frog toxins are extraordinarily diverse, they have raised the interest of biochemists as a "natural pharmacy". The alkaloid [[epibatidine]], a painkiller 200 times more potent than [[morphine]], is found in some species of poison dart frogs. Other chemicals isolated from the skins of frogs may offer resistance to [[HIV]] infection.<ref>{{cite journal |last=VanCompernolle | first=S. E.| coauthors=Taylor, R.

It has long been suspected that pre-Columbian [[Mesoamerica]]ns used a toxic secretion produced by the cane toad as a [[hallucinogen]], but more likely they used substances secreted by the [[Colorado River toad]] (''Bufo alvarius''). These contain [[bufotenin]] (5-MeO-DMT), a [[psychoactive drug|psychoactive compound]] that has been used in modern times as a [[recreational drug]].

[[File:Schrecklicherpfeilgiftfrosch-01.jpg|thumb|left|[[Golden poison frog]] (''Phyllobates terribilis'')]]
Exudations from the skin of the [[golden poison frog]] (''Phyllobates terribilis'') are traditionally used by native Colombians to poison the darts they use for hunting. The tip of the projectile is rubbed over the back of the frog and the dart is launched from a [[blowgun]]. The combination of the two alkaloid toxins [[batrachotoxin]] and [[homobatrachotoxin]] is so powerful, one frog contains enough poison to kill an estimated 22,000 mice.<ref name=dartpoison>{{cite journal |author=Myers, Charles W.; Daly, John W.; Malkin, Borys |year=1978 |title=A dangerously toxic new frog (''Phyllobates'') used by Ember<U+00E1> Indians of western Colombia, with discussion of blowgun fabrication and dart poisoning |journal=Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History |volume=161 |pages=307<U+2013>366 |url=http://digitallibrary.amnh.org/dspace/handle/2246/1286 }} {{open access}}</ref>  Two other species, the [[Kokoe poison dart frog]] (''Phyllobates aurotaenia'') and the [[black-legged dart frog]] (''Phyllobates bicolor'') are also used for this purpose. These are less toxic and less abundant than the golden poison frog. They are impaled on pointed sticks and may be heated over a fire to maximise the quantity of poison that can be transferred to the dart.<ref name=dartpoison/>

{{details|Frogs in popular culture}}
[[File:Frog1larcomuseum.jpg|thumb|[[Moche (culture)|Moche]] frog, 200 AD, [[Larco Museum|Larco Museum Collection]], Lima, Peru]]
Frogs feature prominently in [[folklore]], [[fairy tale]]s, and popular culture. They tend to be portrayed as benign, ugly, and clumsy, but with hidden talents. Examples include [[Michigan J. Frog]], [[The Frog Prince (story)|"The Frog Prince"]], and [[Kermit the Frog]]. The [[Warner Brothers]] cartoon ''[[One Froggy Evening]]'' features Michigan J. Frog, that will only dance and sing for the demolition worker who opens his time capsule, but will not perform in public.<ref>{{cite news |title=Chuck Jones: Three Cartoons (1953<U+2013>1957) |author=Ebert, Roger |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060115/REVIEWS08/601150301/1023 |newspaper=Chicago Sun-Times |date=2006-01-15 |accessdate=2012-06-30}}</ref> "The Frog Prince" is a fairy tale about a frog that turns into a handsome prince after he has rescued a princess's golden ball and she has taken him into her palace.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eastoftheweb.com/short-stories/UBooks/FrogPrin.shtml |title=The Frog Prince |author=Brothers Grimm |publisher=East of the Web |accessdate=2012-06-30}}</ref> Kermit the Frog is a conscientious and disciplined character from ''[[The Muppet Show]]'' and ''[[Sesame Street]]''; while openly friendly and greatly talented, he is often portrayed as cringing at the fanciful behavior of more flamboyant characters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.walkoffame.com/kermit-the-frog |title=Walk of Fame, Kermit the Frog awarded with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, December 1, 2002 |publisher=Walkoffame.com |accessdate=2012-06-30}}</ref>

Toads have a more sinister reputation. It was believed in European folklore that they were associated with [[witch]]es as their [[familiar spirit]]s and had magical powers. The toxic secretions from their skin was used in brewing evil potions, but was also put to use to create magical cures for human and livestock ailments. They were associated with the devil; in [[John Milton]]'s ''[[Paradise Lost]]'', [[Satan]] was depicted as a toad pouring poison into [[Eve]]'s ear.<ref>{{cite book |title=Witch Hunts in Europe and America: An Encyclopedia |last=Burns |first=William E. |year=2003 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |isbn=0-313-32142-6 |page=7 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=Qr6_q-chR6MC&pg=PA7&lpg=PA7&dq=common+toad+witchcraft#v=onepage&q=common%20toad%20witchcraft&f=false }}</ref>

Some believed when one of these frogs died, it would turn into a golden [[talisman]] known as a ''[[huaca]]''. Today, despite being extinct in the wild, Panamanian golden frogs remain an important cultural symbol and can be found on decorative cloth [[Mola (art form)|''molas'']] made by the [[Kuna people]]. They also appear  as part of the inlaid design on a new overpass in [[Panama City]], on T-shirts, and even on [[lottery ticket]]s.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Gratwicke | first1= B. |year= 2009 |title=The Panamanian Golden Frog | work=Panama Amphibian Rescue and Conservation Project | url=http://amphibianrescue.org/2009/09/17/brian-gratwicke-the-panamanian-golden-frog/}}</ref>
