==History==

Sound Of Gospel Records was founded in [[Detroit, MI|Detroit]], [[Michigan]] in 1969 by [[Armen Boladian]]. 
A few years later after it was established.

It is a gospel subsidiary record label of Westbound Records, where Boladian was also its former president.

His extended foray into gospel music is given a brief footnote in the story, and Sound of Gospel is not even mentioned by name, but it should have been. Many great artists, including the Clark Sisters, Mattie Moss Clark, Voices of Tabernacle, Jerry Q. Parries, Thomas Whitfield, the St. James Choir and others have had Sound of Gospel releases.

Sound Of Gospel had signed up well known gospel music acts like Mattie Moss
Clark, The Clark Sisters, Yolanda Adams, the late Thomas Whitfield, and the Late Rev. James Moore.

Throughout its history, Sound Of Gospel had added a lot of other artists like Esther Smith, the Youth IV Christ Fellowship Mass Choir, etc.

Well known Pastor and Church Organist, the late Rev. Charles Nicks, Jr. along with the St. James Adult Choir also had signed up with the label, and had released a few albums like "HOLD BACK THE NIGHT", and more.

From its humble beginnings up until now, it was and is still one of the major Gospel Record Labels which may continue to stand through the test of time through their continuous goal of releasing Gospel Music for all the world to hear.
