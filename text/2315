'''"Casual Friday"''' is the twenty-fourth episode of the [[The Office (US TV series) season 5|fifth season]] of the television series ''[[The Office (U.S. TV series)|The Office]]'', and the 98th overall episode of the series. It originally aired on [[NBC]] in the United States on April 30, 2009. In the episode, [[Michael Scott (The Office)|Michael]], [[Pam Beesly|Pam]] and [[Ryan Howard (The Office)|Ryan]] return to [[Dunder Mifflin]], but have trouble readjusting to the rest of the sales desk, prompting [[Dwight Schrute|Dwight]], [[Andy Bernard|Andy]], [[Phyllis Vance|Phyllis]] and [[Stanley Hudson|Stanley]] to consider a mutiny. [[Jim Halpert|Jim]] and [[Creed Bratton (character)|Creed]] play board games until the situation blows over, and [[Toby Flenderson|Toby]] struggles to deal with employee complaints brought about by the [[Casual Friday]] attire.

The episode was written by [[Anthony Q. Farrell]] and directed by [[Brent Forrester]]. The episode received generally positive reviews, with several commentators expressing relief that the series appeared to remain fresh following the six-episode "Michael Scott Paper Company" story arc, which had ended in the previous episode, "[[Broke (The Office)|Broke]]". According to [[Nielsen Ratings]], "Casual Friday" was watched by 7.3 million households during its original broadcast, marking the lowest original episode rating of the fifth season until the May 14 season finale, "[[Company Picnic]]".

==Synopsis==
[[Michael Scott (The Office)|Michael]] ([[Steve Carell]]) has returned to his old job as regional manager of the [[Dunder Mifflin]] [[Scranton]] branch and announces that [[Pam Beesly|Pam]] ([[Jenna Fischer]]) and [[Ryan Howard (The Office)|Ryan]] ([[B.J. Novak]]) have joined the sales team, retaining their old clients from the Michael Scott Paper Company. [[Dwight Schrute|Dwight]] ([[Rain Wilson]]), [[Andy Bernard|Andy]] ([[Ed Helms]]), [[Phyllis Vance|Phyllis]] ([[Phyllis Smith]]) and [[Stanley Hudson|Stanley]] ([[Leslie David Baker]]) are upset because most of those clients were ones Michael previously stole from them. They are also upset that Michael treats Pam and Ryan with more respect because they followed him to his new company while the rest of the sales staff stayed behind. Dwight calls a secret meeting in the warehouse with the salespeople, minus Pam and Ryan, to think of a way to get their clients back.

[[Jim Halpert|Jim]] ([[John Krasinski]]), trying to remain impartial, informs Michael of the potential mutiny and heads to the break room to play board games with [[Creed Bratton (character)|Creed]] ([[Creed Bratton]]) until the conflict is resolved. Things take a turn for the worse when Dwight interrupts a sales call with Ryan, causing him to lose the client. Michael steps in and demands an apology, but Dwight, Andy, Phyllis and Stanley threaten to quit and start their own paper company. When Michael calls their bluff, Phyllis breaks down and says that they were the real victims of Michael's company, not corporate, and that they were hurt since Michael had treated them like a family and then turned on them. Michael is taken aback by her words.

Meanwhile, it is [[Casual Friday]] and most people dress too loosely at the office. [[Angela Martin|Angela]] ([[Angela Kinsey]]) complains to [[Toby Flenderson|Toby]] ([[Paul Lieberstein]]) about [[Oscar Martinez|Oscar]] ([[Oscar Nunez]]) wearing sandals to work and having to look at his feet. [[Meredith Palmer|Meredith]] ([[Kate Flannery]]) disgusts the rest of the employees by wearing a very short dress without any panties or a bra, thus exposing herself to the rest of the office as she tries to adjust it to meet Toby's requests. Toby calls a meeting with everyone regarding Casual Friday. When Dwight tries to take charge of the meeting, Toby is finally stern with him and cancels Casual Friday, much to everyone's disappointment.

Michael calls a meeting with Dwight, Andy, Phyllis and Stanley to give them a formal apology, but they do not accept it since all they want is their clients back. Michael reluctantly agrees to give back their clients. In doing so, however, there are not enough clients to keep both Pam and Ryan on the sales team, leaving Michael to decide which one to keep. He talks it over with Jim, who suggests Pam would be better suited, while Michael thinks Ryan should get it. Michael calls a meeting with Pam after meeting with Ryan to inform her she did not get the sales job. Pam is visibly disappointed, but Michael starts laughing and tells her that she did get it, having offered Ryan a temp position again. Pam laughs it off and tells him he should stop with the "fake-firing" joke. Michael then decides to pull the joke on the new receptionist, [[List_of_characters_from_The_Office_(U.S._TV_series)#Kelly_.22Erin.22_Hannon|Erin]] ([[Ellie Kemper]]).

==Production==
"Casual Friday" was written by [[Anthony Q. Farrell]] and directed by [[Brent Forrester]]. The official website for ''The Office'' included two cut scenes from "Casual Friday" within a week of its original release. In the first 50-second clip, Jim welcomes Pam to her new sales desk with a gift of a model of an island with figures representing Jim, Pam and Dwight, who share the office pod together. Dwight insists he did not have anything to do with the gift and does not welcome Pam to the desk because she "obscures my view of the shredder."<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Office - Casual Friday - Clip One - Video |work=[[NBC]] |date=2009-05-01 |url=http://www.nbc.com/The_Office/video/clips/casual-friday-clip-one/1094184/ |accessdate=2009-05-07}}</ref> In the second 50-second clip, Dwight tells Andy, Stanley and Phyllis that they should "put our balls in the guillotine, as they say," by threatening to quit if Michael does not give their clients back. The others express doubt and wonder if they should keep quiet in order to protect their jobs.<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Office - Casual Friday - Clip Two - Video |work=[[NBC]] |date=2009-05-02 |url=http://www.nbc.com/The_Office/video/clips/casual-friday-clip-two/1094214/ |accessdate=2009-05-07}}</ref>

"Casual Friday" included several callbacks to previous episodes. The scene in which Michael pretends to fire Pam, and she tells him, "Maybe you shouldn't fake fire people anymore," is a reference to [[Pilot (The Office)|the first episode]] of ''The Office'', in which Michael pretends to fire Pam as a prank and she becomes very upset, which he then does exactly to Erin.<ref name="Sepinwall">{{Cite news |last=Sepinwall |first=Alan |title=The Office, "Casual Friday": The return of Michael Scott |work=[[The Star-Ledger]] |date=2009-05-01 |url=http://www.nj.com/entertainment/tv/index.ssf/2009/05/the_office_casual_friday_the_r.html |accessdate=2009-05-01}}</ref> Michael compares the difficult choice of choosing between renting the movies ''[[The Devil Wears Prada (film)|The Devil Wears Prada]]'' and ''[[Sophie's Choice (film)|Sophie's Choice]]'', both of which star [[Meryl Streep]].<ref name="AVClub" /> The reference to the former film is a callback to the [[cold open]] to [[The Office (US TV series) season 4|fourth season]] episode, "[[Money (The Office)|Money]]", in which Michael discusses having watched the movie recently and acts rudely toward Pam in the same fashion as [[Miranda Priestly]], the film's antagonist, who is played by Streep.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Money |episodelink= Money (The Office) |series=The Office |serieslink=The Office (U.S. TV series) |network=[[NBC]] |airdate=2007-10-18 |season=4 |number=4}}</ref>  When Dwight is writing the secret messages, he uses Ryan's coffee mug, that Kelly gave to him from the "[[Customer Survey]]" episode, to hold the urine.
