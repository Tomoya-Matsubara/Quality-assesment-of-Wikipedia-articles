'''Hurricane Kate''' was the final in a series of [[tropical cyclones]] to impact the United States during 1985 and the latest in any calendar year to [[Landfall (meteorology)|strike]] the country at hurricane intensity on record. The eleventh [[tropical cyclone naming|named storm]], seventh hurricane, and third major hurricane of the [[1985 Atlantic hurricane season|annual hurricane season]],{{#tag:ref|A major hurricane is a storm that ranks as Category&nbsp;3 or higher on the [[Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale]].<ref name="gloss"/>|group="nb"}} Kate originated from the interaction of an upper-level [[Trough (meteorology)|trough]] and [[tropical wave]] northeast of [[Puerto Rico]] on November&nbsp;15. Though the system tracked erratically during the first hours of its existence, the intensification of a region of [[High-pressure area|high pressure]] to the cyclone's north caused Kate to turn westward. A favorable atmospheric pattern allowed the newly developed system to intensify to hurricane intensity on November&nbsp;16, and further to [[Saffir<U+2013>Simpson hurricane wind scale|Category&nbsp;2]] intensity three days later. Kate made its first landfall on the northern coast of [[Cuba]] at this intensity prior to emerging as a slightly weaker storm during the evening hours of November&nbsp;19. Once clear of land, it began to strengthen quickly, becoming a Category&nbsp;3 and reaching its peak intensity of 120&nbsp;mph (195&nbsp;km/h) the following day. On November&nbsp;21, a [[cold front]] moving across the [[Mississippi Valley]] resulted in a north and eventual northeast turn of the cyclone, and Kate came ashore near [[Mexico Beach, Florida]], as a minimal Category&nbsp;2 hurricane with winds of 100&nbsp;mph (160&nbsp;km/h). Gradual weakening ensued as the cyclone moved along the [[Southeast United States]] coastline, and Kate transitioned to an [[Extratropical transition#extratropical cyclone|extratropical cyclone]] on November&nbsp;23, a day after exiting the coastline of North Carolina.

The threat of Hurricane Kate in Cuba prompted the evacuation of 360,000&nbsp;people. Heavy rainfall in Cuba caused numerous mudslides and flooding, killing 10&nbsp;people and leading to severe agriculture damage. Wind gusts over hurricane intensity resulted in widespread power outages, significant building damage, and major crop damage. Damage totaled roughly $400&nbsp;million,{{#tag:ref|All damage totals are in 1985 [[United States dollar]]s.|group="nb"}} making it the most damaging hurricane to strike the island in many decades. In preparation of the system, many hurricane watches and warnings were put into effect. Hundreds of thousands of residents were evacuated, and the governor of Florida declared a state of emergency for six counties in Florida; this was later relinquished following the relatively minor impacts of Kate. In addition, many shelters were opened. When Kate struck the [[Florida Panhandle]], it became the first hurricane to make landfall in that location since [[Hurricane Eloise]] in 1975. Storm surge and flooding rains destroyed much of the oyster industry, causing many people to lose their jobs in the weeks after the storm. Gusts over 100&nbsp;mph (160&nbsp;km/h) contributed to downed trees and building damage, while a combination of the wind and rain led to downed power poles. Across the remainder of the Southeast United States, several inches of rainfall led to flash flooding, damage to roadways, and major tree damage. Overall, Kate resulted in 15&nbsp;fatalities and $700&nbsp;million in damage.

==Meteorological history==
{{storm path|Kate 1985 track.png}}
Before the formation of Hurricane Kate, a [[ridge (meteorology)|ridge]] was located across the southeastern United States for much of the autumn of 1985; concurrently, a major [[trough (meteorology)|trough]] persisted across the western portion of the country. As a result, weather conditions across the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and western Atlantic Ocean in November were more typical of the pattern in late September, including [[sea surface temperature]]s of 81&nbsp;<U+00B0>F (27&nbsp;<U+00B0>C). On November&nbsp;13, a weak [[tropical wave]]{{#tag:ref|A tropical wave is an inverted [[trough (meteorology)|trough]] of low pressure that moves along the [[trade wind]]s.<ref name="gloss">{{cite report|date=2012-03-30|title=Glossary of NHC Terms|publisher=[[National Hurricane Center]]|accessdate=2012-05-01|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/aboutgloss.shtml}}</ref>|group="nb"}} began interacting with a trough to the northeast of the [[Lesser Antilles]]. It gradually organized due to the favorable conditions, and on November&nbsp;15, a [[Hurricane Hunters]] flight into the area indicated the [[tropical cyclogenesis|development]] of a [[tropical cyclone]]. As gale force winds were already present, the system was immediately declared Tropical Storm Kate, about 240&nbsp;miles (385&nbsp;km) northeast of [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]].<ref name="tcr1">{{cite report|author=Robert A.

With a ridge to its north, Kate tracked westward after developing, and an [[cold-core low|upper-level low]] developed to the southwest of the storm. The combination of the two provided favorable [[outflow (meteorology)|outflow]], allowing Kate to quickly intensify. On November&nbsp;16, the storm attained hurricane status while moving through the southeastern [[Bahamas]].<ref name="tcr1"/> After continued strengthening, Kate made [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] at 0600&nbsp;UTC on November&nbsp;19 over north-central Cuba with a well-defined [[eye (cyclone)|eye]].<ref name="tcr2">{{cite report|author=Robert A.

Until 2011, Kate's was considered the second-latest ''hurricane'' landfall in the United States, behind only a [[1925 Florida tropical storm|cyclone in 1925]] that struck on December&nbsp;1; however, a systematic [[Atlantic hurricane reanalysis|reanalysis]] indicated the 1925 system was only a tropical storm.
