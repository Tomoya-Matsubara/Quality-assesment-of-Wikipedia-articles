'''Mariah Carey''' (born [[March 27]] [[1970]]) is an [[United States|American]] [[hip hop]],  [[pop music|pop]] and [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] [[singer-songwriter]], [[record producer]], and [[actor|actress]].<!--STOP! Do not separate this sentence from the rest of the paragraph. There is absolutely no reason to do so, and it makes the lead disjointed.--> She made her recording debut in 1990 under the guidance of [[Columbia Records]] executive [[Tommy Mottola]], and became the first recording artist to have her first five singles top the U.S. [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart. Following her marriage to Mottola in 1993, a series of hit records established her position as Columbia's highest-selling act. According to ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine, she was the most successful artist of the 1990s in the United States.<ref>Shapiro, Marc. ''Mariah Carey'' (2001). pg. 145. UK: ECW Press, Canada. ISBN 1-55022-444-1.</ref>

Following her separation from Mottola in 1997 Carey introduced elements of [[hip hop music|hip hop]] into her album work. Her popularity was in decline when she left Columbia in 2001, and she was dropped by [[Virgin Records]] the following year after a highly publicized physical and emotional breakdown, as well as the poor reception given to ''[[Glitter (film)|Glitter]]'', her film and soundtrack project. In 2002, Carey signed with [[Island Records]], and after a relatively unsuccessful period, she returned to the forefront of pop music in 2005.<ref>Lamb, Bill.

== Life and music career ==

=== Childhood and youth ===

Carey was born in [[Huntington, New York|Huntington]], [[Long Island]], [[New York]]. She is the third and youngest child of Patricia Hickey, a former opera singer and vocal coach of [[Irish people|Irish]] descent, and Alfred Roy Carey, an aeronautical engineer of [[Afro-Venezuelan]] descent.<ref>Shapiro, pg. 16.</ref><ref>[http://racerelations.about.com/od/skillsbuildingresources/g/mulattodef.htm "Mulatto - An Invisible American Identity"]. racerelations.about.com. Retrieved [[April 3]] [[2008]].</ref> Carey's parents divorced when she was three years old.<ref>Shapiro, pg. 19&ndash;20.</ref> After the divorce, Carey had little contact with her father, while her mother worked several jobs to support the family. She spent much of her time at home alone, and turned to music as an outlet. Carey was long uncomfortable with her [[biracial]] heritage, only to realize years later, after gaining her fame, that she could be a role model for biracial teens.<ref>[http://www2.oprah.com/tows/pastshows/tows_1999/tows_past_19991227.jhtml/ The Oprah Winfrey Show : Mariah Carey Talks To Biracial Teens]. oprah.com. Retrieved [[April 4]] [[2008]].</ref> She began singing at around the age of three, when her mother began to teach her after Carey imitated her mother practicing [[Verdi]]'s opera ''[[Rigoletto]]'' in Italian.<ref>Shapiro, pg. 18&ndash;19.</ref>

She graduated from [[Harborfields High School]] in [[Greenlawn, New York]]. She was frequently absent due to her work as a [[demo (music)|demo]] singer for local recording studios; her classmates consequently gave her the nickname "[[wiktionary:mirage|Mirage]]".<ref>Shapiro, pg. 31.</ref> Her work in the Long Island music scene gave her opportunities to work with musicians such as [[Gavin Christopher]] and [[Ben Margulies]], with whom she co-wrote material for her demo tape. After moving to New York City, Carey worked part-time jobs to pay the rent and completed five hundred hours of beauty school.<ref>Handelman, David. "Miss Mariah". ''[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]''. December 1997.</ref> Eventually, she became a backup singer for [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] [[freestyle music|freestyle]] singer [[Brenda K. Starr]].

In 1988, Carey met Columbia Records executive [[Tommy Mottola]] at a party, where Starr gave him Carey's demo tape. Mottola played the tape when leaving the party and was impressed. He returned to find Carey, but she had left. Nevertheless, Mottola tracked her down and signed her to a recording contract. This [[Cinderella]]-like story became part of the standard publicity surrounding Carey's entrance into the industry.<ref name="Vibe-Apr1996">Gardner, Elysa. "Cinderella Story". ''[[VIBE]]''. April 1996.</ref>

=== 1990&ndash;1992: Early commercial success ===

Carey co-wrote the tracks on her 1990  [[debut album]] ''[[Mariah Carey (album)|Mariah Carey]]'', and she has continued to co-write the majority of her material since. During the recording, she expressed dissatisfaction with the contributions of producers such as [[Ric Wake]] and [[Rhett Lawrence]], whom the executives at Columbia had enlisted to help make the album more commercially viable.<ref>Shapiro, pg. 47, 60.</ref> Backed by a substantial promotional budget, the album reached number one on the U.S. [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart, where it remained for several weeks. It yielded four number-one singles, and made Carey a star in the United States, but was less successful in other countries. Critics rated the album highly, and Carey won [[Grammy Award|Grammys]] for [[Best New Artist]], and [[Best Female Pop Vocal Performance]]&mdash;for her debut single, "[[Vision of Love]]".

Carey conceived ''[[Emotions (album)|Emotions]]'', her second album, as a homage to [[Motown]] [[soul music]] (see [[Motown Sound]]), and she worked with [[Walter Afanasieff]] and [[Robert Clivill<U+00E9>s|Clivill<U+00E9>s]] & [[David B. Cole|Cole]] (from the [[dance music|dance]] group [[C&C Music Factory]]) on the record.{{Fact|date=February 2008}} It was released soon after her debut album&mdash;in late 1991&mdash;but was neither critically nor commercially as successful; ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' described it as "more of the same, with less interesting material [...] pop-psych love songs played with airless, intimidating expertise".<ref>Evans, Paul. ''The Rolling Stone Album Guide'' (1992). pg. 110&ndash;111. UK: Virgin Books. ISBN 0-86369-643-0.</ref> The title track "[[Emotions (song)|Emotions]]" made Carey the only recording act to have their first five singles reach number one on the U.S. [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] chart, though the album's follow-up singles failed to match this feat. Carey had been lobbying to produce her own songs, and beginning with ''Emotions'', she has co-produced most of her material. "I didn't want [''Emotions''] to be somebody else's vision of me", she said. "There's more of me on this album".<ref>Shapiro, pg. 62.</ref> 

Although Carey performed live occasionally, stage fright prevented her from embarking on a major tour.<ref>Kaufman, Gil. [http://www.vh1.com/news/editorial/?page=1&contentId=1583255 "20 Things You Didn't Know About Mariah Carey"]. ''[[VH1]]''. [[March 12]] [[2008]]. Retrieved [[March 12]] [[2008]].</ref> Her first widely seen appearance was featured on the television show ''[[MTV Unplugged]]'' in 1992, and she remarked that she felt her performance that night proved her vocal abilities were not, as some had previously speculated, simulated with studio equipment.<ref>Shapiro, pg. 69.</ref> Alongside acoustic versions of some of her earlier songs, Carey premiered a cover of [[The Jackson 5]]'s "[[I'll Be There]]" with her back-up singer [[Trey Lorenz]].  The duet was released as a single, reached number one in the U.S., and led to a record deal for Lorenz, whose debut album Carey later co-produced. Because of high [[Nielsen Ratings|ratings]] for the ''Unplugged'' television special, the concert's set list was released on the EP ''[[MTV Unplugged (EP)|MTV Unplugged]]'', which ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' called "the strongest, most genuinely musical record she has ever made [...] Did this live performance help her take her first steps toward growing up?".<ref>Sandow, Greg. "''MTV Unplugged EP''". ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''. [[June 19]] [[1992]].</ref>

=== 1993&ndash;1996: Worldwide popularity ===

Carey and [[Tommy Mottola]] had become involved romantically during the making of her debut album, and in June 1993, they were married.

[[Kenneth "Babyface" Edmonds]] consulted on the album ''[[Music Box (album)|Music Box]]'', which was released later that year and became Carey's most successful worldwide. It yielded her first [[UK Singles Chart]] number-one,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.onlineweb.com/theones/auxiliary_pages/double_top.htm |title=The UK Number Ones : Double Tops |work=A Half Century of British Number Ones}} Retrieved [[January 2]] [[2008]].</ref> a cover of [[Badfinger]]'s "[[Without You]]", and the U.S. number-ones "[[Dreamlover]]" and "[[Hero (Mariah Carey song)|Hero]]". ''Billboard'' magazine proclaimed it "heart-piercing [...] easily the most elemental of Carey's releases, her vocal [[wikt:eurythmics|eurythmics]] in natural sync with the songs",<ref>White, Timothy. "Mariah Carey's stirring 'Music Box'". ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''. New York: pg. 5, [[August 28]] [[1993]], Vol. 105, Iss. 35.</ref> but ''[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]'' magazine lamented Carey's attempt at a mellower work, "[''Music Box''] seems perfunctory and almost passionless [...] Carey could be a pop-soul great; instead she has once again settled for [[Antonio Salieri|Salieri]]-like mediocrity."<ref>Farley, Christopher John. [http://www.time.com/time/archive/preview/0,10987,979158,00.html "Hurray! a B Minus!"]. ''[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]''. [[September 6]] [[1993]]. Retrieved [[March 4]] [[2006]].</ref> In response to such comments, Carey said, "As soon as you have a big success, a lot of people don't like that. There's nothing I can do about it. All I can do is make music I believe in."<ref>Shapiro, pg. 78.</ref> Most critics slighted the opening of her subsequent U.S. [[Music Box Tour]].<ref>Shapiro, pg. 84.</ref>

In late 1994, after her duet with [[Luther Vandross]] on a cover of [[Lionel Richie]] and [[Diana Ross]]'s "[[Endless Love (song)|Endless Love]]" became a hit, Carey released the holiday album ''[[Merry Christmas (Mariah Carey album)|Merry Christmas]]''. It contained cover material and original compositions such as "[[All I Want for Christmas Is You]]", which became Carey's biggest single in [[Japan]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www2.wbs.ne.jp/~ms-db/oricon/japan%20no1%20single%2068-.htm |title=Japan - No1 Single (1968-2007) |language=Japanese}} Retrieved [[January 2]] [[2008]].</ref> and, in subsequent years, emerged as one of her most perennially popular songs on U.S. radio.<ref name="AMG">[http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:gf2gtq4ztu4a~T51 "Mariah Carey &ndash; Billboard Singles"].

In 1995, Columbia released Carey's fifth album, ''[[Daydream (Mariah Carey album)|Daydream]]'', which combined the pop sensibilities of ''Music Box'' with downbeat R&B and [[hip hop music|hip hop]] influences. A remix of "[[Fantasy (Mariah Carey song)|Fantasy]]", its first single, featured rapper [[Ol' Dirty Bastard]]. Carey said that Columbia reacted negatively to her intentions for the album: "Everybody was like 'What, are you crazy?'. They're very nervous about breaking the formula."<ref>Shapiro, pg. 92.</ref> It became her biggest-selling album in the U.S., and its singles achieved similar success&mdash;"Fantasy" became the second single to debut at number one in the U.S. and topped the [[Canadian Singles Chart]] for twelve weeks, "[[One Sweet Day]]" (a duet with [[Boyz II Men]]) spent a record-holding sixteen weeks at number one in the U.S., and "[[Always Be My Baby]]" (co-produced by [[Jermaine Dupri]]) was the most successful on U.S. radio in 1996, according to ''Billboard'' magazine. ''Daydream'' generated career-best reviews for Carey,<ref>Shapiro, pg. 94&ndash;96.</ref> and publications such as ''[[The New York Times]]'' named it one of 1995's best albums; the ''Times'' wrote that its "best cuts bring pop candy-making to a new peak of textural refinement [...] Carey's songwriting has taken a leap forward, becoming more relaxed, sexier and less reliant on thudding clich<U+00E9>s".<ref>Holden, Stephen. "Mariah Carey Glides Into New Territory". ''[[The New York Times]]''. pg. 76, [[October 13]] [[1995]].</ref> The short but profitable [[Daydream World Tour]] augmented sales of the album, which received six Grammy Award nominations.

=== 1997&ndash;2000: New image and independence ===

Carey and Mottola officially separated in 1997. Although the public image of the marriage was a happy one, she said that in reality she had felt trapped by her relationship with Mottola, whom she often described as controlling.<ref>Shapiro, pg. 97&ndash;98.</ref> They officially announced their separation in 1997, and their divorce became final the following year. Soon after the separation, Carey hired an independent publicist and a new attorney and manager. She continued to write and produce for other artists during this period, contributing to the debut albums of [[Allure (group)|Allure]] and 7 Mile through her short-lived imprint [[Crave Records]].{{Fact|date=February 2008}}

Carey's next album, ''[[Butterfly (Mariah Carey album)|Butterfly]]'' (1997), yielded the number-one single "[[Honey (Mariah Carey song)|Honey]]", the lyrics and [[music video]] for which presented a more overtly sexual image of her than had been previously seen.<ref>Shapiro, pg. 101; Handelman.</ref> She stated that ''Butterfly'' marked the point that she attained full creative control over her music.<ref name="foxnewsbiography">[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,205054,00.html Mariah Carey's Biography]. [[Fox News]]. [[March 24]] [[2008]]. Retrieved [[April 1]] [[2008]].</ref> However, she added: "I don't think it's that much of a departure from what I've done in the past [...] It's not like I went psycho and thought I was going to be a rapper. Personally, this album is about doing whatever the hell I wanted to do."<ref>Shapiro, pg. 101.</ref> Reviews were generally positive: [[LAUNCHcast]] said ''Butterfly'' "pushes the envelope", a move its critic thought "may prove disconcerting to more conservative fans" but praised as "a welcome change".<ref>Reynolds, J.R.

Retrieved [[March 17]] [[2006]].</ref> The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' wrote, "[''Butterfly''] is easily the most personal, confessional-sounding record she's ever done [...] Carey-bashing just might become a thing of the past."<ref>Johnson, Connie. ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''. pg. 58, [[September 14]] [[1997]].</ref> The album was a commercial success&mdash;though not to the degree of her previous three albums&mdash;and "[[My All]]" (her thirteenth [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] number-one) gave her the record for the most U.S. number-ones by a female artist.{{Fact|date=February 2008}}

Towards the turn of the millennium, Carey was developing the film project ''[[Glitter (film)|Glitter]]'', and wrote songs for the films ''[[Men in Black (film)|Men in Black]]'' (1997), and ''[[How the Grinch Stole Christmas (film)|How the Grinch Stole Christmas]]'' (2000).{{Fact|date=February 2008}} During the production of ''Butterfly'', Carey became romantically involved with [[New York Yankees]] baseball star [[Derek Jeter]]. Their relationship ended in 1998, with both parties citing media interference as the main reason for the split.<ref>Shapiro, pg. 112.</ref> The same year, Columbia released the album ''[[Number 1's (Mariah Carey album)|#1's]]'', a collection of Carey's U.S. number-one singles alongside new material, which she said was a way of rewarding her fans.<ref>Shapiro, pg. 116.</ref> The song "[[When You Believe]]", a duet with [[Whitney Houston]], was recorded for the soundtrack of ''[[The Prince of Egypt]]'' (1998) and won an [[Academy Award]]. ''#1's'' sold above expectations, but a review in ''[[NME]]'' labeled Carey "a purveyor of saccharine bilge like 'Hero', whose message seems wholesome enough: that if you vacate your mind of all intelligent thought, flutter your eyelashes and wish hard, sweet babies and honey will follow".<ref>[http://www.nme.com/reviews/mariah-carey/435/ "''#1's''"]. ''[[NME]]''.

''[[Rainbow (Mariah Carey album)|Rainbow]]'', Carey's seventh studio album, was released in 1999 and comprised more R&B/hip hop-oriented songs, many of them co-created with [[Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis]].<ref name="jimmy">[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_2000_August_31/ai_64995670 Hitmaking Producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis Score 14th No. 1 Hit Song].

A cover of [[Phil Collins]]'s "[[Against All Odds (Take a Look at Me Now)]]" went to number one in the UK after Carey re-recorded it with boy band [[Westlife]]. Media reception of ''Rainbow'' was generally enthusiastic, with the ''[[Sunday Herald]]'' saying the album "sees her impressively tottering between soul ballads and collaborations with R&B heavyweights like [[Snoop Doggy Dogg]], [[Usher (entertainer)|Usher]] [...] It's a polished collection of pop-soul".<ref>Virtue, Graham. "''Rainbow'', Mariah Carey". ''[[Sunday Herald]]'', [[November 7]] [[1999]].</ref> ''[[VIBE]]'' magazine expressed similar sentiments, writing, "She pulls out all stops [...] ''Rainbow'' will garner even more adoration",<ref>"Mariah Carey, ''Rainbow''". ''[[VIBE]]''. pg. 258, December 1999.</ref> but it became Carey's lowest selling album up to that point,<ref name="foxnewsbiography"/> and there was a recurring criticism that the tracks were too alike. When the [[double A-side]] "[[Crybaby (song)|Crybaby]]" (featuring Snoop Dogg)/"[[Can't Take That Away (Mariah's Theme)]]" became her first single to peak outside the U.S. top twenty, Carey accused Sony of under promoting it: "The political situation in my professional career is not positive [...] I'm getting a lot of negative feedback from certain corporate people", she wrote on her official website.<ref>Shapiro, pg. 134.</ref>

=== 2001&ndash;2004: Personal and professional struggles ===

After receiving [[Billboard Artist of the Decade Award|''Billboard'''s Artist of the Decade Award]] and the World Music Award for Best-Selling Female Artist of the Millennium,<ref name="best selling"/> Carey parted from Columbia and signed a contract with [[EMI]]'s [[Virgin Records]] worth a reported US$80 million.<ref name="Boston"/> She often stated that Columbia had regarded her as a commodity, with her separation from Mottola exacerbating her relations with label executives.

== Artistry ==

Carey has said that from childhood she was influenced by R&B and soul musicians such as [[Billie Holiday]], [[Sarah Vaughan]], [[Gladys Knight]], [[Aretha Franklin]], [[Al Green]] and [[Stevie Wonder]].{{Fact|date=February 2008}}Her music contains strong influences of [[gospel music]], and her favorite gospel singers include [[The Clark Sisters]], [[Shirley Caesar]] and [[Edwin Hawkins]].<ref>Norent, Lynn. "Mariah Carey: 'Not another White girl trying to sing Black'". ''[[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]]''. March 1991.</ref> When Carey incorporated hip hop into her sound, speculation arose that she was making an attempt to take advantage of the genre's popularity, but she told ''[[Newsweek]]'', "People just don't understand. I grew up with this music".<ref>Shapiro, pg. 124.</ref> She has expressed appreciation for rappers such as [[The Sugarhill Gang]], [[Eric B. & Rakim]], the [[Wu-Tang Clan]], [[The Notorious B.I.G.]] and [[Mobb Deep]],<ref name="Vibe-Apr1996"/> with whom she collaborated on the single "[[The Roof (Back in Time)]]" (1998).

During Carey's career, her vocal and musical style, along with her level of success, has been compared to [[Whitney Houston]] and [[Celine Dion]]. Carey and her peers, according to Garry Mulholland, are "the princesses of wails [...] virtuoso vocalists who blend chart-oriented pop with mature [[middle of the road|MOR]] [[torch song]]".<ref>Mulholland, Garry. ''The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Music'' (2003). pg. 57. UK: Flame Tree Publishing. ISBN 1-904041-70-1.</ref> In ''She Bop II: The Definitive History of Women in Rock, Pop and Soul'' (2002), writer Lucy O'Brien attributed the comeback of [[Barbra Streisand]]'s "old-fashioned showgirl" to Carey and Dion, and described them and Houston as "groomed, airbrushed and overblown to perfection".<ref name="SheBopII">O'Brien, Lucy. ''She Bop II: The Definitive History of Women in Rock, Pop and Soul'' (2002). pg. 476&ndash;477. UK: Continuum. ISBN 0-8264-5776-2 (paperback).</ref> Carey's musical transition and use of more revealing clothing during the late 1990s were, in part, initiated to distance herself from this image, and she subsequently said that most of her early work was "schmaltzy MOR".<ref name="SheBopII"/> Some have noted that unlike Houston and Dion, Carey co-writes her own songs, and the ''Guinness Rockopedia'' (1998) classified her as the "songbird supreme".<ref>''Guinness Rockopedia'' (1998). pg. 74. UK: Guinness Publishing Ltd. ISBN 0-85112-072-5.</ref>

Despite the fact that Carey is often credited with co-writing her material, she has also been accused of plagiarism on several occasions. Many of these cases were eventually settled out of court.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,28109,00.html |title=Mariah Carey's 'Hero': The Envelope Please ||author=Roger Friedman |work=[[Fox News Channel|Fox News]] |}}[[June 26]] [[2001]].
