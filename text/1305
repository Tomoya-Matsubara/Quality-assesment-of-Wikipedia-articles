On May 9, 2009, after being informed by the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] the product's risks outweighed the benefits, the company shut down operations.

The corporation was also criticized for some design elements of its clinical trials related to the need to perform critical care and resuscitation while patients were in grave clinical conditions due to the mechanisms of injury incurred and the consequent inability of patients to provide informed consent for treatment.<ref>http://blogs.abcnews.com/theblotter/2007/05/test_of_controv.html</ref>
