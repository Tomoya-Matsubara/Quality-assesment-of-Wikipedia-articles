'''Constantine Dalassenos''' ({{lang-el|<U+039A><U+03C9><U+03BD><U+03C3><U+03C4><U+03B1><U+03BD><U+03C4><U+03AF><U+03BD><U+03BF><U+03C2> <U+0394><U+03B1><U+03BB><U+03B1><U+03C3><U+03C3><U+03B7><U+03BD><U+03CC><U+03C2>}}, ''[[floruit|fl.]]'' ca. 1086 <U+2013> 1093) was a prominent [[Byzantine]] military leader on land and sea during the early reign of Emperor [[Alexios I Komnenos]] (r. 1081<U+2013>1118). Information on his life is only known from the ''[[Alexiad]]'' of [[Anna Komnene]].

== Life ==
According to the ''Alexiad'', he was related to Alexios I through his mother, although the exact connection is unknown.<ref name="A183">''Alexiad'' VII.8 (Dawes ed, p. 183)</ref><ref name="S61">Skoulatos (1980), p. 61</ref> He first appears in 1086/1087, when he was sent as an envoy to receive [[Sinope]] and the surrounding towns from a Turkish ''[[chiaus]]'' who had turned renegade, had become baptized and collaborated with the Byzantines. Dalassenos became Sinope's governor, while the ''chiaous'' was made ''[[dux|doux]]'' of [[Anchialus]].<ref>''Alexiad'' VI.9 (Dawes ed, p. 154)</ref><ref name="Skoulatos">Skoulatos (1980), pp. 61<U+2013>62</ref>

In spring 1090, Dalassenos was raised to the post of "''doux'' of the fleet" and given command of the [[Byzantine navy|Byzantine naval forces]] against the emir [[Tzachas]] of [[Smyrna]]. Tzachas, formerly a Byzantine vassal, had built a fleet of his own, had seized several Aegean islands and raided others. After taking [[Lesbos]] (except for the fortress of [[Methymna]]) and [[Chios]], he defeated a Byzantine fleet under Niketas Kastamonites.<ref name="A183"/><ref name="S61"/> Taking advantage of Tzachas' absence in Smyrna, Dalassenos disembarked his troops on Chios and immediately assailed the island's fortified [[Chios (town)|capital]]. Although the Byzantines seized the town's harbour, they failed to break through into the city itself. Meanwhile Tzachas had gathered, according to the ''Alexiad'', 8,000 men, and set off to the island's relief. His army marched on land up to the shore opposite the island, while his fleet followed, sailing along the shore. Dalassenos had charged [[Constantine Opos (megas doux)|Constantine Opos]] with hindering the Turks from crossing over, but when the Turks crossed over under the cover of night he refused to engage them when he saw that Tzachas had had his ships chained together.<ref name="S61"/><ref>''Alexiad'' VII.8 (Dawes ed, pp. 183<U+2013>184)</ref> The two armies engaged in skirmishes, but soon negotiations began. Dalassenos deferred any decision; and when Tzachas returned to Smyrna (perhaps to gather more forces), he gathered his men, prepared more siege engines and took the citadel of Chios in a surprise attack.<ref name="S61"/><ref>''Alexiad'' VII.8 (Dawes ed, pp. 184<U+2013>187)</ref>

In 1091, Dalassenos is recorded as participating in Alexios I's campaign against the [[Cumans]] in the [[Balkans]]. In the decisive [[Battle of Levounion]] on 29 April 1091, he commanded the army's left wing.<ref name="S61"/><ref>''Alexiad'' VIII.5 (Dawes ed, p. 203)</ref>

In 1092, he was again sent against Tzachas, with the title of ''thalassokrator'' ("master of the sea"), subordinated to the new ''[[megas doux]]'', [[John Doukas (megas doux)|John Doukas]]. The two commanders were to attack [[Mytilene]] on Lesbos, still held by Tzachas. Doukas, at the head of the land forces, arrived first, and attacked the town. The siege lasted for three months, before Tzachas offered to surrender the town in ecchange for safe passage back to Smyrna. Doukas agreed, but Dalassenos, who had just arrived, attacked the Turkish fleet. He captured many of the Turkish vessels, and ordered the crews, including the rowers, executed.<ref name="Skoulatos"/><ref>''Alexiad'' IX.1 (Dawes ed, pp. 214<U+2013>217)</ref> Dalassenos then returned to Constantinople. In spring 1093, when Tzachas attacked the port of [[Abydos, Hellespont|Abydos]] in the [[Sea of Marmara]], Alexios again dispatched him against the emir by sea. At the same time however, Alexios called upon the [[Seljuk]] Sultan [[Kilij Arslan I]] (r. 1092<U+2013>1107) to attack Tzachas from the rear. The Sultan complied, and in an audience had Tzachas murdered. Nothing further is known of Dalassenos after this.<ref>''Alexiad'' IX.3 (Dawes ed, pp. 219<U+2013>220)</ref><ref>Skoulatos (1980), p. 62</ref>
