'''''Hamlet''''' is a [[tragedy]] by [[William Shakespeare]], probably written between 1599 and 1601. Set in [[Denmark]], the play tells how [[Prince Hamlet]] exacts revenge on his uncle for murdering the previous king, Hamlet's father. Hamlet's uncle has since stolen the throne and taken Hamlet's mother, the dead king's widow, as his wife. The play vividly charts the course of real and feigned madness<U+2014>from overwhelming grief at bereavement to seething rage at murder and "incest"<U+2014>and explores themes of treachery and corruption. 

''Hamlet'' is by far Shakespeare's longest play, and is considered "the greatest exhibition of his powers".<ref>Thompson and Taylor (2006a, 25) and Kermode (2000, 96).</ref> During his lifetime it was one of his most popular works, and it still ranks high among his most-performed, topping, for example, the [[Royal Shakespeare Company|Royal Shakespeare Company's]] list since 1879.<ref>Crystal and Crystal (2005, 66).</ref> Despite much literary detective work, the exact year of writing remains in dispute. Three different early versions of the play<U+2014>known as the [[First Quarto]] (Q1), the [[Second Quarto]] (Q2), and the [[First Folio]] (F1)<U+2014>survive. Each has lines, and even  scenes, that are missing from the others. 

The play's dramatic structure and Shakespeare's depth of characterisation mean that ''Hamlet'' can be analysed and interpreted<U+2014>and argued about<U+2014>from many perspectives. For centuries, commentators have puzzled over Hamlet's hesitation in killing his uncle. Some see it as a [[plot device]] to prolong the action; others as the result of pressure exerted by the complex philosophical and ethical issues that surround cold-blooded murder, calculated revenge, and thwarted desire. More recently, [[Psychoanalytic literary criticism|psychoanalytic critics]] have examined Hamlet's [[unconscious mind|unconscious desires]], and feminist critics have re-evaluated and rehabilitated the often-maligned characters of [[Ophelia (character)|Ophelia]] and [[Gertrude (Hamlet)|Gertrude]].

Shakespeare probably based ''Hamlet'' on an [[Indo-European people|Indo-European]] legend<U+2014>preserved by a 13th-century chronicler, and retold by a 16th-century scholar<U+2014>and a lost [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethan]] play known today as the ''[[Ur-Hamlet]]''. Whatever its precise provenance, Shakespeare turned ''Hamlet'' into "one of the most powerful and influential tragedies in the English language" and provided a storyline capable of "seemingly endless retelling and adaptation by others".<ref>Thompson and Taylor (2006a, 74).</ref> It has inspired writers from [[Goethe]] and [[Charles Dickens|Dickens]] to [[James Joyce|Joyce]] and [[Iris Murdoch|Murdoch]], and has been described as "the world's most filmed story after ''[[Cinderella]]''".<ref>Thompson and Taylor (2006a, 17).</ref> The title role was almost certainly created for [[Richard Burbage]], the leading tragedian of Shakespeare's time;<ref name="gary">See Taylor (2002, 4); Banham (1998, 141); Hattaway asserts that "Richard Burbage ... played Hieronimo and also Richard III but then was the first Hamlet, Lear, and Othello" (1982, 91); Peter Thomson argues that the identity of Hamlet as Burbage is built into the [[dramaturgy]] of several moments of the play: "we will profoundly misjudge the position if we do not recognise that, whilst this is Hamlet talking ''about'' the groundlings, it is also Burbage talking ''to'' the groundlings" (1983, 24); see also Thomson on the first player's beard (1983, 110). A researcher at the [[British Library]] feels able to assert only that Burbage "probably" played Hamlet; see [http://www.bl.uk/treasures/shakespeare/playhamlet.html its page on ''Hamlet''].</ref> and in the four hundred years since, it has been played by the greatest actors, and sometimes actresses, of each successive age.

==Synopsis==
{{for|cast overview|Characters in Hamlet}}

[[Image:Henry Fuseli - Hamlet and the Ghost.JPG|thumb|Horatio, Hamlet, and the Ghost (Artist: [[Henry Fuseli]] 1798)<ref>''Hamlet'' 1.4.</ref>]]
The protagonist of ''Hamlet'' is [[Prince Hamlet]] of Denmark, son of the recently deceased [[King Hamlet]], and nephew of [[King Claudius]], his father's brother and successor. Claudius hastily married King Hamlet's widow, [[Gertrude (Hamlet)|Gertrude]], Hamlet's mother. Denmark has a long-standing feud with neighbouring Norway, and an invasion led by the Norwegian prince, [[Fortinbras]], is expected.

The play opens on a cold winter night at [[Kronborg Slot|Elsinore]], the Danish royal castle. The [[Characters in Hamlet#Elsinore sentries|sentries]] try to persuade Hamlet's friend [[Horatio (character)|Horatio]] that they have seen [[King Hamlet|King Hamlet's]] ghost, when it appears again. Hearing the news, Hamlet resolves to see the Ghost himself. That night, the Ghost appears to Hamlet and tells him that Claudius murdered him by pouring poison in his ears. The Ghost demands that Hamlet avenge him; Hamlet agrees and decides to feign madness to avert suspicion. He is, however, uncertain of the Ghost's reliability.

Busy with affairs of state, Claudius and Gertrude try to avert an invasion by [[Fortinbras|Prince Fortinbras of Norway]]. Perturbed by Hamlet's continuing deep mourning for his father and his increasingly erratic behaviour, they send two student friends of his<U+2014>[[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern]]<U+2014>to discover its cause. Hamlet greets his friends warmly, but quickly discerns that they are spies.

[[Polonius]] is Claudius' trusted chief counsellor; his son, [[Laertes (Hamlet)|Laertes]], is about to resume studies in France, and his daughter, [[Ophelia (character)|Ophelia]], is courting Hamlet. Neither Polonius nor Laertes approves of the match, and both warn her off. Shortly afterwards, Ophelia meets Hamlet secretly but is so alarmed by his strange antics that she tells her father of Hamlet's state. Polonius blames an "ecstasy of love"<ref>''Hamlet'' 2.1.99.</ref> for Hamlet's madness and informs Claudius and Gertrude. At their next tryst, Hamlet rants at Ophelia, accusing her of immodesty and dismissing her to a nunnery.

[[Image:Eug<U+00E8>ne Ferdinand Victor Delacroix 018.jpg|thumb|left|The "gravedigger scene"<ref name="gravedigger">''The Gravedigger Scene'': ''Hamlet'' 5.1.1<U+2013>205.</ref> (Artist: [[Eug<U+00E8>ne Delacroix]] 1839)]]
Hamlet remains unconvinced that the Ghost has told him the truth, but the arrival of a troupe of actors at Elsinore presents him with a solution. He will stage a play, re-enacting his father's murder, and determine Claudius' guilt or innocence by studying his reaction. The court assembles to watch the play; Hamlet provides a running commentary throughout. After seeing the [[Characters in Hamlet#the Players|Player King]] murdered with poison in the ears, Claudius abruptly rises and leaves the room: proof positive for Hamlet of his uncle's guilt.

Gertrude summons Hamlet to her bedchamber to demand an explanation. On his way, Hamlet passes Claudius in prayer but hesitates to kill him, reasoning that death in prayer would send him to heaven. In the bedchamber, a furious row erupts between Hamlet and Gertrude. Polonius, spying hidden behind a tapestry, makes a noise; and Hamlet, believing it is Claudius, stabs wildly, killing Polonius. The Ghost appears, urging Hamlet to treat Gertrude gently but reminding him to kill Claudius. Unable to see or hear the Ghost herself, Gertrude takes Hamlet's conversation with it as further evidence of madness. Hamlet hides Polonius' corpse; and Claudius, fearing for his life, banishes Hamlet to England on a pretext, closely watched by Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

Demented by grief at Polonius' death, Ophelia wanders Elsinore singing [[bawdy]] songs. Her brother, Laertes, arrives back from France, enraged by his father's death and his sister's madness. Claudius convinces Laertes that Hamlet is solely responsible; then news arrives that Hamlet is still at large. Claudius swiftly concocts a plot. He proposes a fencing match between Laertes and Hamlet with poison-tipped rapiers, but tacitly plans to offer Hamlet poisoned wine if that fails. Gertrude interrupts to report that Ophelia has drowned.

Two [[Characters in Hamlet#Ophelia's funeral|gravediggers]] discuss Ophelia's apparent suicide, while digging her grave. Hamlet arrives with Horatio and banters with a gravedigger, who unearths the skull of a [[jester]] from Hamlet's childhood, [[Yorick (Hamlet)|Yorick]]. Ophelia's funeral procession approaches, led by Laertes. He and Hamlet grapple, but the brawl is broken up.

Back at Elsinore, Hamlet tells Horatio how he escaped and that Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead. A courtier, [[Characters in Hamlet#Osric|Osric]], interrupts to invite Hamlet to fence with Laertes. With Fortinbras' army closing on Elsinore, the match begins. Laertes pierces Hamlet with a poisoned blade but is fatally wounded by it himself. Gertrude accidentally drinks poisoned wine and dies. In his dying moments, Laertes is reconciled with Hamlet and reveals Claudius' murderous plot. In his own last moments, Hamlet manages to kill Claudius and names Fortinbras as his heir. When Fortinbras arrives, Horatio recounts the tale and Fortinbras orders Hamlet's body borne off in honour.

==Sources==
{{Main|Sources of Hamlet}}
[[Image:Saxo original 001.jpg|thumb|A facsimile of [[Saxo Grammaticus|Saxo Grammaticus']] ''[[Gesta Danorum]]'', which contains the legend of Amleth]]

''Hamlet''-like legends are so widely found (Italy, Spain, Scandinavia, Byzantium, and Arabia) that some scholars believe the core "hero-as-fool" theme is [[Indo-European people|Indo-European]] in origin.<ref>Saxo and Hansen (1983, 36<U+2013>37).</ref> Several ancient written sources for ''Hamlet'' can be identified. The first is the anonymous Scandinavian ''[[Hr<U+00F3>lfs saga kraka|Saga of Hrolf Kraki]]''. In this, the murdered king has two sons<U+2014>[[Hro<U+00F0>gar|Hroar]] and [[Halga|Helgi]]<U+2014>who spend most of the story in disguise, under false names, rather than feigning madness, in a sequence of events that differs from Shakespeare's.<ref>Saxo and Hansen (1983, 16<U+2013>25).</ref> The second is the Roman legend of [[Lucius Junius Brutus#Biography|Brutus]], recorded in two separate Latin works. Its hero, Lucius ("shining, light"), changes his name and persona to Brutus ("dull, stupid"), playing the role of a fool to avoid the fate of his father and brothers, and eventually slaying his family's killer, King Tarquinius. A 17th-century Nordic scholar, Torfaeus, compared the Icelandic hero Amlodi and the Spanish hero Prince Ambales (from the ''Ambales Saga'') to Shakespeare's ''Hamlet''. Similarities include the prince's feigned madness, his accidental killing of the king's counsellor in his mother's bedroom, and the eventual slaying of his uncle.<ref>Saxo and Hansen (1983, 5<U+2013>15).</ref>

Many of the earlier legendary elements are interwoven in the 13th-century ''Vita Amlethi'' ("The Life of Amleth") by [[Saxo Grammaticus]], part of ''[[Gesta Danorum]]''.<ref>Saxo and Hansen (1983, 1<U+2013>5).</ref> Written in Latin, it reflects classical Roman concepts of virtue and heroism, and was widely available in Shakespeare's day.<ref>Saxo and Hansen (1983, 25<U+2013>37).</ref> Significant parallels include the prince feigning madness, his mother's hasty marriage to the usurper, the prince killing a hidden spy, and the prince substituting the execution of two retainers for his own. A reasonably faithful version of Saxo's story was translated into French in 1570 by [[Fran<U+00E7>ois de Belleforest]], in his ''Histoires tragiques''.<ref>Edwards (1985, 1<U+2013>2).</ref> Belleforest embellished Saxo's text substantially, almost doubling its length, and introduced the hero's [[melancholia|melancholy]].<ref>Saxo and Hansen (1983, 66<U+2013>67).</ref>

[[Image:The Spanish Tragedy.jpg|thumb|left|Cover of ''[[The Spanish Tragedy]]'', by Thomas Kyd. This popular [[Revenge play|revenge tragedy]] may have influenced ''Hamlet''. Its author may have also written the ''[[Ur-Hamlet]]''.]]

Shakespeare's main source is believed to be an earlier play<U+2014>now lost<U+2014>known today as the ''[[Ur-Hamlet]]''. Possibly written by [[Thomas Kyd]], the ''Ur-Hamlet'' was in performance by 1589 and is the first version of the story known to incorporate a ghost.<ref>Jenkins (1982, 82<U+2013>85).</ref> Shakespeare's company, [[Lord Chamberlain's Men|the Chamberlain's Men]], may have purchased that play and performed a version, which Shakespeare reworked, for some time.<ref>Saxo and Hansen (1983, 67).</ref> Since no copy of the ''Ur-Hamlet'' has survived, however, it is impossible to compare its language and style with the known works of any of its putative authors. Consequently, there is no direct evidence that Kyd wrote it, nor any evidence that the play was not an early version of ''Hamlet'' by Shakespeare himself. This latter idea<U+2014>placing ''Hamlet'' far earlier than the generally accepted date, with a much longer period of development<U+2014>has attracted some support, though others dismiss it as speculation.<ref> In his 1936 book ''The Problem of Hamlet: A Solution'' Andrew Carincross asserted that the ''Hamlet'' referred to in 1589 was written by Shakespeare; Peter Alexander (1964), [[Eric Sams]] (according to Jackson 1991, 267) and, more recently, [[Harold Bloom]] (2001, xiii and 383; 2003, 154) have agreed. This is also the opinion of [[Shakespearean authorship|anti-Stratfordians]] (Ogburn 1988, 631). Harold Jenkins, the editor of the second series Arden edition of the play, dismisses the idea as groundless (1982, 84 n4). [[Francis Meres]]'s ''Palladis Tamia'' (published in 1598, probably October) provides a list of twelve named Shakespeare plays, but ''Hamlet'' is not among them (Lott 1970, xlvi).</ref> 

The upshot is that scholars cannot assert with any confidence how much material Shakespeare took from the ''Ur-Hamlet'', how much from Belleforest or Saxo, and how much from other contemporary sources (such as Kyd's ''[[The Spanish Tragedy]]''). No clear evidence exists that Shakespeare made any direct references to Saxo's version. However, elements of Belleforest's version do appear in Shakespeare's play, though they are not in Saxo's story. Whether Shakespeare took these from Belleforest directly or through the ''Ur-Hamlet'' remains unclear.<ref>Saxo and Hansen (1983, 66<U+2013>68).</ref>

Scholars have debunked the idea that ''Hamlet'' is in any way connected with Shakespeare's only son, [[Hamnet Shakespeare]], who died at age eleven. ''Hamlet'' is too obviously connected to legend, and the name Hamnet was quite popular at the time.<ref>Saxo and Hansen (1983, 6).</ref>

==Date==
[[Image:Hamlet quarto 3rd.jpg|thumb|right|Frontispiece of the 1605 printing (Q2) of ''Hamlet'']]
Scholarly "dating of ''Hamlet'' must be tentative", cautions the ''New Cambridge'' editor, Phillip Edwards.<ref>MacCary suggests 1599 or 1600 (1998, 13); James Shapiro offers late 1600 or early 1601 (2005, 341); Wells and Taylor suggest that the play was written in 1600 and revised later (1988, 653); the New Cambridge editor settles on mid-1601 (Edwards 1985, 8); the New Swan Shakespeare Advanced Series editor agrees with 1601 (Lott 1970, xlvi); Thompson and Taylor, tentatively ("according to whether one is the more persuaded by Jenkins or by Honigmann") suggest a ''[[terminus ad quem]]'' of either Spring 1601 or sometime in 1600 (2001a, 58<U+2013>59).</ref> The [[Terminus post quem|earliest date estimate]] relies on ''Hamlet'''s frequent allusions to Shakespeare's ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'', itself dated to mid-1599.<ref>MacCary (1998, 12<U+2013>13) and Edwards (1985, 5<U+2013>6).</ref> The [[Terminus ante quem|latest date estimate]] is based on an entry, of [[July 26]], [[1602]], in the [[Stationers' Register|Register]] of the [[Worshipful Company of Stationers and Newspaper Makers|Stationers' Company]], indicating that ''Hamlet'' was "latelie Acted by the [[Lord Chamberlain's Men|Lo: Chamberleyne his servantes]]".

In 1598, [[Francis Meres]] published in his ''Palladis Tamia'' a survey of English literature from Chaucer to its present day, within which twelve of Shakespeare's plays are named. ''Hamlet'' is not among them, suggesting that it had not yet been written. As ''Hamlet'' was very popular, the ''New Swan'' series editor Bernard Lott believes it "unlikely that he [Meres] would have overlooked ... so significant a piece".<ref name="lott">Lott (1970, xlvi).</ref>

The F1 phrase "little eyases"<ref>''Hamlet F1'' 2.2.337. The whole conversation between Rozencrantz, Guildenstern and Hamlet concerning the touring players' departure from the city is at ''Hamlet "F1"'' 2.2.324<U+2013>360.</ref> may allude to the [[Children of the Chapel]], whose popularity in London forced the Globe company into provincial touring. This became known as the [[War of the Theatres]], and supports a 1601 dating.<ref name="lott"/>

A contemporary of Shakespeare's, [[Gabriel Harvey]], wrote a marginal note in his copy of the 1598 edition of [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer's]] works, which some scholars use as dating evidence. Harvey's note says that "the wiser sort" enjoy ''Hamlet'', and implies that [[Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex|the Earl of Essex]]<U+2014>executed in February 1601 for rebellion<U+2014>was still alive. Other scholars consider this inconclusive. Edwards, for example, concludes that the "sense of time is so confused in Harvey's note that it is really of little use in trying to date ''Hamlet''". This is because the same note also refers to [[Edmund Spenser|Spenser]] and [[Thomas Watson (poet)|Watson]] as if they were still alive ("our flourishing [[Meter (poetry)|metricians]]"), but also mentions "[[John Owen (epigrammatist)|Owen's]] new epigrams", published in 1607.<ref>Edwards (1985, 5).</ref>

==Texts==

Three early editions of the text have survived, making attempts to establish a single authentic text problematic.<ref>Hattaway (1987, 13<U+2013>20).</ref> Each is different from the others:<ref>Chambers (1923, vol.&nbsp;3, 486<U+2013>487) and Halliday (1964, 204<U+2013>205).</ref>

* '''Q1.''' In 1603, the booksellers Nicholas Ling and John Trundell published<U+2014>and [[Valentine Simmes]] printed<U+2014>the so-called "[[Bad quarto|bad]]" first [[Bookbinding#Terms and techniques|Quarto]]. Q1 contains just over half of the text of the later second quarto.
* '''Q2.''' In 1604, Nicholas Ling published, and James Roberts printed, the second quarto. Some copies are dated 1605, which may indicate a second impression; consequently, Q2 is often dated "1604/5". Q2 is the longest early edition, although it omits 85 lines found in F1 (most likely to avoid offending [[James I of England|James I's]] queen, [[Anne of Denmark]]).<ref name="Halliday">Halliday (1964, 204).</ref>
* '''F1.''' In 1623, [[Edward Blount]] and [[William Jaggard|William and Isaac Jaggard]] published the [[First Folio]], the first edition of Shakespeare's ''Complete Works''.<ref>Thompson and Taylor (2006a, 78).</ref>

Other [[Folios and Quartos (Shakespeare)|folios and quartos]] were subsequently published<U+2014>including [[John Smethwick|John Smethwick's]] Q3, Q4, and Q5 (1611&ndash;37)<U+2014>but these are regarded as derivatives of the first three editions.<ref>Thompson and Taylor (2006a, 78).</ref>

[[Image:To be or not to be (Q1).jpg|thumb|right|The Q1 rendering of the "[[To be or not to be]]" soliloquy]]
Early [[Shakespeare's editors|editors of Shakespeare's works]], beginning with [[Nicholas Rowe (dramatist)|Nicholas Rowe]] (1709) and [[Lewis Theobald]] (1733), combined material from the two earliest sources of ''Hamlet'' available at the time, Q2 and F1. Each text contains material that the other lacks, with many minor differences in wording: scarcely 200 lines are identical in the two. Editors have combined them in an effort to create one "inclusive" text that reflects an imagined "ideal" of Shakespeare's original. Theobald's version became standard for a long time,<ref>Hibbard (1987, 22<U+2013>23).</ref> and his "full text" approach continues to influence editorial practice to the present day. Some contemporary scholarship, however, discounts this approach, instead considering "an authentic ''Hamlet'' an unrealisable ideal. ... there are ''texts'' of this play but no ''text''".<ref>Hattaway (1987, 16).</ref> The 2006 publication by Arden Shakespeare of different ''Hamlet'' texts in different volumes is perhaps the best evidence of this shifting focus and emphasis.<ref>Thompson and Taylor published Q2, with appendices, in their first volume (2006a) and the F1 and Q1 texts in their second volume (2006b). Bate and Rasmussen (2007) is the F1 text with additional Q2 passages in an appendix. The New Cambridge series has begun to publish separate volumes for the separate quarto versions that exist of Shakespeare's plays (Irace 1998).</ref>

Traditionally, editors of Shakespeare's plays have divided them into five [[Act (theater)|acts]]. None of the early texts of ''Hamlet'', however, was arranged this way, and the play's division into acts and scenes derives from a 1676 quarto. Modern editors generally follow this traditional division, but consider it unsatisfactory; for example, after Hamlet drags Polonius' body out of Gertrude's bedchamber, there is an act-break<ref>''Hamlet'' 3.4 and 4.1.</ref> after which the action appears to continue uninterrupted.<ref>Thompson and Taylor (2006a, 543<U+2013>552).</ref> 

The discovery in 1823 of Q1<U+2014>whose existence had been quite unsuspected<U+2014>caused considerable interest and excitement, raising many questions of editorial practice and interpretation. Scholars immediately identified apparent deficiencies in Q1, which was instrumental in the development of the concept of a Shakespearean "[[bad quarto]]".<ref>Jenkins (1982, 14).</ref> Yet Q1 has value: it contains stage directions that reveal actual stage practices in a way that Q2 and F1 do not; it contains an entire scene (usually labelled 4.6)<ref>''Hamlet Q1'' 14.</ref> that does not appear in either Q2 or F1; and it is useful for comparison with the later editions.

Q1 is considerably shorter than Q2 or F1 and may be a [[memorial reconstruction]] of the play as Shakespeare's company performed it, by an actor who played a minor role (most likely Marcellus).<ref>Jackson (1986, 171).</ref> Scholars disagree whether the reconstruction was pirated or authorised. Another theory, considered by New Cambridge editor Kathleen Irace, holds that Q1 is an abridged version intended especially for travelling productions.<ref>Irace (1998); Thompson and Taylor (2006a, 85<U+2013>86).</ref>  The idea that Q1 is not riddled with error but is instead eminently fit for the stage has led to at least 28 different Q1 productions since 1881.<ref>Thompson and Taylor (2006b, 36<U+2013>37) and ''Checklist of Q1 Productions'' in Thompson and Taylor (2006b, 38<U+2013>39).</ref> Perhaps the most notable was Tim Sheridan and Andrew Borba's 2003 production at the Theatre of NOTE in Los Angeles, for which Irace served as [[dramaturge]].<ref>Thompson and Taylor (2006b, 17).</ref>

==Analysis and criticism==
{{Main|Critical approaches to Hamlet}}

===Critical history===

From the early 17th century, the play was famous for its innovative ghost and vivid dramatization of [[melancholy]] and [[insanity]], leading to a procession of mad courtiers and ladies in [[Jacobean era|Jacobean]] and Caroline drama.<ref>Wofford (1994) and Kirsch (1968).</ref> Though it remained popular with mass audiences, late 17th-century [[English Restoration|Restoration]] critics saw ''Hamlet'' as primitive and disapproved of its lack of [[Classical unities|unity]] and [[decorum]].<ref>Vickers (1974a, 447) and (1974b, 92).</ref> This view changed drastically in the 18th century, when critics regarded Hamlet as a hero<U+2014>a pure, brilliant young man thrust into unfortunate circumstances.<ref>Wofford (1994, 184<U+2013>185).</ref> By the mid-18th century, however, the advent of [[Gothic literature]] brought [[Psychology|psychological]] and [[Mysticism|mystical]] readings, returning madness and the Ghost to the forefront.<ref>Vickers (1974c, 5).</ref> Not until the late 18th century did critics and performers begin to view Hamlet as confusing and inconsistent. Before then, he was either mad, or not; either a hero, or not; with no in-betweens.<ref>Wofford (1994, 185).</ref> These developments represented a fundamental change in literary criticism, which came to focus more on character and less on plot.<ref>Wofford (1994, 186).</ref> By the 19th century, [[Romanticism|Romantic]] critics valued ''Hamlet'' for its internal, individual conflict reflecting the strong contemporary emphasis on internal struggles and inner character in general.<ref>Rosenberg (1992, 179).</ref> Then too, critics started to focus on Hamlet's delay as a character trait, rather than a plot device.<ref>Wofford (1994, 186).</ref> This focus on character and internal struggle continued into the 20th century, when criticism branched in several directions, discussed in [[#Context and interpretation|context and interpretation]] below.

===Dramatic structure===
''Hamlet'' departed from contemporary dramatic convention in several ways. First, in Shakespeare's day, plays were usually expected to follow the advice of [[Aristotle]] in his ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'': that a drama should focus on action, not character. In ''Hamlet'', Shakespeare reverses this so that it is through the [[soliloquy|soliloquies]], not the action, that the audience learns Hamlet's motives and thoughts. Second<U+2014>and unlike Shakespeare's other plays<U+2014>there is no strong subplot; all plot-forks directly connect to the main vein of Hamlet's struggle for revenge. The play is full of seeming discontinuities and irregularities of action. At one point, as in the Gravedigger scene,<ref name="gravedigger"/> Hamlet seems resolved to kill Claudius: in the next scene, however, when Claudius appears, he is suddenly tame. Scholars still debate whether these twists are mistakes or intentional additions to add to the play's theme of confusion and duality.<ref>MacCary (1998, 67<U+2013>72, 84).</ref> Finally, in a period when most plays ran for two hours or so, the full text of ''Hamlet''<U+2014>Shakespeare's longest play, with 4,042 lines, totalling 29,551 words<U+2014>takes over four hours to deliver.<ref>Based on the length of the first edition of ''The Riverside Shakespeare'' (1974).</ref> ''Hamlet'' also contains a favourite Shakespearean device, a [[Story within a story#Play within a play|play within the play]].<ref>Also used in [[Love's Labour's Lost]] and [[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]. Kermode (2000, 256).</ref> Though it was first called ''The Murder of Gonzago'', Hamlet changes the name to ''The Mousetrap'' when he modifies the plot.

===Language===
[[Image:Delacroix-1834-I2-QueenConsolesHamlet.JPG|thumb|right|Hamlet's statement that his dark clothes are the outer sign of his inner grief demonstrates strong rhetorical skill. (Artist: [[Eug<U+00E8>ne Delacroix]] 1834).]]

Much of the play's language is courtly: elaborate, witty discourse, as recommended by [[Baldassare Castiglione|Baldassare Castiglione's]] 1528 etiquette guide, ''The Courtier''. This work specifically advises royal retainers to amuse their masters with inventive language. Osric and Polonius, especially, seem to respect this injunction. Claudius' speech is rich with rhetorical figures<U+2014>as is Hamlet's and, at times, Ophelia's<U+2014>while the language of Horatio, the guards, and the gravediggers is simpler. Claudius' high status is reinforced by using the royal first person plural ("we" or "us"), and [[anaphora]] mixed with [[metaphor]] to resonate with Greek political speeches.<ref>MacCary (1998, 84<U+2013>85).</ref>

Hamlet is the most skilled of all at rhetoric. He uses highly developed metaphors, and  in nine memorable words deploys both [[anaphora]] and [[asyndeton]]: "to die: to sleep<U+2014>&nbsp;/ To sleep, perchance to dream".<ref>''Hamlet'' 3.1.63<U+2013>64.</ref> In contrast, when occasion demands, he is precise and straightforward, as when he explains his inward emotion to his mother: "But I have that within which passes show,&nbsp;/ These but the trappings and the suits of woe".<ref>''Hamlet'' 1.2.85<U+2013>86.</ref> At other times, he relies heavily on puns to express his true thoughts while simultaneously concealing them.<ref>MacCary (1998, 89<U+2013>90).</ref> His "nunnery" remarks<ref>''Hamlet'' 3.1.87<U+2013>148 especially lines 120, 129, 136, 139 and 148.</ref>  to Ophelia are an example of a cruel [[double entendre|double meaning]] as ''nunnery'' was [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethan]] slang for ''brothel''.<ref>Oxford English Dictionary (2004, CD).</ref>

An unusual rhetorical device, [[hendiadys]], appears in several places in the play. Examples are found in Ophelia's speech at the end of the nunnery scene: "Th'''expectation and rose'' of the fair state"; "And I, of ladies most ''deject and wretched''".<ref>''Hamlet'' 3.1.151 and 3.1.154. ''The Nunnery Scene'': ''Hamlet'' 3.1.87<U+2013>160.</ref> Many scholars have found it odd that Shakespeare would, seemingly arbitrarily, use this rhetorical form throughout the play. One explanation may be that ''Hamlet'' was written later in Shakespeare's life, when he was adept at matching rhetorical devices to characters and the plot. Linguist George T. Wright suggests that hendiadys was used deliberately to heighten the play's sense of duality and dislocation.<ref>MacCary (1998, 87<U+2013>88).</ref>

Hamlet's [[soliloquy|soliloquies]] have also captured the attention of scholars. Hamlet interrupts himself, vocalising either disgust or agreement with himself, and embellishing his own words. He has difficulty expressing himself directly and instead blunts the thrust of his thought with wordplay. It is not until late in the play, after his experience with the pirates, that Hamlet is able to articulate his feelings freely.<ref>MacCary (1998, 91<U+2013>93).</ref>

==Context and interpretation==
===Religious===
[[Image:Millais - Ophelia.jpg|thumb|''[[Ophelia (painting)|Ophelia]]'' depicts her mysterious death by drowning. The clowns' discussion of whether her death was a suicide and whether she merits a Christian burial is at heart a religious topic. (Artist: [[John Everett Millais]] 1852).]]

Written at a time of religious upheaval, and in the wake of the [[English Reformation]], the play is alternately [[Catholicism|Catholic]] (or superstitiously medieval) and [[Protestantism|Protestant]] (or consciously modern). The Ghost describes himself as being in [[purgatory]], and as dying without [[last rites]]. This and Ophelia's burial ceremony, which is characteristically Catholic, make up most of the play's Catholic connections. Some scholars have observed that revenge tragedies come from traditionally Catholic countries, such as Spain and Italy; and they present a contradiction, since according to Catholic doctrine the strongest duty is to God and family. Hamlet's conundrum, then, is whether to avenge his father and kill Claudius, or to leave the vengeance to God, as his religion requires.<ref>MacCary (1998, 37<U+2013>38); in the [[New Testament]], see Romans 12:19: "&nbsp;'vengeance is mine, I will repay' sayeth the Lord".</ref>

Much of the play's Protestantism derives from its location in Denmark<U+2014>then and now a predominantly Protestant country, though it is unclear whether the fictional Denmark of the play is intended to mirror this fact. The play does mention Wittenberg, where Hamlet, Horatio, and Rosencrantz and Guildenstern attend university, and where [[Martin Luther]] first nailed up his [[95 theses]].<ref>MacCary (1998, 38).</ref> When Hamlet speaks of the "special providence in the fall of a sparrow",<ref>''Hamlet'' 5.2.197<U+2013>202.</ref> he reflects the Protestant belief that the will of God<U+2014>[[Divine Providence]]<U+2014>controls even the smallest event. In Q1, the first sentence of the same section reads: "There's a predestinate providence in the fall of a sparrow,"<ref>''Hamlet Q1'' 17.45<U+2013>46.</ref> which suggests an even stronger Protestant connection through [[John Calvin|John Calvin's]] theories of [[predestination]]. Scholars speculate that ''Hamlet'' may have been censored, as "predestined" appears only in this quarto.<ref>Blits (2001, 3<U+2013>21).</ref>

===Philosophical===
[[Image:Michel-eyquem-de-montaigne 1.jpg|thumb|Philosophical ideas in ''Hamlet'' are similar to those of the French writer [[Michel de Montaigne]], a contemporary of Shakespeare's. (Artist: [[Thomas de Leu]] (fl.&nbsp;1580<U+2013>1610)).]]
Hamlet is often perceived as a philosophical character, expounding ideas that are now described as [[relativism|relativist]], [[existentialism|existentialist]], and [[skepticism|sceptical]]. For example, he expresses a relativistic idea when he says to Rosencrantz: "there is nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so".<ref>''Hamlet F1'' 2.2.247<U+2013>248.</ref> The idea that nothing is real except in the mind of the individual finds its roots in the Greek [[Sophism|Sophists]], who argued that since nothing can be perceived except through the senses<U+2014>and since all individuals sense, and therefore perceive, things differently<U+2014>there is no absolute truth, only relative truth.<ref>MacCary (1998, 47<U+2013>48).</ref> The clearest example of existentialism is found in the "[[To be, or not to be]]"<ref>''Hamlet'' 3.1.55<U+2013>87 especially line 55.</ref> speech, where Hamlet uses "being" to allude to both life and action, and "not being" to death and inaction. Hamlet's contemplation of suicide in this scene, however, is less philosophical than religious as he believes that he will continue to exist after death.<ref>MacCary (1998, 28<U+2013>49).</ref>

Scholars agree that ''Hamlet'' reflects the contemporary [[Philosophical skepticism|scepticism]] that prevailed in [[Renaissance humanism]].<ref name= m49>MacCary (1998, 49).</ref> Prior to Shakespeare's time, humanists had argued that man was God's greatest creation, made in God's image and able to choose his own nature, but this view was challenged, notably in [[Michel de Montaigne|Michel de Montaigne's]] ''[[Essais]]'' of 1590. Hamlet's "[[What a piece of work is a man]]" echoes many of Montaigne's ideas, but scholars disagree whether Shakespeare drew directly from Montaigne or whether both men were simply reacting similarly to the spirit of the times.<ref>Knowles (1999, 1049 and 1052<U+2013>1053) cited by Thompson and Taylor (2006a, 73<U+2013>74); MacCary (1998, 49).</ref>

===Political===
In the early 17th century political [[satire]] was discouraged, and playwrights were punished for "offensive" works. In 1597, [[Ben Jonson]] was jailed for his participation in the play ''[[The Isle of Dogs (play)|The Isle of Dogs]]''.<ref>Baskerville (1934, 827<U+2013>830).</ref> [[Thomas Middleton]] was imprisoned in 1624, and his ''[[A Game at Chess]]'' was banned after nine performances.<ref>Jones (2007, web page).</ref> Numerous scholars believe that ''Hamlet'''s Polonius poked fun at the safely deceased [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley|William Cecil]] (Lord Burghley)<U+2014>Lord High Treasurer and chief counsellor to Queen [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth&nbsp;I]]<ref>French writes in 1869: "The next important personages in the play are the 'Lord Chamberlain', Polonius; his son, Laertes; and daughter, Ophelia; and these are supposed to stand for Queen Elizabeth's celebrated Lord High Treasurer, Sir William Cecil, Lord Burleigh; his second son, Robert Cecil; and his daughter, Anne Cecil" (301). Excepts from his research may be found [http://www.sourcetext.com/sourcebook/essays/polonius/texts.html here]. In 1932, John Dover Wilson wrote: "the figure of Polonius is almost without doubt intended as a caricature of Burleigh, who died on [[August 4]], [[1598]]" (1932, 104).</ref><U+2014>as numerous parallels can be found. Polonius' role as elder statesman is similar to the role Burghley enjoyed;<ref>Winstanley (1921, 112). Winstanley devotes 20 pages proposing connections between scenes involving Polonius and people and events in Elizabethan England.</ref> Polonius' advice to Laertes may echo Burghley's to his son [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury|Robert Cecil]];<ref>See Chambers (1930, 418); in 1964, Hurstfield and Sutherland wrote: "The governing classes were both paternalistic and patronizing; and nowhere is this attitude better displayed than in the advice which that archetype of elder statesmen William Cecil, Lord Burghley<U+2014>Shakespeare's Polonius<U+2014>prepared for his son" (1964, 35).</ref> and Polonius' tedious verbosity may resemble Burghley's.<ref>Rowse (1963, 323).</ref> Also, "Corambis", (Polonius' name in Q1) resonates with the Latin for "double-hearted"<U+2014>which may satirise Lord Burghley's Latin motto ''Cor unum, via una'' ("One heart, one way").<ref>Ogburn (1988, 202<U+2013>203). As glossed by [http://www.sourcetext.com/sourcebook/essays/polonius/corambis3.html Mark Anderson], "With 'cor' meaning 'heart' and with 'bis' or 'ambis' meaning 'twice' or 'double', Corambis can be taken for the Latin of 'double-hearted,' which implies 'deceitful' or 'two-faced'."</ref> Lastly, the relationship of Polonius' daughter Ophelia with Hamlet may be compared to the relationship of Burghley's daughter, Anne Cecil, with the Earl of Oxford, [[Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford|Edward de Vere]].<ref>Winstanley (1921, 122<U+2013>124).</ref> These arguments are also offered in support of the [[Shakespeare authorship question|Shakespeare authorship claims]] for the [[Oxfordian theory|Earl of Oxford]].<ref>Ogburn (1984, 84<U+2013>86).</ref> Nevertheless Shakespeare escaped censure; and far from being suppressed, ''Hamlet'' was given the royal imprimatur, as the king's coat of arms on the [[frontispiece]] of the 1604 ''Hamlet'' attests.<ref>Matus (1994, 234<U+2013>237).</ref>

===Psychoanalytic===
[[Image:Claudius at Prayer Hamlet 3-3 Delacroix 1844.JPG|thumb|right|[[Sigmund Freud|Freud]] suggested that an [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] [[Oedipus complex|oedipal conflict]] caused Hamlet's hesitations. (Artist: [[Eug<U+00E8>ne Delacroix]] 1844).]]
Since the birth of [[psychoanalysis]] in the late 19th century, ''Hamlet'' has been the source of such studies, notably by [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Ernest Jones]], and [[Jacques Lacan]], which have influenced theatrical productions.

In his ''[[The Interpretation of Dreams]]'' (1900), Freud's analysis starts from the premise that "the play is built up on Hamlet's hesitations over fulfilling the task of revenge that is assigned to him; but its text offers no reasons or motives for these hesitations".<ref name="dreams">Freud (1900, 367).</ref> After reviewing various literary theories, Freud concludes that Hamlet has an "[[Oedipus complex|Oedipal desire]] for his mother and the subsequent guilt [is] preventing him from murdering the man [Claudius] who has done what he unconsciously wanted to do".<ref name="Britton">Britton (1995, 207-211).</ref> Confronted with his [[psychological repression|repressed desires]], Hamlet realises that "he himself is literally no better than the sinner whom he is to punish".<ref name="dreams"/> Freud suggests that Hamlet's apparent "distaste for sexuality"<U+2014>articulated in his "nunnery" conversation with Ophelia<U+2014>accords with this interpretation.<ref name="dream2">Freud (1900, 368).</ref><ref>The nunnery conversation referred to in this sentence is ''Hamlet'' 3.1.87<U+2013>160.</ref> [[John Barrymore]] introduced [[Sigmund Freud|Freudian]] overtones into his landmark 1922 production in New York, which ran for a record-breaking 101 nights.

In the 1940s, [[Ernest Jones]]<U+2014>a psychoanalyst and Freud's biographer<U+2014>developed Freud's ideas into a series of essays that culminated in his book ''Hamlet and Oedipus'' (1949). Influenced by Jones' psychoanalytic approach, several productions have portrayed the "closet scene",<ref>''The Closet Scene'': ''Hamlet'' 3.4.</ref> where Hamlet confronts his mother in her private quarters, in a sexual light. In this reading, Hamlet is disgusted by his mother's "incestuous" relationship with Claudius while simultaneously fearful of killing him, as this would clear Hamlet's path to his mother's bed. Ophelia's madness after her father's death may also be read through the Freudian lens: as a reaction to the death of her hoped-for lover, her father. She is overwhelmed by having her unfulfilled love for him so abruptly terminated and drifts into the oblivion of insanity.<ref>MacCary (1998, 104<U+2013>107, 113<U+2013>116) and de Grazia (2007, 168<U+2013>170).</ref> In 1937, [[Tyrone Guthrie]] directed [[Laurence Olivier]] in a Jones-inspired ''Hamlet'' at the [[Old Vic]].<ref>Smallwood (2002, 102).</ref> 

In the 1950s, [[Jacques Lacan|Lacan's]] [[structuralism|structuralist]] theories about ''Hamlet'' were first presented in a series of [[The Seminars of Jacques Lacan|seminars]] given in Paris and later published in "Desire and the Interpretation of Desire in ''Hamlet''". Lacan postulated that the human [[psyche (psychology)|psyche]] is determined by structures of language and that the linguistic structures of ''Hamlet'' shed light on human desire.<ref name="Britton"/> His point  of departure is Freud's Oedipal theories, and the central theme of mourning that runs through ''Hamlet''.<ref name="Britton"/> In Lacan's analysis, Hamlet unconsciously assumes the role of [[phallus#In pschoanalysis|''phallus'']]<U+2014>the cause of his inaction<U+2014>and is increasingly distanced from [[reality]] "by mourning, fantasy, [[narcissism (psychology)|narcissism]] and [[psychosis]]", which create holes (or "lacks") in the real, imaginary, and symbolic aspects of his psyche.<ref name="Britton"/> Lacan's theories influenced literary criticism of ''Hamlet'' because of his alternative vision of the play and his use of [[semantics]] to explore the play's psychological landscape.<ref name="Britton"/>

===Feminist===
[[Image:Ophelia - Henrietta Rae.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ophelia (character)|Ophelia]] is distracted by grief.<ref>''Hamlet'' 4.5.</ref> Feminist critics have explored her descent into madness. (Artist: Henrietta Rae 1890).]]

In the 20th century [[feminist literary criticism|feminist critics]] opened up new approaches to Gertrude and Ophelia. [[New Historicism|New Historicist]] and [[cultural materialism (cultural studies)|cultural materialist]] critics examined the play in its historical context, attempting to piece together its original cultural environment.<ref>Wofford (1994, 199<U+2013>202).</ref> They focused on the [[Gender role|gender system]] of [[early modern]] England, pointing to the common trinity of ''maid, wife, or widow'', with ''whores'' alone outside of the stereotype. In this analysis, the essence of ''Hamlet'' is the central character's changed perception of his mother as a whore because of her failure to remain faithful to Old Hamlet. In consequence, Hamlet loses his faith in all women, treating Ophelia as if she too were a whore.<ref>Howard (2003, 411<U+2013>415).</ref>

Carolyn Heilbrun's 1957 essay "Hamlet's Mother" defends Gertrude, arguing that the text never hints that Gertrude knew of Claudius poisoning King Hamlet. This analysis has been championed by many feminist critics. Heilbrun argued that men have for centuries completely misinterpreted Gertrude, accepting at face value Hamlet's view of her instead of following the actual text of the play. By this account, no clear evidence suggests that Gertrude is an adulteress: she is merely adapting to the circumstances of her husband's death for the good of the kingdom.<ref>Bloom (2003, 58<U+2013>59); Thompson (2001, 4).</ref>

Ophelia has also been defended by feminist critics, most notably [[Elaine Showalter]].<ref>Showalter (1985).</ref> Ophelia is surrounded by powerful men: her father, brother, and Hamlet. All three disappear: Laertes leaves, Hamlet abandons her, and Polonius dies. Conventional theories had argued that without these three powerful men making decisions for her, Ophelia is driven into madness.<ref>Bloom (2003, 57).</ref> Feminist theorists argue that she goes mad with guilt because, when Hamlet kills her father, he has fulfilled her sexual desire to have Hamlet kill her father so they can be together. Showalter points out that Ophelia has become<U+2014>inaccurately and inappropriately<U+2014>the symbol of the distraught and hysterical woman in modern culture.<ref>MacCary (1998, 111<U+2013>113).</ref>

==Influences==

:''See also [[#Stage and screen adaptations|Stage and screen adaptations]] (below), and [[Literary influence of Hamlet]]

''Hamlet'' is one of the [[Phrases from Hamlet in common English|most quoted]] works in the English language, and is often included on lists of the world's greatest literature.<ref>''Hamlet'' has 208 quotations in the ''[[Oxford Dictionary of Quotations]]''; it takes up 10 of 85 pages dedicated to Shakespeare in the 1986 ''[[Bartlett's Familiar Quotations|Bartlett's Familiar Quotations (14th ed. 1968)]]''. For examples of lists of the greatest books, see [[Harvard Classics]], [[Great Books]], [[Great Books of the Western World]], [[Harold Bloom]]'s ''The Western Canon'', [[St. John's College, U.S.#The Great Books|St. John's College reading list]], and [[Columbia College Core Curriculum]].</ref> As such, it reverberates through the writing of later centuries. Academic Laurie Osborne identifies the direct influence of ''Hamlet'' in numerous modern narratives, and divides them into four main categories: fictional accounts of the play's composition, simplifications of the story for young readers, stories expanding the role of one or more characters, and narratives featuring performances of the play.<ref>Osborne (2007, 114<U+2013>133 especially 115 and 120).</ref>

[[Henry Fielding]]'s ''[[The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling|Tom Jones]]'', published about 1749, describes a visit to ''Hamlet'' by Tom Jones and Mr Partridge, with similarities to the "play within a play".<ref name="T&T 123">Thompson and Taylor (2006a, 123<U+2013>126).</ref> In contrast, [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe's]] [[Bildungsroman]] ''[[Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship]]'', written between 1776 and 1796, not only has a production of ''Hamlet'' at its core but also creates parallels between the Ghost and Wilhelm Meister's dead father.<ref name="T&T 123"/> In the early 1850s, in ''[[Pierre: or, The Ambiguities|Pierre]]'', [[Hermann Melville]] focuses on a Hamlet-like character's long development as a writer.<ref name="T&T 123"/> Ten years later, [[Charles Dickens|Dickens']] ''[[Great Expectations]]'' contains many Hamlet-like plot elements: it is driven by revenge-motivated actions, contains ghost-like characters (Abel Magwich and [[Miss Havisham]]), and focuses on the hero's guilt.<ref name="T&T 123"/> Academic Alexander Welsh notes that ''Great Expectations'' is an "autobiographical novel" and "anticipates psychoanalytic readings of ''Hamlet'' itself".<ref>Welsh (2001, 131).</ref> About the same time, [[George Eliot]]'s ''[[The Mill on the Floss]]'' was published, introducing Maggie Tulliver "who is explicitly compared with Hamlet"<ref name="T&T 126">Thompson and Taylor (2006a, 126<U+2013>131).</ref> though "with a reputation for sanity".<ref name ="Novy">Novy (1994, 62, 77<U+2013>78).</ref>

In the 1920s, [[James Joyce]] managed "a more upbeat version" of ''Hamlet''<U+2014>stripped of obsession and revenge<U+2014>in ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'', though its main parallels are with [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]''.<ref name="T&T 123"/> In the 1990s, two women novelists were explicitly influenced by ''Hamlet''. In [[Angela Carter|Angela Carter's]] ''[[Wise Children]]'', ''To be or not to be''<ref>''Hamlet'' 3.1.55<U+2013>87.</ref> is reworked as a song and dance routine, and [[Iris Murdoch]]'s ''[[The Black Prince (novel)|The Black Prince]]'' has Oedipal themes and murder intertwined with a love affair between a ''Hamlet''-obsessed writer, Bradley Pearson, and the daughter of his rival.<ref name="T&T 126"/>

{{Main|Hamlet in performance|Shakespeare in performance}}

===Shakespeare's day to the Interregnum===
Shakespeare wrote the role of Hamlet for [[Richard Burbage]]. He was the chief tragedian of the [[Lord Chamberlain's Men]], with a capacious memory for lines and a wide emotional range.<ref name="gary"/> Judging by the number of reprints, ''Hamlet'' appears to have been Shakespeare's fourth most popular play during his lifetime<U+2014>only ''[[Henry VI, Part 1|Henry VI Part 1]]'', ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]'' and ''[[Pericles, Prince of Tyre|Pericles]]'' eclipsed it.<ref>Taylor (2002, 18).</ref> Shakespeare provides no clear indication of when his play is set; however, as Elizabethan actors performed at the [[Globe theatre|Globe]] in contemporary dress on minimal sets, this would not have affected the staging.<ref>Taylor (2002, 13).</ref> 

Firm evidence for specific early performances of the play is scant. What is known is that the crew of the ship ''Red Dragon'', anchored off [[Sierra Leone]], performed ''Hamlet'' in September 1607;<ref>Thompson and Taylor (2006a; 53<U+2013>55); Chambers (1930, vol.&nbsp;1, 334), cited by Dawson (2002, 176).</ref> that the play toured in [[Germany]] within five years of Shakespeare's death;<ref>Dawson (2002, 176).</ref> and that it was performed before [[James I of England|James I]] in 1619 and [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] in 1637.<ref>Pitcher and Woudhuysen (1969, 204).</ref> Oxford editor George Hibbard argues that, since the contemporary literature contains many allusions and references to ''Hamlet'' (only [[Falstaff]] is mentioned more, from Shakespeare), the play was surely performed with a frequency that the historical record misses.<ref>Hibbard (1987, 17).</ref>

All theatres were closed down by the [[Puritan]] government during the [[English Interregnum|Interregnum]].<ref>Marsden (2002, 21).</ref> Even during this time, however, playlets known as ''drolls'' were often performed illegally, including one called ''The Grave-Makers'' based on Act 5, Scene 1 of ''Hamlet''.<ref>Holland (2007, 34).</ref>

===Restoration and 18th century===
The play was revived early in the [[English Restoration|Restoration]]. When the existing stock of pre-[[English Civil War|civil war]] plays was divided between the two newly created [[Patent theatre|patent theatre companies]], ''Hamlet'' was the only Shakespearean favourite that [[William Davenant|Sir William Davenant's]] [[Duke's Company]] secured.<ref>Marsden (2002, 21<U+2013>22).</ref> It became the first of Shakespeare's plays to be presented with movable [[Flats (theatre)|flats]] painted with generic scenery behind the [[proscenium arch]] of [[Lincoln's Inn Fields|Lincoln's Inn Fields Theatre]].<ref>[[Samuel Pepys]] records his delight at the novelty of ''Hamlet'' "done with scenes"; see Thompson and Taylor (1996, 57).</ref> This new stage convention highlighted the frequency with which Shakespeare shifts dramatic location, encouraging the recurrent criticisms of his violation of the [[Neoclassicism|neoclassical]] principle of maintaining a [[Classical unities|unity of place]].<ref>Taylor (1989, 16).</ref> Davenant cast [[Thomas Betterton]] in the eponymous role, and he continued to play the Dane until he was 74.<ref>Thompson and Taylor (2006a, 98<U+2013>99).</ref> [[David Garrick]] at [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane|Drury Lane]] produced a version that adapted Shakespeare heavily; he declared: "I had sworn I would not leave the stage till I had rescued that noble play from all the rubbish of the fifth act. I have brought it forth without the grave-digger's trick, Osrick, & the fencing match".<ref>Letter to Sir William Young, [[10 January]] [[1773]], quoted by Uglow (1977, 473).</ref> The first actor known to have played Hamlet in North America is [[American Company|Lewis Hallam Jr]], in the American Company's production in Philadelphia in 1759.<ref>Morrison (2002, 231).</ref> 

[[Image:Garrick as Hamlet.jpg|thumb|left|[[David Garrick]]'s iconic hand gesture expresses Hamlet's shock at the first sight of the Ghost. (Artist: unknown).]]
[[John Philip Kemble]] made his Drury Lane debut as Hamlet in 1783.<ref>Moody (2002, 41).</ref> His performance was said to be 20 minutes longer than anyone else's, and his lengthy pauses provoked the suggestion that "music should be played between the words".<ref>Moody (2002, 44), quoting [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan|Sheridan]].</ref> [[Sarah Siddons]] was the first actress known to play Hamlet; many women have since played him as a [[breeches role]], to great acclaim.<ref>Gay (2002, 159).</ref> In 1748, [[Alexander Sumarokov]] wrote a Russian adaptation that focused on Prince Hamlet as the embodiment of an opposition to Claudius' tyranny<U+2014>a treatment that would recur in Eastern European versions into the 20th century.<ref>Dawson (2002, 185<U+2013>187).</ref> In the years following America's independence, [[Thomas Abthorpe Cooper]], the young nation's leading tragedian, performed ''Hamlet'' among other plays at the Chestnut Street Theatre in Philadelphia, and at the [[Park Theatre (Manhattan)|Park Theatre]] in New York. Although chided for "acknowledging acquaintances in the audience" and "inadequate memorisation of his lines", he became a national celebrity.<ref>Morrison (2002, 232<U+2013>233).</ref>

===19th century===

From around 1810 to 1840, the best-known Shakespearean performances in the United States were tours by leading London actors<U+2014>including [[George Frederick Cooke]], [[Junius Brutus Booth]], [[Edmund Kean]], [[William Charles Macready]], and [[Charles Kemble]]. Of these, Booth remained to make his career in the States, fathering the nation's most notorious actor, [[John Wilkes Booth]] (who later assassinated [[Abraham Lincoln]]), and its most famous Hamlet, [[Edwin Booth]].<ref>Morrison (2002, 235<U+2013>237).</ref> Edwin Booth's ''Hamlet'' was described as "like the dark, mad, dreamy, mysterious hero of a poem ... [acted] in an ideal manner, as far removed as possible from the plane of actual life".<ref>William Winter, ''[[New York Tribune]]'' 26 October 1875, quoted by Morrison (2002, 241).</ref> Booth played Hamlet for 100 nights in the 1864/5 season at the Winter Garden Theatre, inaugurating the era of long-run Shakespeare in America.<ref>Morrison (2002, 241).</ref> 

In the United Kingdom, the actor-managers of the [[Victorian era]] (including Kean, [[Samuel Phelps]], Macready, and [[Henry Irving]]) staged Shakespeare in a grand manner, with elaborate scenery and costumes.<ref>Schoch (2002, 58<U+2013>75).</ref> The tendency of actor-managers to emphasise the importance of their own central character did not always meet with the critics' approval. [[George Bernard Shaw|George Bernard Shaw's]] praise for [[Johnston Forbes-Robertson|Johnston Forbes-Robertson's]] performance ends with a sideswipe at Irving: "The story of the play was perfectly intelligible, and quite took the attention of the audience off the principal actor at moments. What is the [[Lyceum Theatre, London|Lyceum]] coming to?"<ref>[[George Bernard Shaw]] in ''The Saturday Review'' [[2 October]] [[1897]], quoted in Shaw (1961, 81).</ref>

In London, Edmund Kean was the first Hamlet to abandon the regal finery usually associated with the role in favour of a plain costume, and he is said to have surprised his audience by playing Hamlet as serious and introspective.<ref>Moody (2002, 54).</ref> In stark contrast to earlier opulence, [[William Poel|William Poel's]] 1881 production of the Q1 text was an early attempt at reconstructing the Elizabethan theatre's austerity; his only backdrop was a set of red curtains.<ref>Halliday (1964, 204) and O'Connor (2002, 77).</ref> [[Sarah Bernhardt]] played the prince in her popular 1899 London production. In contrast to the "effeminate" view of the central character that usually accompanied a female casting, she described her character as "manly and resolute, but nonetheless thoughtful ... [he] thinks before he acts, a trait indicative of great strength and great spiritual power".<ref>[[Sarah Bernhardt]], in a letter to the London ''[[The Daily Telegraph|Daily Telegraph]]'', quoted by Gay (2002, 164).</ref>

In France, Charles Kemble initiated an enthusiasm for Shakespeare; and leading members of the Romantic movement such as [[Victor Hugo]] and [[Alexandre Dumas, p<U+00E8>re|Alexandre Dumas]] saw his 1827 Paris performance of ''Hamlet'', particularly admiring the madness of [[Harriet Smithson|Harriet Smithson's]] Ophelia.<ref>Holland (2002, 203<U+2013>205).</ref> In Germany, ''Hamlet'' had become so assimilated by the mid-19th century that [[Ferdinand Freiligrath]] declared that "Germany is Hamlet".<ref>Dawson (2002, 184).</ref> From the 1850s, the [[Parsi]] theatre tradition in India transformed ''Hamlet'' into folk performances, with dozens of songs added.<ref>Dawson (2002, 188).</ref>

===20th century===
Apart from some western troupes' 19th-century visits, the first professional performance of Hamlet in Japan was [[Otojiro Kawakami|Otojiro Kawakami's]] 1903 ''Shimpa'' ("new school theatre") adaptation.<ref name="Gillies 259">Gillies ''et al'' (2002, 259<U+2013>262).</ref> [[Tsubouchi Shoyo|Shoyo Tsubouchi]] translated ''Hamlet'' and produced a performance in 1911 that blended ''Shingeki'' ("new drama") and ''[[Kabuki]]'' styles.<ref name="Gillies 259"/> This hybrid-genre reached its peak in [[Fukuda Tsuneari|Fukuda Tsuneari's]] 1955 ''Hamlet''.<ref name="Gillies 259"/> In 1998, [[Yukio Ninagawa]] produced an acclaimed version of ''Hamlet'' in the style of [[Noh|N<U+014D>]] theatre, which he took to London.<ref>Dawson (2002, 180).</ref>

[[Image:Craig's design (1908) for Hamlet 1-2 at Moscow Art Theatre.jpg|thumb|right|In 1908, [[Edward Gordon Craig]] designed the [[Moscow Art Theatre|MAT]] [[The MAT production of Hamlet|production of ''Hamlet'']] (1911<U+2013>12). The isolated figure of Hamlet reclines in the dark foreground, while behind a [[Scrim (material)|gauze]] the rest of the court are absorbed in a bright, unified golden pyramid emanating from Claudius. Craig's famous screens are flat against the back in this scene.]]

[[Constantin Stanislavski]] and [[Edward Gordon Craig]]<U+2014>two of the 20th century's most influential [[theatre practitioners]]<U+2014>collaborated on the [[Moscow Art Theatre|Moscow Art Theatre's]] seminal [[The MAT production of Hamlet|production of 1911<U+2013>12]].<ref>For more on this production, see [[The MAT production of Hamlet|The MAT production of ''Hamlet'']]. [[Edward Gordon Craig|Craig]] and [[Constantin Stanislavski|Stanislavski]] began planning the production in 1908 but, due to a serious illness of Stanislavski's, it was delayed until December, 1911. See Benedetti (1998, 188<U+2013>211).</ref> While Craig favoured stylised abstraction, Stanislavski, armed with his [[Stanislavski's 'system'|"system"]], explored psychological motivation.<ref>Benedetti (1999, 189, 195).</ref> Craig conceived of the play as a [[Russian symbolism|symbolist]] [[monodrama]], offering a dream-like vision as seen through Hamlet's eyes alone.<ref>On Craig's relationship to [[Russian symbolism]] and its principles of [[monodrama]] in particular, see Taxidou (1998, 38<U+2013>41); on Craig's staging proposals, see Innes (1983, 153); on the centrality of the protagonist and his mirroring of the 'authorial self', see Taxidou (1998, 181, 188) and Innes (1983, 153).</ref> This was most evident in the staging of the first court scene.<ref>''The First Court Scene'': ''Hamlet'' 1.2.1<U+2013>128.</ref><ref>A brightly lit, golden pyramid descended from Claudius' throne, representing the [[Feudalism|feudal hierarchy]], giving the illusion of a single, unified mass of bodies. In the dark, shadowy foreground, separated by a [[Scrim (material)|gauze]], Hamlet lay, as if dreaming. On Claudius' exit-line the figures remained but the gauze was loosened, so that they appeared to melt away as if Hamlet's thoughts had turned elsewhere. For this effect, the scene received an [[standing ovation|ovation]], which was unheard of at the [[Moscow Art Theatre|MAT]]. See Innes (1983, 152).</ref> The most famous aspect of the production is Craig's use of large, abstract screens that altered the size and shape of the acting area for each scene, representing the character's state of mind spatially or visualising a [[Dramaturgy|dramaturgical]] progression.<ref>See Innes (1983, 140<U+2013>175; esp. 165<U+2013>167 on the use of the screens).</ref> The production attracted enthusiastic and unprecedented worldwide attention for the theatre and placed it "on the cultural map for Western Europe".<ref>Innes (1983, 172).</ref>

''Hamlet'' is often played with contemporary political overtones. [[Leopold Jessner|Leopold Jessner's]] 1926 production at the Berlin Staatstheater portrayed Claudius' court as a parody of the corrupt and fawning court of [[William II, German Emperor|Kaiser Wilhelm]].<ref>Hortmann (2002, 214).</ref>  In [[Poland]], the number of productions of ''Hamlet'' has tended to increase at times of political unrest, since its political themes (suspected crimes, coups, surveillance) can be used to comment on a contemporary situation.<ref>Hortmann (2002, 223).</ref> Similarly, [[Czech Republic|Czech]] directors have used the play at times of occupation: a 1941 [[Vinohrady|Vinohrady Theatre]] production "emphasised, with due caution, the helpless situation of an intellectual attempting to endure in a ruthless environment".<ref>Burian (1993), quoted by Hortmann (2002, 224<U+2013>225).</ref> In [[China]], performances of Hamlet often have political significance: Gu Wuwei's 1916 ''The Usurper of State Power'', an amalgam of ''Hamlet'' and ''Macbeth'', was an attack on [[Yuan Shikai|Yuan Shikai's]] attempt to overthrow the republic.<ref name = "Gillies 267">Gillies ''et al.'' (2002, 267<U+2013>269).</ref> In 1942, Jiao Juyin directed the play in a [[Confucianism|Confucian]] temple in [[Sichuan|Sichuan Province]], to which the government had retreated from the advancing [[Japan]]ese.<ref name = "Gillies 267"/> In the immediate aftermath of the collapse of the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|protests]] at [[Tiananmen Square]], Lin Zhaohua staged a 1990 ''Hamlet'' in which the prince was an ordinary individual tortured by a loss of meaning. In this production, the actors playing Hamlet, Claudius and Polonius exchanged roles at crucial moments in the performance, including the moment of Claudius' death, at which point the actor mainly associated with Hamlet fell to the ground.<ref name = "Gillies 267"/>

Notable London stagings include Barrymore's 1925 production at the [[Haymarket Theatre|Haymarket]]; it greatly influenced subsequent performances by [[John Gielgud]] and [[Laurence Olivier]].<ref>Morrison (2002, 247<U+2013>248); Thompson and Taylor (2006a, 109).</ref> Gielgud played the central role many times: his 1936 New York production ran for 136 performances, leading to the accolade that he was "the finest interpreter of the role since Barrymore".<ref>Morrison (2002, 249).</ref> Although "posterity has treated [[Maurice Evans (actor)|Maurice Evans]] less kindly", throughout the 1930s and 1940s it was he, not Gielgud or Olivier, who was regarded as the leading interpreter of Shakespeare in the United States and in the 1938/9 season he presented Broadway's first uncut ''Hamlet'', running four and a half hours.<ref>Morrison (2002, 249<U+2013>250).</ref> In 1963, Olivier directed [[Peter O'Toole]] as Hamlet in the landmark inaugural performance of the newly formed [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]]; critics found resonance between O'Toole's Hamlet and [[John Osborne|John Osborne's]] hero, Jimmy Porter, from ''[[Look Back in Anger]]''.<ref>Smallwood (2002, 108); [http://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/?lid=2879&dspl=reviews National Theatre reviews] Retrieved: [[4 December]] 2007.</ref>

===Screen performances===

{{main|Hamlet on screen}}
The earliest screen success for ''Hamlet'' was [[Sarah Bernhardt|Sarah Bernhardt's]] five-minute film of the fencing scene,<ref>''The Fencing Scene'': ''Hamlet'' 5.2.203<U+2013>387.</ref> produced in 1900. The film was a crude [[talkie]], in that music and words were recorded on phonograph records, to be played along with the film.<ref name = "Brode 117">Brode (2001, 117<U+2013>118).</ref> Silent versions were released in 1907, 1908, 1910, 1913, and 1917.<ref name = "Brode 117"/> In 1920, [[Asta Nielsen]] played Hamlet as a woman who spends her life disguised as a man.<ref name = "Brode 117"/> [[Laurence Olivier|Laurence Olivier's]] 1948 ''[[film noir]]'' ''[[Hamlet (1948 film)|Hamlet]]'' won [[Academy Award for Best Picture|best picture]] and [[Academy Award for Best Actor|best actor]] [[Academy Awards|Oscars]]. His interpretation stressed the Oedipal overtones of the play, to the extent of casting the 28-year-old [[Eileen Herlie]] as Hamlet's mother, opposite himself, at 41, as Hamlet.<ref>Davies (2000, 171).</ref> ''[[Hamlet (1964 film)|Gamlet]]'' ({{lang-ru|''<U+0413><U+0430><U+043C><U+043B><U+0435><U+0442>''}}) is a 1964 film adaptation in [[Russian language|Russian]], based on a translation by [[Boris Pasternak]] and directed by [[Grigori Kozintsev]], with a score by [[Dmitri Shostakovich]].<ref>Guntner (2000, 120<U+2013>121).</ref> [[John Gielgud]] directed [[Richard Burton]] at the [[Lunt-Fontanne Theatre]] in 1964<U+2013>5, and a [[Richard Burton's Hamlet|film of a live performance]] was produced, in <small>''ELECTRONOVISION''</small>.<ref>Brode (2001, 125<U+2013>127).</ref> [[Franco Zeffirelli|Franco Zeffirelli's]] Shakespeare films have been described as "sensual rather than cerebral": his aim to make Shakespeare "even more popular".<ref>Both quotations from Cartmell (2000, 212), where the aim of making Shakespeare "even more popular" is attributed to Zeffirelli himself in an interview given to [[The South Bank Show]] in December 1997.</ref> To this end, he cast the Australian actor [[Mel Gibson]]<U+2014>then famous as [[Mad Max]]<U+2014>in the title role of his [[Hamlet (1990 film)|1990 version]], and [[Glenn Close]]<U+2014>then famous as the psychotic ''other woman'' in ''[[Fatal Attraction]]''<U+2014>as Gertrude.<ref>Guntner (2000, 121<U+2013>122).</ref>

In contrast to Zeffirelli, whose ''Hamlet'' was heavily cut, [[Kenneth Branagh]] adapted, directed, and starred in a 1996 version containing every word of Shakespeare's play, combining the material from the F1 and Q2 texts. Branagh's [[Hamlet (1996 film)|''Hamlet'']] runs for around four hours.<ref>Crowl (2000, 232).</ref>  Branagh set the film with late 19th-century costuming and furnishings;<ref>Starks (1999, 272).</ref> and [[Blenheim Palace]], built in the early 18th century, became Elsinore Castle in the external scenes. The film is structured as an [[Epic film|epic]] and makes frequent use of [[flashback]]s to highlight elements not made explicit in the play: Hamlet's sexual relationship with [[Kate Winslet|Kate Winslet's]] Ophelia, for example, or his childhood affection for Yorick (played by [[Ken Dodd]]).<ref>Keyishian (2000, 78<U+2013>79).</ref> In 2000, [[Michael Almereyda|Michael Amereyda's]] ''[[Hamlet (2000 film)|Hamlet]]'' set the story in contemporary [[Manhattan]], with [[Ethan Hawke]] playing Hamlet as a film student. Claudius became the [[CEO]] of "Denmark Corporation", having taken over the company by killing his brother.<ref>Burnett (2000).</ref>

===Stage and screen adaptations===

{{see|References to Hamlet}}
''Hamlet'' has been adapted into stories that deal with civil corruption by the [[West Germany|West German]] director [[Helmut K<U+00E4>utner]] in ''Der Rest ist Schweigen'' (''The Rest is Silence'') and by the Japanese director [[Akira Kurosawa]] in ''Warui Yatsu Hodo Yoku Nemeru'' (''[[The Bad Sleep Well]]'').<ref>Howard (2000, 300<U+2013>301).</ref> In [[Claude Chabrol|Claude Chabrol's]] ''Oph<U+00E9>lia'' (France, 1962) the central character, Yvan, watches Olivier's ''Hamlet'' and convinces himself<U+2014>wrongly and with tragic results<U+2014>that he is in Hamlet's situation.<ref>Howard (2000, 301<U+2013>302).</ref> [[Tom Stoppard|Tom Stoppard's]] play, ''[[Rosencrantz & Guildenstern Are Dead]]'' (which has a [[Rosencrantz & Guildenstern Are Dead (film)|1990 film version]]), portrays the events of ''Hamlet'' from the perspective of Hamlet's two school friends, recasting it as the tragedy of two minor characters who must die to fulfil their role in a drama that they do not understand. In 1977, East German playwright [[Heiner M<U+00FC>ller]] wrote ''Die Hamletmaschine'' (''[[Hamletmachine]]'') a [[Postmodernism|postmodernist]], condensed version of ''Hamlet''; this adaptation was subsequently incorporated into his translation of Shakespeare's play in his 1989/1990 production ''[[Hamlet/Machine (adaptation)|Hamlet/Maschine]]'' (''Hamlet/Machine'').<ref>Teraoka (1985, 13).</ref> The highest-grossing ''Hamlet'' adaptation to date is [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney's]] [[Academy Award]]-winning animated feature ''[[The Lion King]]'', which enacts a loose version of the plot among a pride of African lions.<ref>Vogler (1992, 267<U+2013>275).</ref>
