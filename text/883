The '''Hooded Crow''' (''Corvus cornix'') (sometimes called '''Hoodiecrow''') is a [[Eurasia]]n bird species in the [[crow]] [[genus (biology)|genus]]. Widely distributed, it is also known locally as <!-- '''Militia Crow''' or '''Militia Bird''' in [[Russia]]{{specify}} as its colour pattern resembles police uniform, --> '''Scotch Crow''', '''Danish Crow''', and '''Grey Crow''' in [[Ireland]], which is what its Welsh name, '''[http://cy.wikipedia.org/wiki/Br%C3%A2n_Lwyd Br<U+00E2>n Lwyd]''', translates as. Found across northern, eastern and southeastern Europe, and the middle east, it is a ashy grey bird with black head, throat, wings, tail and thigh feathers, as well as a black bill, eyes and feet. Like other corvids it is an omnivorous and opportunistic forager and feeder.

It is so similar in morphology and habits to the [[Carrion Crow]] (''Corvus corone'') that for many years they were considered by most authorities to be merely geographical races of one species. The fact that hybridization was observed where their ranges overlapped added weight to this view. However, since 2002, the Hooded Crow has been elevated to full species status after closer observation; the hybridisation was less than expected and hybrids had decreased vigour. Within the Hooded Crow species itself, four subspecies are recognized, with one, the Mesopotamian Crow, possibly distinct enough to warrant species status itself.

==Taxonomy==
The Hooded Crow was one of the many species originally described by [[Carolus Linnaeus|Linnaeus]] in his 18th century work ''[[Systema Naturae]]'' and it once again bears its original name of ''Corvus cornix''.<ref>{{la icon}} {{cite book  | last=Linnaeus | first=C | authorlink=Carolus Linnaeus  | title=Systema naturae per regna tria naturae, secundum classes, ordines, genera, species, cum characteribus, differentiis, synonymis, locis.

===Subspecies===
Four subspecies of the Hooded Crow are now recognised; previously all were considered subspecies of ''Corvus corone''. A fifth, ''Corvus cornix sardonius'' (Trischitta, 1939) has been listed though it has been alternately partitioned between ''C. c. sharpii'' (most populations), ''C. c. cornix''  (Corsican population) and the [[Middle East]]ern ''C. c. pallescens''.

*'''''C. c. cornix''''', the nominate race, occurs in the British Isles (principally Scotland and Ireland) and Europe, south to [[Corsica]]. 
*'''''C. c. pallescens''''' (Madar<U+00E1>sz, 1904) is found in [[Turkey]] and [[Egypt]], and is a paler form as its name suggests. 
*'''''C. c. sharpii ''''' (Oates, 1889) is named for [[England|English]] [[zoology|zoologist]] [[Richard Bowdler Sharpe]]. This is a paler grey form found from western [[Siberia]] through to the [[Caucasus]] region and [[Iran]].<ref name="CotW83"> {{cite book|author=Goodwin D.|year=1983|title=Crows of the World |publisher=Queensland University Press, St Lucia, Qld|id=ISBN 0-7022-1015-3}}</ref>
*'''''C. c. capellanus''''' (P.L. Sclater, 1877) is known as the '''Mesopotamian Crow''' or '''Iraqi Pied Crow'''. This distinctive form occurs in [[Iraq]] and southwestern [[Iran]]. It has very pale grey plumage which looks almost white from a distance.<ref name="CotW83"/> It is possibly distinct enough to be considered a separate species.<ref name = "Madge94">Madge, Steve & Burn, Hilary (1994): ''Crows and jays: a guide to the crows, jays and magpies of the world''. A&C Black, London. ISBN 0-7136-3999-7</ref>

==Description==
Except for the head, throat, wings, tail and thigh feathers, which are black and mostly glossy, the plumage is ash-grey, the dark shafts giving it a streaky appearance. The bill and legs are black; the iris dark brown. There is only one moult in autumn, as in other crow species. The male is the larger bird, otherwise the sexes are alike. The flight is slow and heavy and usually straight. The length varies from 48 to 52&nbsp;cm (19-20&nbsp;in). When first hatched the young are much blacker than the parents. Juveniles have duller plumage with bluish or greyish eyes and initially a red mouth. Wingspan is 98 cm (39 in) and weight is on average 510 grammes.<ref name = BTO>{{cite web|title= Hooded Crow   '' Corvus cornix'' [Linnaeus, 1758] |work= BTO''Web'' BirdFacts|url= http://blx1.bto.org/birdfacts/results/bob15673.htm |publisher=British Trust for Ornithology |accessdate=2008-02-04}}</ref>

The Hooded Crow, with its contrasted greys and blacks, cannot be confused with either the Carrion Crow or [[rook (bird)|Rook]], but the ''kraa'' call notes of the two are almost indistinguishable.<ref name= Collins>Mullarney, Killian; Svensson, Lars, Zetterstrom, Dan; Grant, Peter. (2001). ''Birds of Europe.'' Princeton University Press. 336 ISBN 0691050546</ref>

==Distribution and habitat==
The Hooded Crow breeds in northern and eastern [[Europe]], and closely allied forms inhabit southern Europe and western [[Asia]]. Where its range overlaps with Carrion Crow, as in northern [[Great Britain|Britain]], [[Germany]], [[Denmark]], northern [[Italy]] and [[Siberia]], their hybrids are fertile. However, the hybrids are less well-adapted than pure-bred birds, and this is one of the reasons that this species was split from the Carrion Crow.<ref>Jones, Steve (1999): ''Almost Like A Whale: The Origin Of Species Updated''.  Doubleday, Garden City. ISBN 978-0385409858</ref> There are some areas, such as Iran and central Russia, where little or no interbreeding occurs. 

In the [[British Isles]], the Hooded Crow breeds regularly in [[Scotland]], the [[Isle of Man]], and in the Scottish Islands. It also breeds widely in Ireland. In autumn some [[bird migration|migratory]] [[bird]]s arrive on the east coast of [[Great Britain|Britain]]. In the past, this was a more common visitor, and in [[Hertfordshire]] was known as the '''Royston Crow''' after the town of [[Royston, Hertfordshire|Royston]]. The 150-year old local newspaper is still titled ''Royston Crow'', and depicts the bird<U+2019>s head on its masthead.<ref name= Cocker >{{cite book | last = Cocker | first = Mark | coauthors= Mabey, Richard  |title = Birds Britannica | year = 2005 |location=London | publisher = Chatto & Windus | isbn = 0-7011-6907-9 | pages =418-425|}} </ref>

==Behaviour==
===Diet===
[[Image:CrowWastebag.jpg|thumb|left|Hooded crow searching for food from punctured wastebag]]
The Hooded Crow is omnivorous, with a diet similar to that of the Carrion Crow, and is a constant scavenger. It drops [[mollusc]]s and [[crab]]s to break them after the manner of the Carrion Crow, and an old [[Scotland|Scottish]] name for empty [[sea urchin]] shells was "crow's cups".<ref name = Cocker/> On coastal cliffs the eggs of [[gull]]s, [[Great Cormorant|cormorant]]s and other birds are stolen when their owners are absent, and it will enter the burrow of the [[Atlantic Puffin|Puffin]] to steal eggs.

===Nesting===
[[Image:Corvus cornix nest.jpg|right|thumb|Nest with eggs]]
Nesting occurs later in colder regions: mid-May to mid-June in northwest [[Russia]], [[Shetland Islands|Shetland]] and the [[Faroe Islands]], and late February in the [[Persian Gulf]] region.<ref name="CotW83"/> In warmer parts of the British Isles, the clutch is laid in April.<ref name=Observerbirdseggs>{{cite book |title=The Observer's Book of Birds' Eggs|author=Evans G|pages=p. 18|year=1972 |publisher=Warne |location=London |isbn=0-7232-0060-2}}</ref> The bulky stick nest is normally placed in a tall tree, but cliff ledges, old buildings and pylons may be used. Nests are occasionally placed on or near the ground. The nest resembles that of the Carrion Crow, but on the coast seaweed is often interwoven in the structure, and animal bones and wire are also frequently incorporated.<ref name= Cocker/><ref name= BWP/> The four to six brown-speckled blue eggs are 4.3 x 3.0&nbsp;centimetres (1.7 x 1.2&nbsp;in) in size and weigh 19.8&nbsp;grammes (0.71&nbsp;oz), of which 6% is shell.<ref name= BTO/> The [[altricial]] young are incubated for 17-19 days&nbsp;by the female alone, who is fed by the male. They fledge after 32-36&nbsp;days. Incubating females have been reported to obtain most of their own food and later that for their young.<ref>Yom-Tov, Y. (1974) The effect of food and predation on breeding density and success, clutch size and laying date of the crow ''Corvus corone''. ''J. Anim. Ecol.'' '''43''', 479-498</ref>  

The typical lifespan is unknown, but that of the Carrion crow is four years.<ref name = BTO2>{{cite web|title= Carrion Crow   '' Corvus corone'' [Linnaeus, 1758] |work= BTO''Web'' BirdFacts|url= http://blx1.bto.org/birdfacts/results/bob15671.htm |publisher=British Trust for Ornithology |accessdate=2008-02-04}}</ref> The maximum recorded age for a Hooded Crow is 16 years 9 months.<ref name = BTO/> 
		 
This species is a secondary host of the [[brood parasite|parasitic]] [[Great Spotted Cuckoo]], the [[European Magpie]] being the preferred host. However, in areas where the latter species is absent, such as [[Israel]] and [[Egypt]], the Hooded crow becomes the normal corvid host.<ref name=BWP2>Snow & Perrin (1998) 873-4</ref>

This species, like its relative, is seen regularly killed by farmers and grouse estates. In [[Cork, Ireland]] the county's gun clubs shot 23,000 Hooded Crows in two years in the early 1980s.<ref name= Cocker/>

==Status==
The [[IUCN Red List]] does not distinguish the Hooded Crow from the Carrion Crow, but the two species together have an extensive range, estimated at 10&nbsp;million&nbsp;square kilometres (3.8&nbsp;million square miles), and a large population, including an estimated 14 to 34 million individuals in Europe alone. They are not believed to approach the thresholds for the population decline criterion of the IUCN Red List (i.e., declining more than 30% in ten years or three generations), and are therefore evaluated as [[Least Concern]].<ref name=BTO/><ref name= IUCN>{{IUCN2006|assessors=BirdLife International|year=2004|id=51164|title=Corvus corone|downloaded=05 May 2006}} Database entry includes justification for why this species is of least concern</ref> The Carrion Crow/Hooded Crow hybrid zone is slowly spreading northwest, but the Hooded Crow has of the order of three million territories in just Europe (excluding Russia).<ref name=BWP>{{cite book | last = Snow   | first =  David  |coauthors= Perrins, Christopher M  (editors)| title = The Birds of the Western Palearctic concise edition (2 volumes) | publisher = Oxford University Press |year = 1998| location =Oxford | isbn = 0-19-854099-X |pages = 1478-1480}}</ref>
