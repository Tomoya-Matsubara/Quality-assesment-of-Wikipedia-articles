{{Nihongo|'''Eureka'''|<U+30A8><U+30A6><U+30EC><U+30AB>}} is the female protagonist of the ''Eureka Seven'' series. She is referred to in episode previews simply as "the girl".

==Character outline==
Eureka is a girl created by the [[Eureka Seven#Scub Coral|Scub Coral]]. She has pale skin, medium-length turquoise hair, and lavender eyes, and wears a blue and white one-piece dress. Eureka is a member of [[Eureka Seven#Characters|Gekkostate]] and the pilot of the [[List of Eureka Seven mecha#Nirvash typeZERO|Nirvash typeZERO]], which she treats as an intelligent being and companion rather than a machine. She suffers from frequent headaches, which stop after [[Renton Thurston|Renton]] arrives, but later restart as her connection with the typeZERO becomes strained. Eureka goes through a physical and emotional change after she comes in contact with the Scub Coral at the LFO dig site. Later in the series it is revealed that she was sent by the Scub Coral in human form to gather information about the human race. She was given no prior knowledge of humans or her own identity before the time of her discovery.

==Relationships==
===Renton Thurston===
Renton is Eureka's partner and the main protagonist of the series. Renton and Eureka's relationship goes through many changes throughout the story. It begins with Renton having a crush on Eureka, who crashes into [[List of Eureka Seven characters#Axel Thurston|Axel Thurston's]] garage. She is one of the main reasons that Renton joins Gekkostate. Over time, Renton starts to understand how his role affects Eureka and the typeZERO. It is because of his relationship with Eureka that many of the seemingly miraculous events in the series occur, such as going to Earth and eventually saving the world from the [[Eureka Seven#Terminology|Limit of Questions]].

===Maurice, Maeter, and Linck===
[[List of Eureka Seven characters#Maurice, Maeter, and Linck|Maurice, Maeter, and Linck]] are children rescued from Ciudades del Cielo while Eureka and [[List of Eureka Seven characters#Holland Novak|Holland]] were still in the Special Forces. Before Renton serves as a male role model for the kids and shows Eureka how to discipline them, they are often unruly and disobedient. They tease Renton and sometimes cause trouble for Gekkostate.

===Holland Novak===
Eureka joined Holland's Special Forces squad when she was found next to the typeZERO and proved to be the perfect pilot for it. Holland thinks of himself as Eureka's partner, but [[List of Eureka Seven characters#Norb|Norb]] states that Eureka will have a partner other than Holland and [[List of Eureka Seven characters#Colonel Dewey Novak|Dewey]]. He says that her true partner will be the boy that can make her smile from her heart. Still, Holland protects Eureka from harm and does not accept Renton as her partner until season three.

===The Thurston family===
After Eureka was found, Axel Thurston took part in building new technologies for the typeZERO. [[List of Eureka Seven characters#Adroc Thurston|Adroc Thurston]] assists Eureka until his mysterious disappearance (he is later revealed to have been with the Scub Corals). Renton also introduces Eureka to his sister, [[List of Eureka Seven characters#Diane Thurston|Diane Thurston]], later in the series. Eureka is listed as "Eureka Thurston" in the family record book that Axel is reading at the end of episode 50.<ref name="ep50" />

===Gekkostate===
Eureka has special status in Gekkostate as a skilled pilot and one of the organization's original members.<ref>{{cite web | title = Eureka Seven | url = http://eurekaseven.bandai-ent.com/ | publisher = Bandai | accessdate = May 29, 2009}}</ref> She is respected in Gekkostate for her partnership with Holland and later Renton, and for her role as adoptive mother to Maurice, Maeter, and Linck.

==Manga==
Eureka Seven is not similar in the manga version as in the anime version. In the manga version the story ends with Eureka being in the Zone and Anemone using Nirvash "typeTHEEND" to implement a virus program into the Coralians. Dominic also helps Renton in efforts to stop the virus and saving the ones they care the most. Like the anime Renton was able to profess his love toward Eureka, however, Eureka vanished with the Coralians. Renton lives with Eureka's adopted children Maurice, Maeter, and Linck and his grandfather Axel Thurston in Bellforest. Renton works on the windmill and anticipates on Eureka's return, denying any possibility that Eureka is dead.<ref name="Psalms of Planets: Eureka seveN Vol. 6">{{cite book | title =Eureka seveN Vol. 6 | publisher =Bandai}}</ref>

==Movie==
Renton and Eureka meet as young children and become fast friends. She can't go outside in the daytime because the sun's light burns her skin, which reveals a green underlayer. They went with Professor Dominic to see a rainbow flower one evening, but their happiness is temporary, for the military arrives soon after and abducts Eureka, leaving Renton distraught. Eight years later, Renton, now a child soldier and KLF pilot, finds Eureka and saves her. Holland then reveals that Eureka is the military's top secret project, and she further elaborates to Renton that she is a spy robot that the Image created to spy on humankind, and that she would likely die young (her remaining life was denoted by the red ring in her eyes, which by then resembled a crescent and would shrink as her life faded). After Renton sustains a gunshot to the abdomen, Eureka vows to have a future with Renton, which angered the Gekkostate to kill an elder Anemone to stop their plans. Then an EIZO hand attacks her and Anemone only for Renton and an evolved Nirvash - the pure one - to rescue her. They escape only for Holland to follow and attack them. They manage to escape Holland, but Renton succumbs to his injuries. Eureka confesses her love to the unconscious Renton and bids him farewell, believing they will meet again as long as he survives. Then Nirvash pierced the command cluster just seconds before "The Hammer of God" strikes it. The planet is then flooded when "Image" turns into water. When Renton wakes up on the coastal area of his homeland Warsaw, he sees a naked Eureka with long hair and she is incapable of speech due to a complete loss of memory, but is no longer affected by the Sun. His wound is completely gone, and a large Larva Nirvash appears before them. Before Nirvash disappears into light fragments, he told Renton that he and Eureka can fly now even without wings and that their own two feet will carry themselves to the future. Renton clothed Eureka with his jacket and she points out a rainbow and an incoming space shuttle. Eureka then kisses Renton on the left side of his face and hold his hands dearly, implying their happiness ever after. 

Note that this is the only version of the story that Eureka has turned into an ordinary human being, noted by the absence of the red ring on her eyes, as well as her continued existence despite the vanishing of her creator "Image" which caused Anemone and Nirvash to follow suit (contrary to the manga ending).

==Reception==
Eureka was ranked 18th in the female character category of the [[Anime Grand Prix]] in 2005.<ref>{{cite web | title=The 28th Anime Grand Prix | url=http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=ja&tl=en&u=http://animage.jp/gp/gp_new.html | publisher=Animage | accessdate=May 30, 2009}}</ref>

In his review of the series' first DVD, Theron Martin of [[Anime News Network]] described Eureka as "calm, sensible, and soft-spoken but not necessarily shy...and is quite capable of showing joy, sadness, or earnestness without resorting to the exaggerated expressions and reactions so common in anime."<ref>{{cite web | first = Theron | last = Martin | title = Eureka 7 DVD 1 - Review | url = http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/eureka-7/dvd-1 | publisher = Anime News Network | date = June 30, 2006 | accessdate = May 21, 2009}}</ref> Martin also said in his review of the sixth DVD that "Eureka is hardly the first person in an anime series who struggles to understand and cope with...love, but she does it more convincingly than most."<ref>{{cite web | first = Theron | last = Martin | title = Eureka 7 DVD 6 - Review | url = http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/eureka-7/dvd-6 | publisher = Anime News Network | date = March 28, 2007 | accessdate = May 21, 2009}}</ref>
