'''Hunts Cross railway station''' is a [[railway station]] in [[Hunts Cross]], [[Liverpool]], [[England]].  It is situated on the southern branch of the [[City Line (Merseyrail)|City Line]]'s [[Liverpool to Manchester Line|Liverpool to Manchester]] route, and is the southern terminus of [[Merseyrail]]'s [[Northern Line (Merseyrail)|Northern Line]].

==History==
Originally built by the [[Cheshire Lines Committee]], Hunts Cross was the only four-platform station on the line running between [[Liverpool Central]] and [[Manchester Central]] stations.   It was also a junction at the southern end of the [[North Liverpool Extension Line]] to [[Gateacre railway station|Gateacre]], [[West Derby]], north [[Port of Liverpool|Liverpool docks]] and [[Southport]].   This line was closed in stages from [[1952]] to [[1972]] and is now part of [[National Cycle Network]] Route 62, the [[Trans Pennine Trail]]. The closure of the North Liverpool route left Hunts Cross to be served by the local service from [[Liverpool Lime Street railway station|Liverpool Lime Street]] to [[Warrington]] and [[Manchester]].

In [[1983]] Merseyrail's electrified Northern Line from [[Liverpool Central railway station|Liverpool Central]] was extended to Hunts Cross from its previous terminus at [[Garston (Merseyside) railway station|Garston]]. One of the former Gateacre line platforms was reinstated as a bay platform for terminating electric services. Northern Line trains originally ran through to [[Kirkby railway station|Kirkby]], but in [[1984]] the timetable was altered and trains continued to [[Southport railway station|Southport]] instead.

When the Merseyrail service was introduced, the service from [[Liverpool Lime Street railway station|Liverpool Lime Street]] to [[Manchester]] was cut back to terminate at Hunts Cross. Passengers from Manchester wishing to continue to Liverpool had to change to a Merseyrail train. This arrangement was short-lived and ended in [[1989]] when the through trains to Lime Street were restored.

From [[11 June]] [[2006]], the number of Manchester-bound trains stopping at Hunts Cross was reduced from two trains per hour to one. However, during morning and evening peaks the half-hourly frequency is still maintained.

From [[11 December]] [[2006]], the Monday-Saturday evening Northern Line service was increased to run every 15 minutes. Previously, services had reduced to a half-hourly frequency after 7.30pm.

==Current services==

{{clear}}
Hunts Cross station currently has three operational platforms. 
#[[Northern Rail]] services bound for Liverpool Lime Street (Merseyrail City Line).
#[[Northern Rail]] services bound for [[Warrington Central railway station|Warrington Central]] and [[Manchester Oxford Road railway station|Manchester Oxford Road]] (Merseyrail City Line).
#[[Merseyrail]] services bound for [[Liverpool Central railway station|Liverpool Central]] and [[Southport railway station|Southport]] (Merseyrail Northern Line).

The track serving platform 2 is also electrified and can be used by Merseyrail EMUs if the usual platform is blocked. This facility is used rarely, as any terminating train in this platform will block the through line towards Manchester, with potential delays to other services.

==Layout==
The station is in a cutting and is reached by stepped ramps from the ticket office. A building on the Southport/Manchester-bound (island) platform (platforms 2&3) contains a disabled toilet, a snack shop and waiting room. The former main station building has been converted into a bar/restaurant and has been replaced by a modern ticket office. A small car park is available, and bus stops are nearby.
