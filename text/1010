In 1900 two redesigned Class 6 [[4-6-0]] [[steam locomotive]]s were placed in service by the [[Cape Government Railways]]. In 1912, when they were assimilated into the South African Railways, later renamed Spoornet and then [[Transnet Freight Rail]], they were renumbered and reclassified to '''Class 6F'''.<ref name="Holland 1"/><ref name="Paxton-Bourne"/>

==Manufacturers==
The Class 6 was designed at the Salt River works of the Cape Government Railways (CGR) at the same time as the [[South African Class 7 4-8-0|Class 7]], both according to the specifications of Michael Stephens, then Chief Locomotive Superintendent of the CGR<U+2019>s Western System, and under the supervision of CGR Locomotive Superintendent H.M. Beatty. While the Class 7 was conceived primarily as a goods locomotive, the Class 6 was intended to be its fast passenger service counterpart.<ref name="Holland 1"/>

The two Class 6 locomotives that were placed in service by the CGR in 1900 were built by [[Sharp, Stewart and Company]], numbered 260 and 261 and allocated to the Western System. They reflected the decision of H.M. Beatty, who succeeded Michael Stephens as Chief Locomotive Superintendent in 1895, to adopt bar frames for future CGR locomotives.<ref name="Holland 1"/>

They were also equipped with the large commodious cabs which were to become standard in all subsequent designs. They had larger heating surfaces and grate areas than any of the previous Class 6 engines, with the boiler pressure increased to {{convert|180|psi|kPa|abbr=off|sigfig=3}} and with larger tenders riding on bogies. In visual appearance they differed from all previous Class 6 locomotives by having higher mounted running boards without driving wheel fairings.<ref name="Holland 1"/>

==Class 6 sub-classes==
When these two locomotives were assimilated into the newly established South African Railways (SAR) in 1912, they were renumbered 604 and 605 and reclassified to '''Class 6F'''. The rest of the CGR<U+2019>s Class 6 locomotives, together with Class 6 locomotives that were inherited from the ''Oranje-Vrijstaat Gouwermentspoorwegen'' (OVGS) via the Imperial Military Railways (IMR) and the Central South African Railways (CSAR), as well as the CSAR<U+2019>s own Classes 6-L1 to 6-L3, were grouped into thirteen more sub-classes by the SAR, the 4-6-0 locomotives becoming SAR Classes 6, 6A to 6E, 6G, 6H and 6J to 6L, the 2-6-2 locomotives becoming Class 6Y and the 2-6-4 locomotives becoming Class 6Z.<ref name="diagram-book">South African Railways and Harbours Locomotive Diagram Book, 2<U+2019>0<U+201D> & 3<U+2019>6<U+201D> Gauge Steam Locomotives, 15 August 1941, as amended</ref><ref name="Holland 2"/>

==Service==
The Class 6 series of locomotives were introduced primarily as passenger engines, but when the class became displaced by larger and more powerful locomotive classes, it literally became a <U+201C>Jack-of-all-trades<U+201D> that proved itself as one of the most useful and successful locomotive classes ever to be designed at the Salt River shops. It went on to see service in all parts of the country except Natal and was used on all types of traffic.<ref name="Holland 1"/>

These two locomotives were placed in service on the Cape main line. Compared to most of the rest of the Class 6 family, they had a relatively short life span of less than thirty years, having been withdrawn from service by 1929.<ref name="Paxton-Bourne"/>
