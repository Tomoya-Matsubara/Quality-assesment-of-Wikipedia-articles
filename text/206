The '''Daimler D.I''' (also known by the company designation '''L6''') was a German fighter aircraft of World War I. It was a conventional biplane design with a very small interplane gap - the top wing nearly touched the top of the fuselage. Power was provided by a [[Daimler D.III]] engine. The L6 prototype won an [[Idflieg]] competition for a new fighter design in 1918, but only six examples were built before the end of the war.
