Oxford's coaches were G. C. Bourne who had rowed for university in the [[The Boat Race 1882|1882]] and [[The Boat Race 1883|1883 races]], [[William Fletcher (rower)|William Fletcher]], who rowed for them in the [[The Boat Race 1890|1890]], [[The Boat Race 1891|1891]], [[The Boat Race 1892|1892]] and [[The Boat Race 1893|1893 races]] and C. K. Philips who had represented the Dark Blues four times between 1895 and 1898.  Cambridge were coached by Francis Escombe and  and Claude Waterhouse Hearn Taylor (who rowed for Cambridge three times between 1901 and 1903).<ref>Burnell, pp. 110&ndash;111</ref>  The umpire for the second year was old [[Eton College|Etonian]] and former Cambridge rower [[Frederick I. Pitman]] who rowed in the [[The Boat Race 1884|1884]], [[The Boat Race 1885|1885]] and [[The Boat Race 1886|1886 races]].<ref>Burnell, pp. 49, 108</ref>

Both boat club presidents, Monier-Williams and Edwards-Moss, were unable to row through injury.<ref>Drinkwater, p. 113</ref>  According to George Drinkwater, contemporary Oxford rower and subsequent author, the Dark Blues "never got together ... and invariably lost form over a long course".<ref name=drink114>Drinkwater, p. 114</ref>  He also noted that "Cambridge were not up to the standard of their last two crews."<ref name= drink114/>

==Race==
[[File:University Boat Race Thames map.svg|right|thumb|[[The Championship Course]] along which the Boat Race is contested]]
Cambridge won the [[coin flipping|toss]] and elected to start from the Surrey station, handing the Middlesex side of the river to Oxford.<ref name=burn68>Burnell, p. 68</ref>  Pitman started the race at 7:45&nbsp;a.m. in cold and foggy conditions, and on a weak tide.<ref name=drink114/>  Oxford took an early lead, [[stroke rate|outrating]] Cambridge from the start, and getting clear of them by the Mile Post.  The Light Blues steadied their rhythm and started to catch Oxford, and errant steering from the the Dark Blue cox E. C. T. Warner at [[Harrods Furniture Depository]] allowed Cambridge to reduce the deficit.<ref name=drink114/>

By [[Hammersmith Bridge]], Oxford's lead was down to two-thirds of a length and by The Doves pub, the crews were level.  The Light Blues pushed ahead and were clear by Chiswick Ferry as Oxford struggled to maintain their technique.<ref name=drink114/>  Cambridge passed the finishing post with a lead of four-and-a-half lengths, in a winning time of 21 minutes 37 seconds,<ref name=burn68/> the slowest winning time since the [[The Boat Race 1898|1898 race]].<ref name=results/>   It was Cambridge's third consecutive victory and their fifth in six years.   Drinkwater remarked that the "race was a good one, for the crews were more evenly matched".<ref name=drink114/>
