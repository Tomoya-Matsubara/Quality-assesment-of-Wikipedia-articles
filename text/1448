'''SummerSlam (2013)''' was a professional wrestling [[pay-per-view]] event produced by [[WWE]] that took place on August 18, 2013 at the [[Staples Center]] in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/events/all/summerslam/all/all/all/3000/mi |title=WWE.com: WWE Tickets and Live Events Information from |publisher=WWE |date=2013-08-19 |accessdate=2013-08-25}}</ref> It was the twenty-sixth annual SummerSlam, and the fifth consecutive one held at the Staples Center.

==Background==

SummerSlam featured professional wrestling matches that involved different wrestlers from pre-existing feuds, plots, and storylines that played out on WWE's primary television programs. Wrestlers portrayed villains or heroes as they followed a series of events that buildt tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.

On the July 15 episode of ''[[WWE Raw|Raw]]'', new [[Professional wrestling authority figures|Raw General Manager]] [[Brad Maddox]] announced that [[WWE Championship|WWE Champion]] [[John Cena]] could choose his own opponent for SummerSlam. Later in the night, after taking an informal poll of the live audience, he chose [[Daniel Bryan]].  On the August 12 ''Raw'', Maddox served as special guest referee in a match with Bryan facing [[Wade Barrett]]. After making a quick count to allow Barrett to win the match, Maddox offered his services as the guest referee for the Cena-Bryan match at the PPV when [[Triple H]] interceded, and announced he would serve as referee instead (punctuated by a Pedigree to Maddox).

Also on the same episode, [[Brock Lesnar]] made his return when he attacked [[CM Punk]]. The following week on ''Raw'', [[Paul Heyman]] accepted Punk's challenge for a match at SummerSlam on behalf of Lesnar.<ref>{{cite web|last=Benigno |first=Anthony |url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/2013-07-22/wwe-raw-results-26133895/page-8 |title=Raw results: Daniel Bryan runs the gauntlet and "The Best" baits "The Beast" |publisher=WWE.com |date=2013-07-22 |accessdate=2013-08-25}}</ref>

On the July 19 episode of ''[[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown]]'', [[Randy Orton]] defeated [[World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)|World Heavyweight Champion]] [[Alberto Del Rio]] in a non-title match. However, on the July 29 ''Raw'', [[Christian (wrestler)|Christian]] also defeated Del Rio in a non-title match. To determine the next challenger for Del Rio's championship, new [[Professional wrestling authority figures|SmackDown General Manager]] [[Vickie Guerrero]] decided to make a [[triple threat match]] between Christian, Orton, and the returning [[Rob Van Dam]]. The match ended with Christian reversing Orton's attempt of an RKO into a backslide pin, winning the match and becoming the new #1 contender for the title before being attacked by Del Rio.  On the August 9th edition of ''SmackDown'', Christian defeated Del Rio in another non-title match.

At the [[Money in the Bank (2013)|Money in the Bank]] pay-per-view on July 14, [[Damien Sandow]] won the [[Money in the Bank ladder match|Money in the Bank briefcase]] for a future World Heavyweight Championship shot, betraying his former tag team partner [[Cody Rhodes]] in the process. Rhodes attacked Sandow after the latter's loss to Christian the following night on ''Raw''.  On the July 26 ''SmackDown'', while Sandow was facing Randy Orton in a singles match, Rhodes took his briefcase, causing Sandow to lose the match and search for it. Rhodes threw it into the [[Gulf of Mexico]], and Sandow was unable to retrieve it because he couldn't swim.  It was announced on the August 5 ''Raw'' that Rhodes would face Sandow at SummerSlam.  Four days later on ''SmackDown'', Sandow debuted his new, brown Money in the Bank briefcase with a new World Heavyweight Championship contract.  Later on, after Christian defeated Del Rio in a non-title match, Sandow attempted to cash in his contract, but his effort was thwarted by Rhodes.

On the July 8 ''Raw'', after [[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]] defeated Christian in a singles match, [[The Wyatt Family (professional wrestling)|The Wyatt Family]] attacked Kane, removing him from competing at the Money in the Bank match for the WWE Championship contract. The Wyatt Family attacked Kane again three weeks later on ''Raw'', after Daniel Bryan defeated him in a singles match.  A week later on ''Raw'', after [[Erick Rowan]] and [[Brodie Lee|Luke Harper]] defeated Tons of Funk ([[Brodus Clay]] and [[Matt Bloom|Tensai]]) in a tag team match, Kane announced that he would face Bray Wyatt in a "Ring of Fire" match at SummerSlam.

After AJ Lee retained her Divas Championship against Kaitlyn at Money in the Bank and later on cost Dolph Ziggler at winning the World Heavyweight Championship, Ziggler broke up with Lee the next night on ''Raw'', causing her to distract Ziggler in his non-title rematch against Del Rio and leaving [[Big E Langston]] to attack him. On the July 29 ''Raw'', Kaitlyn defeated Lee in a non-title match to stay in contention for the Divas Championship, but four days later on ''SmackDown'', Lee defeated Kaitlyn to retain the championship due to Layla interfering and protecting Lee. A week later on ''Smackdown'', [[The Miz]] - the host of SummerSlam - announced that Kaitlyn and Ziggler would face Lee and Langston in a mix tag team match at the PPV.

On the August 12 ''Raw'' - as a result of their feud stemming from starring on ''[[Total Divas]]'' - [[Natalya Neidhart|Natalya]] challenged [[Brie Bella]] to a match at the PPV, which she accepted by slapping Natalya's face. Natalya also announced that [[The Funkadactyls]] ([[Cameron Lynn|Cameron]] and [[Naomi Knight|Naomi]]) will be in her corner due the fact that [[Eva Marie]] has aligned herself with [[The Bella Twins]]. Later, on the same episode, [[Rob Van Dam]] won a 20 man [[battle royal]] (lastly eliminating [[Mark Henry]]) to win the right to challenge [[WWE United States Championship|United States Champion]] [[Dean Ambrose]] for the title at the SummerSlam Kickoff Show, one hour prior to the PPV broadcast.
