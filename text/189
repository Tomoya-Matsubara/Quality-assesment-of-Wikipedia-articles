'''''Goin' Home''''' is a [[studio album]] by American saxophonist [[Archie Shepp]] and pianist [[Horace Parlan]]. After their respective work in the [[avant-garde jazz]] movement of the 1960s, Shepp and Parlan both faced career challenges as the [[jazz]] scene diverged stylistically. They left the United States for Europe during the 1970s and met each other in Denmark before recording the album on April 25, 1977, at Sweet Silence Studio in [[Copenhagen]]. 

A [[jazz]] and [[gospel music|gospel]] album, ''Goin' Home'' features Shepp and Parlan's interpretations of African-American folk melodies and [[Spiritual (music)|spirituals]]. Its title is an allusion to Shepp's return to his African cultural roots. Shepp had never recorded spirituals before and was overcome with emotion during the album's recording because of the historical and cultural context of the songs.

Although it surprised jazz listeners upon its release in 1977, ''Goin' Home'' was praised by [[music journalism|music critics]] for its reverent tone and stylistic deviation from Shepp's previous [[free jazz]] works. Shepp and Parlan were artistically satisfied with the album and subsequently recorded another album together, ''Trouble in Mind'', in 1980. ''Goin' Home'' was [[reissue]]d on [[Compact Disc|CD]] by [[SteepleChase Records]] on May 3, 1994.

[[File:Archie Shepp (cropped).jpg|left|thumb|230px|[[Archie Shepp]] playing [[soprano saxophone]]]]

After surging to the forefront of the [[avant-garde jazz]] movement during the 1960s, both [[Archie Shepp]] and [[Horace Parlan]] faced career challenges during the 1970s after their style lost popularity in the jazz scene, which had split between artists who played either a tamer or a more experimental sound.{{sfn|Moon|2008|p=694}} Like Parlan, Shepp became a more mainstream performer, mostly playing [[hard bop]], although he occasionally return to his [[free jazz]] sound. To support himself financially, he spent most of his time playing in [[European free jazz|Europe]].{{sfn|Nisenson|2009|p=227}} In 1972, Parlan also left the United States and eventually made his residence in [[Denmark]].<ref name="Fraser">{{cite news|last=Fraser|first=C.

== Concept ==
''Goin' Home'' is a reverent jazz and gospel album played with straightforward simplicity by Shepp and Parlan.{{sfn|Moon|2008|p=694}} They interpret nine traditional [[Negro spiritual]]s,{{sfn|Hoffmann|Jost|2002|p=134}} featuring African-American folk melodies that originated from the 1920s and before.<ref name="Yanow"/> Along with ''Trouble in Mind'' and ''[[Looking at Bird]]'' in 1980, ''Goin' Home'' is part of a series of albums delineated in Shepp's discography as "modular explorations of traditional musical styles", which is itself in Shepp's broader series of musical "portraits of [[African diaspora|the Diaspora]]".{{sfn|Weinstein|1992|p=139}} The album's title alludes to a return to African cultural roots.{{sfn|Okpewho|Davies|Mazrui|2001|p=xxiii}} 

Shepp viewed ''Goin' Home'' as his attempt to cross the span of time and history between modern African Americans and the [[black slave]]s symbolized by the spirituals.{{sfn|Hoffmann|Jost|2002|p=133}} In an interview for ''[[Down Beat]]'', Shepp said that it was the first time he had recorded spirituals or made "any kind of serious statement about them", and said that he started to cry when he started playing on the album due to "the strain, the spiritual weight of the moment".<ref name="DB"/> He recalled being momentarily afraid that he would not be able to go through with the album's recording because of his emotional state, which he explained: 

{{quote|I felt I represented everybody who'd ever sang those songs, and to make the meaning of those songs clear was up to me at that point. They should be truthful, they should have the same authenticity as when they were sung, because that's the nature of this type of folk song. They were created by people who were in deep sorrow; they're slave songs. And so it challenged my own ability as modern Negro black man to traverse that historical plain. Could I do that? And I felt I could, and the tears were proof of it - that perhaps my condition hadn't changed so completely that I can't still feel what they felt.<ref name="DB"/>}}

The album has a melodic [[musical form|form]],<ref name="Yanow"/> and employs [[pentatonic scale]]s for melodic [[Musical development|development]], a practice common in [[African music|African]] and [[African-American music|African-American folk music]].{{sfn|Floyd|1995|p=189}} ''Goin' Home'' is mostly [[tempo]]less,{{sfn|Moon|2008|p=694}} as most of the pieces are performed in a [[Tempo rubato|rubato]]-like [[Meter (music)#Metric structure|free rhythm]].{{sfn|Hoffmann|Jost|2002|p=134}} Shepp and Parlan perform sudden accelerations and intended delays and halts, particularly at the end of [[bar (music)|bars]], [[phrase (music)|phrases]], and [[section (music)|sections]] in a piece.{{sfn|Hoffmann|Jost|2002|p=135}} Most of the spirituals have a [[thirty-two-bar form]], with the [[thirty-two-bar form#Middle eight|eight-bar section]] comprising four two-bar phrases wherein two choruses of the spiritual are played. Shepp and Parlan's interpretations include few choruses from the original spirituals.{{sfn|Hoffmann|Jost|2002|p=134}}

Eschewing common jazz practice, Shepp does not [[musical improvisation|improvise]] new melodic lines within the spirituals' [[harmony|harmonic]] framework, but plays short, impromptu [[passage (music)|passages]] around a [[motif (music)|melodic idea]]. Parlan plays piano solos on only two of the album's pieces.{{sfn|Hoffmann|Jost|2002|p=134}} Shepp contributes a [[musical tone|tonal]] [[Roughness (psychophysics)|roughness]] to the songs with [[growling (wind instruments)|growled]] sounds, which he plays by singing or humming into his saxophone.{{sfn|Hoffmann|Jost|p=144}} He also uses harmonic [[overtone]]s, breathy tonal weight, and expressive [[Chromatic scale|chromatic]] development of melody to add [[texture (music)|textural]] and [[timbre|timbral]] variety to the songs.<ref name="Lange">{{cite journal|last=Lange|first=Art|year=1980|issue=177|page=25|title=Review: Goin' Home|journal=[[CODA (magazine)|CODA]]|location=Toronto}}</ref> Shepp and Parlan's reverent takes on "Amazing Grace" and Go Down Moses" exhibit [[split tone]]s and [[forte (music)|fortes]].{{sfn|Litweiler|1984|p=135}}

== Critical reception ==
Jazz listeners were divided in their reaction to ''Goin' Home'' upon its release.<ref name="Ramsey"/> According to Doug Ramsey of ''[[Texas Monthly]]'', some listeners were surprised by Shepp's stylistic change, while others viewed it as a "fulfillment of promise." Ramsey felt that it revealed a "tenderness and humor" from Shepp that his 1960s work only hinted at, writing that it "disclosed an Archie Shepp that many had never known, warm rather than blistering hot, witty rather than contemptuously sardonic."<ref name="Ramsey">{{cite journal|last=Ramsey|first=Doug|month=July|year=1984|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=nisEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA144#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Getting Mellow|journal=[[Texas Monthly]]|accessdate=February 17, 2013}}</ref> John Swenson, writing in ''[[The Rolling Stone Album Guide|The Rolling Stone Jazz Record Guide]]'' (1985), praised Shepp's work with Parlan and gave ''Goin' Home'' a five-star rating, finding it "particularly heartfelt."{{sfn|Swenson|1985|p=1979}} Fernando Gonzalez of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' called it "exquisite",<ref>{{cite news|last=Gonzalez|first=Fernando|date=July 8, 1988|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/boston/access/59642943.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Jul+08%2C+1988&author=Fernando+Gonzalez%2C+Globe+Staff&pub=Boston+Globe+(pre-1997+Fulltext)&desc=A+SURPRISINGLY+JAZZY+WEEKEND&pqatl=google|title=A Surprisingly Jazzy Weekend|newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]]|at=Arts and Film section, p. 48|accessdate=February 17, 2013}} {{subscription required}}</ref> and C. Gerald Fraser of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote in 1987 that "this marriage of avant-garde and [[soul music|soul]]" is "regarded as a classic."<ref name="Fraser"/> Art Lange of ''[[CODA (magazine)|CODA]]'' magazine praised Shepp's "exquisite control" of his instrument, which he "quite literally" makes "able [to] talk", and found the spirituals to have been "sung" rather than just performed.<ref name="Lange"/> Lange added that the emotional aspect is more impressive than the technical skill and stated:

{{quote|[T]he result is a truly spiritual music <U+2014> one which is tender, passionate, muscular, uplifting, sensual, fiery, heartfelt, and heaven-storming all at once ... you can hear the same cry heard in [[Mahalia Jackson]], in [[Billie Holiday]], in [[Lester Young]], in [[Ornette Coleman|Ornette]]'s piercing wail, in [[Albert Ayler|Ayler]]'s wide-eyed scream, in [[Charles Mingus|Mingus]], in [[John Coltrane|Coltrane]]. It is not a cry of lament or a cry of weakness <U+2014> it is a cry of strength, of affirmation, of soul.<ref name="Lange"/>}}

In a retrospective review, [[Allmusic]] editor Scott Yanow gave the album four-and-a-half out of five stars and found the performances "compelling". He commented that listeners who are "only familiar with Shepp's earlier ''[[Fire Music]]''" will see the album as a "revelation."<ref name="Yanow">{{cite web|last=Yanow|first=Scott|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/goin-home-mw0000192507|title=Goin' Home - Archie Shepp|publisher=[[Allmusic]]|accessdate=February 17, 2013|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6EYLchi36|archivedate=February 19, 2013|deadurl=no}}</ref> Music author Tom Moon felt that its tempoless mood "gives the themes an extra shot of majesty" and found it "supremely melodic", writing that both Shepp and Parlan "do whatever is necessary to bring the spirit to the forefront."{{sfn|Moon|2008|p=694}} [[Richard Cook (journalist)|Richard Cook]] gave it four out of four stars in ''[[The Penguin Guide to Jazz]]'' (2002).{{sfn|Cook|Morton|2002|p=1335}} ''[[JazzTimes]]'' cited ''Goin' Home'' as one of "the finest [albums] of his career",<ref>{{cite journal|journal=[[JazzTimes]]|year=2001|page=304|volume=31|issue=1<U+2013>5}}</ref> and Tom Hull of ''[[The Village Voice]]'' cited it as SteepleChase's best release.<ref>{{cite news|last=Hull|first=Tom|date=May 24, 2005|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/2005-05-24/music/covering-expenses/full/|title=Covering Expenses|newspaper=[[The Village Voice]]|location=New York|accessdate=February 17, 2013|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6EYLf1ROx|archivedate=February 19, 2013|deadurl=no}}</ref> Phil Johnson of ''[[The Independent]]'' wrote that the album "can be listened to almost without cease."<ref>{{cite news|last=Johnson|first=Phil|date=August 4, 2000|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/reviews/familiar-standards-that-still-sound-fresh-out-the-box-697532.html|title=Familiar standards that still sound fresh out the box|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|location=London|accessdate=February 17, 2013}}</ref> Jazz historian [[Eric Nisenson]] called it "one of the most moving albums of the Seventies", but qualified his praise by critiquing that Shepp, an iconic figure in free jazz, "was no longer the firebrand who had so frightened and unsettled some white critics and jazz fans." Nisenson felt that, like [[Pharoah Sanders]], Shepp's "trial by fire at the heart of the Sixties avant-garde had made him an unusually expressive musician," and ''Goin' Home'' showed that he was "finding inspiration in the entire black musical tradition."{{sfn|Nisenson|2009|p=227}}
