'''Maria Magdalena Laubser''', known as '''Maggie Laubser''' (14 April 1886 <U+2013> 17 May 1973)<ref name="VanRooyen">{{cite book|last=Van Rooyen|first=Johann|title=Maggie Laubser|year=1974|publisher=Struik|location=Cape Town|url=http://openlibrary.org/works/OL16359665W/Maggie_Laubser}}</ref>  was a South African [[Painting|painter]] and [[printmaker]]. She is generally considered, along with [[Irma Stern]], to be responsible for the introduction of [[Expressionism]] to South Africa.<ref name=Donker>{{cite book|last=Fransen|first=Hans|title=Three Centuries of South African Art|year=1982|publisher=Ad. Donker (Pty) Ltd|location=Johannesburg|isbn=0868520128|pages=286<U+2013>292}}</ref> Her work was initially met with derision by critics but has gained wide acceptance, and now she is regarded as an exemplary and quintessentially South African artist.<ref name=Meintjes/>

== Early life and education==
Maria Magdalena Laubser was born on the wheat farm ''Bloublommetjieskloof'' near [[Malmesbury, Western Cape|Malmesbury]] in the [[Swartland]], a productive agricultural area in South Africa.<ref name=Berman/><ref name=VanRooyen/> She was the eldest of six children of Gerhardus Petrus Christiaan Laubser and Johanna Catharina Laubser (n<U+00E9>e Holm).<ref name=SANG>{{cite book|last=Bokhorst|first=M.|title=Maggie Laubser - Retrospective Exhibition, 3rd July - 2nd Sept., 1969|year=1969|publisher=South African National Gallery|location=Cape Town|url=http://www.art-archives-southafrica.ch/PDFs/Laubser_SANG_1969_part-cat.pdf}}</ref> Laubser's youth was dominated by the rural and pastoral and she delighted in this carefree existence.<ref name=Schutte>Schutte, Jan.

After attending the farm school Rocklands,<ref name=SANG/> she left for boarding school at Bloemhof Seminary, [[Stellenbosch]], where she was introduced to the art of drawing.<ref name=Marais/> She returned to the farm in 1901, and during a visit to [[Cape Town]] she met [[Beatrice Hazel]], a realistic [[Romanticism|romantic]] style painter, who introduced her to [[Edward Roworth]],<ref name=SANG/> giving impetus to her desire to study painting.<ref name=Berman/>

In 1903 she convinced her parents to let her go to Cape Town once a week for singing lessons. The difficulty of travel and the low opinion her mother had of her mezzo-soprano voice discouraged her, but it was at this stage that she started painting on her own.<ref name=Marais/>

She studied painting under Roworth in Cape Town for two months of 1903, during which time she received a silver medal for her work.<ref name=Marais/><ref name=Meintjes>{{cite book|last=Meintjes|first=Johannes|title=Maggie Laubser|year=1944|publisher=HAUM|location=Cape Town|url=http://openlibrary.org/works/OL6309691W/Maggie_Laubser}}</ref><ref name=Donker/> By 1907 she had become proficient enough to be elected to the [[South African Society of Artists]] (SASA)<ref name=VanRooyen/> and, in 1909, she was represented at the annual exhibition of the SASA and the [[Fine Arts Association of Cape Town]]. By 1910, she had her own studio in [[Strand Street (Cape Town)|Strand Street]], Cape Town.<ref name=Marais/>

During a 1912 visit to her nephew, Gert Coetzee, in [[Pretoria]], she took up employment as a governess on a farm owned by the Wolmarans family in [[Ermelo]] district, [[Transvaal]], where she also taught art and needlework. While on vacation in [[Durban]] with a friend, Sophie Fisher, she befriended [[Jan Hendrik Arnold Balw<U+00E9>]] (Consul for the Netherlands in Durban 1903-1913), a shipping-line owner who offered to finance her and her sister Hannah's studies abroad.<ref name=Meintjes/><ref name=SANG/>

===Holland and England===
Laubser and her sister left for Europe on 4 October 1913, initially living in an artists' colony at [[Laren|Laren, Noord-Holland]] in an area called [[het Gooi]]. She met [[Ita Mees]], a concert pianist and [[Frederik van Eeden]], author and poet. She also befriended [[Laura Knight]] and [[Frans Langeveld]], both painters.<ref name=Marais/> In the last years of his life, [[Anton Mauve]] (1838&nbsp;<U+2013>&nbsp;1888), who was an important influence on [[Vincent van Gogh]], lived in Laren. Maggie worked in the studio he established there.<ref name=Marais/>

At the outbreak of [[World War I]] she went to London. She initially stayed in [[Huntingdonshire]] and then, in October 1914, moved to a London hotel and registered at the [[Slade School of Art]] for the period October 1914 to March 1919.<ref name=Marais/>  [[Henry Tonks]], [[Walter Russel]] and [[Ambrose McEvoy]] taught her drawing, while [[Philip Wilson Steer]] lectured her in painting.<ref name=Marais/><ref name=Berman/><ref name=Donker/> It seems that she never painted during her time at the Slade, instead concentrating her efforts on drawing of portraiture and [[figure study|figure studies]].<ref name=Meintjes/> Maggie returned to South Africa briefly in 1915 to visit the new family farm at ''Oortmanspost'', near Klipheuwel in the [[Cape Province]] and again in March 1919, after her studies were concluded.<ref name=Berman/>

==Early career and travels==
===Belgium, June 1919 to September 1920===
She left London on 6 June 1919 for Belgium, staying at [[Antwerp]] and the Villa Chenes in the Nachtigalen Lei in [[Schoten]].<ref name=Marais/> She befriended [[Arnold Balw<U+00E9>]], son of her patron, who studied at the [[Royal Academy of Fine Arts (Antwerp)|Academy]].<ref name=SANG/> She might have accompanied Balw<U+00E9> as an ''occasional'' student, as is evidenced by a number of nude studies sketched during this period.<ref name=Marais/> There is also some evidence that she came into contact with the art of [[Die Br<U+00FC>cke]] and [[Der Blaue Reiter]] during a stay in [[Munich]] in 1919.<ref name=Harmsen>{{cite book|last=Harmsen|first=Frieda|title=Looking at South African Art|year=1985|publisher=J.L. van Schaik|location=Pretoria|isbn=0627014119}}</ref>

===Italy, October 1920 to August 1921===
[[File:Maggie Laubser, Pink Blossoming Tree, undated (1920<U+2013>1921), oil on cardboard, 340 x 400 mm.jpg|thumb|Pink Blossoming Tree, (1920<U+2013>1921), oil on cardboard, 340 x 400 mm, Sanlam Art Collection]]
She travelled with Balw<U+00E9> to Italy in August/September 1920<ref name=Marais/> and lived and worked at [[Torri del Benaco]] and San Vigilio on the [[Garda Lake]].<ref name=Berman/> During this time the couple was supported financially by Balw<U+00E9>'s father and this gave them freedom to work on paintings for possible exhibitions in stead of sale. A large number of signed and dated works from this period give some support to this.<ref name=Marais/>

J. H. A. Balw<U+00E9> had been ill towards the end of 1920, and Arnold Balw<U+00E9> and Maggie accompanied him to [[Bad Kissingen]] in mid-April 1921, where he died in April or May of that year. After Balw<U+00E9>'s death Laubser's meanders took her to Venice, where she visited the [[Doge's Palace]] (June/July 1921), then to [[Milan]] and, on 18 August 1921, back to Germany. On 19 September 1921 she arrived in Cape Town on the [[Union-Castle Line]].<ref name=Marais/>

===Germany, November 1922 to November 1924===
[[File:Maggie Laubser, Portrait of a Man Berlin, undated (circa 1923), oil on board, 595 x 475 mm.jpg|thumb|left|Portrait of a Man, Berlin, (circa 1923), oil on board, 595 x 475 mm]]
Laubser was issued with a visa by the German Consulate in Cape Town on 16 November 1922 and was installed at [[Kurf<U+00FC>rstendamm]] 40, Berlin by 1 January 1923. Her address had apparently changed to Kurf<U+00FC>rstendamm 43, Berlin by 23 January 1923.<ref name=Marais/> She looked up [[Irma Stern]] and they undertook a trip to the Baltic Sea at [[Ahrenshoop]] for three weeks in July 1923.<ref name=Berman/><ref name=Marais/><ref name=VanRooyen/> After trips to [[Weimar]] and [[Bavaria]] and another change of address from Kalckreuthstrasse 5 to lodgings with a Fr<U+00E4>ulein Finck at Von der Heydt Strasse 1, south of the [[Tiergarten]], which she obtained with the help of her friend Kate M<U+00E4>dler, she settled down to the cultural life of Berlin. She met members of the diplomatic corps, painted portraits and attended music concerts. She befriended pianists [[Wilhelm Busch]] and [[Otto Glore]].<ref name=SANG/>

It was in [[Berlin]], from 1922 to 1924, that she came into contact with [[German Expressionism]] and was encouraged by [[Karl Schmidt-Rottluff]].<ref name=Berman/><ref name=Harmsen/> The works of [[Emil Nolde]], [[Max Pechstein]], [[Franz Marc]] and [[Erich Waske]] were available to her and clarified her ambitions. She singled out Franz Marc of Der Blaue Reiter and Nolde, Schmidt-Rottluff and Pechstein of Die Br<U+00FC>cke as significant to her personality, although she would claim not to have been ''influenced'' by them.<ref name=VanRooyen/> The extent of their influence is evident in that she came closest to the German Expressionist style during these years, in which she produced a series of ten lithographs called ''Visionen''.<ref name=Donker/>

On August 14, 1924 she made arrangements with Allison Bros., London to ship her paintings to South Africa.<ref name=Marais/>

==South African debut and critical reception==
[[File:Maggie Laubser Bloublommetjieskloof.jpg|thumb|left|Bloublommetjieskloof, oil on canvas laid-down on board, 270 x 365 mm]]
In November 1924, Laubser returned to South Africa and settled at ''Oortmanspost'', the family farm.<ref name=VanRooyen/> She met sculptor [[Moses Kottler]] and the cartoonist [[D. C. Boonzaier]], who introduced her to his son [[Gregoire Boonzaier|Gregoire]], founding member of the [[New Group]], and renewed her friendship with painters [[Ruth Prowse]] and [[Nita Spilhaus]].<ref name=VanRooyen/> She was asked to exhibit in Cape Town, and was cruelly disillusioned.<ref name=Meintjes/> Her work, like that of Irma Stern, met with fierce criticism, most notably from [[Bernard Lewis (critic)|Bernard Lewis]] of ''[[Die Burger]]'' and ''[[The Cape Times]]'',<ref name=VanRooyen/><ref name=Donker/> who as late as 1931 was able to write of her work in a group show:

{{quote|"Is there any normal, sane human being in all South Africa who is able to appreciate as a work of art, to enjoy as a picture...the one sent by Maggie Laubser?"&nbsp;&mdash;Bernard Lewis<ref name=VanRooyen/>}}

In April 1929 she met  P. Serton and his wife, as well as  A. C. Celliers and  Koos Botha, all of whom encouraged her to have a one man exhibition.<ref name=Marais/> Her first solo exhibition was held in Stellenbosch, with support from  [[A. C. Bouman]] and  [[Con de Villiers]]. During this time she also met [[Martin du Toit]], who would become a fervent supporter, organising her first exhibition in the Transvaal in 1931.<ref name=Meintjes/>

==Empire Exhibition, Johannesburg, 1936==
On May 3, 1936, Laubser's father died, leaving the farm to her brother, and establishing a trust fund for her mother. Laubser would inherit the balance of the trust fund when her mother died on November 20, 1936.<ref name=Marais/> Although she was treated harshly by the press,  Laubser was elected to the selection panel of the prestigious [[British Empire Exhibition]], the convener of which was  M. L. du Toit, without her parents living to see this acquiescence to her talents.

The Empire Exhibition was a quadrennial exposition, which in 1936 was held in Milner Park, Johannesburg, and it was representative of the best South Africa had to offer.<ref name=Berman/> It was here that Laubser would become familiar with [[Alexis Preller]], who would attract the ire of the critics for his work at the first [[New Group]] exhibition on 4 May 1938. Maggie Laubser would also be a member of the New Group, and present at the exhibition of 1938.<ref name=Berman/>

==Later years and legacy==

Maggie Laubser was active from as early as 1900 and continued working uninterrupted until her death in 1973. The [[catalogue raisonn<U+00E9>]] compiled by Dalene Marais<ref name=Marais/> contains 1784 individual works. Her predominant style of work is generally accepted by many authors to be Expressionist,<ref name=Harmsen/><ref name=Meintjes/><ref name=VanRooyen/> but there are also identifiable elements of [[Fauvism]] at work, and a [[Pastoral#Pastoral_art|pastoralism]] that belie the German Expressionist prototypes to which Maggie was exposed.<ref name=Harmsen/> 

After the death of her parents she settled in Cape Town in 1937, taking a studio in [[Drie Ankerbaai]]. In 1942, she moved to the Strand. She built a cottage there, called ''Altyd Lig'' (Always Bright), in 1947.<ref name=Marais/> On 28 May 1946 Prof. P. J. Nienaber announced that Loubser would receive the honorary medal of the [[Academy of Arts and Science]].<ref name=Marais/><ref name=Berman/> In 1947 she received the ''Oscar award'' for painting from ''[[Die Vaderland]]'', a newspaper. In 1948, membership of the South African Academy for Arts and Science was awarded to her and the poet [[Elizabeth Eybers]].<ref>''Die Burger'', 2 September 1948, p. 12</ref> She continued painting and continued to evolve her style, and in 1959 she was presented with an honorary membership of the Academy of Art and Science. The South African Association of Arts honoured her with a medal in 1968, presented by Prof. A. L. Meiring.<ref name=Marais/><ref name=Berman/>

The [[South African National Gallery]] and the [[Pretoria Art Museum]] combined to host a major retrospective exhibition of Laubser's works in 1969.<ref name=Berman/><ref name=SANG/> This was followed in 1987 by a retrospective of early works, again at the South African National Gallery, which ran from 2 December 1987 to 31 January 1988.<ref name=Delmont>{{cite book|last=Delmont|first=Elizabeth|title=Maggie Laubser: Early Works from the Silberberg Collection|year=1987|publisher=South African National Gallery|location=Cape Town|url=http://openlibrary.org/works/OL4378586W/Maggie_Laubser}}</ref> 

Maggie Laubser died on 17 May 1973 at ''Altyd Lig''. There was an unfinished canvas on her easel.<ref name=Berman/>
