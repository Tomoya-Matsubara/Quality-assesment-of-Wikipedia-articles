The '''Klamath River''' ([[Karuk]]: '''''Ishk<U+00EA>esh''''', [[Klamath people|Klamath]]: '''''Koke'''''<ref>McArthur, p. 542</ref>) is an [[United States|American]] river that flows {{convert|263|mi|km}} southwest through [[Oregon]] and northern [[California]], cutting through the [[Cascade Range]] to empty into the [[Pacific Ocean]]. The river drains an extensive [[drainage basin|watershed]] of almost {{convert|16000|mi2|km2}} that stretches from the [[High Desert (Oregon)|high desert]] country of the [[Great Basin]] to the [[temperate rainforest]] of the [[West Coast of the United States|Pacific coast]]. It is known for its basin's peculiar geography<U+2014>most of its upper basin is developed, but the lower remains wild<U+2014>and has been called "a river upside down" by the [[National Geographic Society]].<ref name="natgeo">{{cite web

As one of the most important rivers for [[fish migration]] on the west coast of North America south of the [[Columbia River]], the Klamath River basin has been inhabited by humans for at least 7,000&nbsp;years. At one time, the river supported abundant wildlife. Vast freshwater [[marsh]]es in the upper basin provided habitat for thousands of migratory birds. The first [[Europe]]ans to visit the region were [[fur trapper]]s for the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] who came in the 1820s and established the [[Siskiyou Trail]] along the Klamath and [[Trinity River (California)|Trinity River]]s into the [[Sacramento Valley]]. The latter days of the [[California Gold Rush]] saw increasing numbers of miners working streams in the Klamath River region in search of gold. [[Steamboat]]s operated briefly on the large lakes in the upper watershed before the establishment of [[agriculture]] in the 19th and 20th centuries. The growing industry in the upper basin led to the construction of many [[dam]]s on the river, which have since caused water quality issues for the lower river. Environmentalists have raised petitions against the construction of more dams, and in support of removing the existing ones.

Because the Klamath includes many of the longest free-flowing stretches of river in California as well as some of its better [[whitewater]] runs, it has become a popular recreational river. Its watershed includes large swathes of the [[Klamath National Forest]] and [[Six Rivers National Forest]]. For now, the lower Klamath remains undeveloped, although massive diversions were once proposed to reroute the river into the [[Central Valley (California)|Central Valley]] in order to supplement the region's water supply.

[[Image:Klamath at Terwer.JPG|thumb|left|The Klamath approaching its mouth on the Pacific, near [[Klamath, California|the town Klamath]]]]
[[Upper Klamath Lake]], filling a broad valley at the foot of the eastern slope of the southern High Cascades, is the source of the Klamath River. Its headstreams, however, begin over {{convert|100|mi|km}} away<U+2014>as far as [[Crater Lake (Oregon)|Crater Lake]] and the Oregon<U+2013>[[Nevada]] border. The first {{convert|1|mi|km|adj=on}} stretch of the Klamath River is known as the [[Link River]]. Not long after, however, the river is impounded in an {{convert|18|mi|km|adj=on}} long [[reservoir]] near [[Klamath Falls, Oregon|Klamath Falls]], [[Lake Ewauna]], where it receives the [[Lost River (Oregon)|Lost River]] and passes the nearly dry bed of [[Lower Klamath Lake]].<ref name="gnis" /><ref name="dams">{{cite web|url=http://www.yuroktribe.org/departments/fisheries/documents/GECFinalReport.pdf|title=Klamath River Dam and Sediment Investigation|publisher=www.yuroktribe.org|work=Yurok Tribe of California|date=2006-11|accessdate=2009-08-21|format=PDF}}</ref><ref name="watershedmap, p. 27">''Hydrology, Ecology and Fishes of the Klamath River Basin'', p. 27</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = Ground-Water Hydrology of the Upper Klamath Basin, Oregon and California | work = Scientific Investigations Report 2007<U+2013>5050 | publisher = U.S. Geological Survey | url = http://pubs.usgs.gov/sir/2007/5050/section2.html | date = 2010-04-07 | accessdate = 2008-06-29}}</ref> Even after it flows out of this reservoir, it drops through a series of three more artificial lakes<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.americanrivers.org/our-work/restoring-rivers/dams/projects/restoring-klamath-river.html|title=Klamath River, Oregon and California|publisher=American Rivers|accessdate=2009-08-21}}</ref> before it crosses the Oregon<U+2013>California state border and turns south near the town of [[Hornbrook, California|Hornbrook]] towards [[Mount Shasta]]. However, the river soon swings west to receive the [[Shasta River]] and the [[Scott River (California)|Scott River]], cutting deep into the head of its canyon through the [[Klamath Mountains]].<ref name=overview>{{cite web | title = Klamath River Basin Issues and Activities:  An Overview | publisher = California Department of Energy | url = http://www.energy.ca.gov/klamath/documents/CRS_REPORT_RL33098.PDF | format = PDF | accessdate = 2008-06-29}}</ref>

The route through the High and Western Cascades and the Klamath Mountains constitutes the majority of the river's course and takes it from the arid [[High Desert (Oregon)|high desert]] climate of its upper watershed into a [[temperate rainforest]] nourished by Pacific rains. From the Scott River confluence, the river generally runs west along the south side of the [[Siskiyou Mountains]] until it takes a sharp southward turn near the town of [[Happy Camp, California|Happy Camp]]. From there, it flows southwest over whitewater rapids into the [[Klamath National Forest]], receiving the [[Salmon River (California)|Salmon River]], and passes the [[Unincorporated area|unincorporated community]] of [[Orleans, California|Orleans]]. At [[Weitchpec, California|Weitchpec]], the river reaches the southernmost point in its entire course and veers sharply northwards as it receives the [[Trinity River (California)|Trinity River]]. The Trinity River confluence also marks the point where the Klamath's current dramatically slows. For the remainder of its course, the Klamath flows generally northwest through the [[Hoopa Valley Indian Reservation|Hoopa Valley]] and [[Yurok Indian Reservation]]s, passing the town of [[Klamath, California|Klamath]] and flowing out to sea {{convert|16|mi|km}} south of [[Crescent City, California|Crescent City]].<ref name="dams"/><ref name="watershedmap, p. 37">''Hydrology, Ecology and Fishes of the Klamath River Basin'', p. 37</ref> <!-- Point St. George is at Crescent City. --> The mouth of the Klamath River is at [[Requa, California|Requa]],<ref name=CGN>{{California's Geographic Names|131}}</ref> in an area shared by the Yurok Reservation and [[Redwood National Park]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Yurok Tribe: tribal park concept plan|url=http://www.yuroktribe.org/government/selfgovern/YUROK%20TRIBAL%20PARK%20%20final%20lori%20edits%2013106.pdf|publisher=yuroktribe.org|accessdate=2011-07-16|format=PDF|date=2005-08}}</ref> The Klamath River estuary is recognized for protection by the [[California Bays and Estuaries Policy]].<ref name="swrcb">State Water Resources Control Board ''Water Quality Control Policy for the Enclosed Bays and Estuaries of California'' (1974), State of California</ref>

==Watershed==
[[Image:KlamathBasin-location.jpg|thumb|left|Klamath River watershed boundaries]]
{{Main|Klamath Basin}}
Extending from arid [[eastern Oregon]] to the cold and rainy [[Northern California]] coast, the [[Klamath Basin|Klamath River watershed]] drains parts of three Oregon counties and five counties in California and includes a diversity of landscapes. The northernmost part of the watershed is drained by the [[Williamson River (Oregon)|Williamson River]] and the [[Sprague River (Oregon)|Sprague River]], both which flow generally southwest into [[Upper Klamath Lake]]. The middle basin is characterized by extensive [[wetland]], [[grassland]], and [[agricultural]] areas, and is partially filled by two major bodies of water: Upper and [[Lower Klamath Lake]]. Finally, steep canyons and high ridges typify the extensive lower basin, which encompasses over one half of the {{convert|15751|mi2|km2|adj=on}} watershed.<ref name="watershedmap, p. 37"/><ref name="watershedsizes">''Hydrology, Ecology and Fishes of the Klamath River Basin'', p. 26</ref><ref name=USDA>{{cite web|url=ftp://ftp-fc.sc.egov.usda.gov/OR/Klamath/final%20summary%20introduction.pdf|title=Overview of the upper Klamath Basin|publisher=[[United States Department of Agriculture]] [[Natural Resources Conservation Service]]|format=PDF|accessdate=2009-08-21}}</ref>

Several other West Coast and [[Endorheic basin|interior drainage]] basins border on that of the Klamath River. On the northwest are the [[Rogue River (Oregon)|Rogue River]] and [[Umpqua River]] in Oregon and the [[Smith River (California)|Smith River]] in California. On the east there is the closed [[Harney Basin]] and a small portion of the [[Great Basin]]. The south side of the Klamath River watershed is bounded by the [[Sacramento River]] and its upper tributaries, including the [[Pit River]], and on the southwest side are the [[Mad River (California)|Mad River]] and [[Redwood Creek (Humboldt County, California)|Redwood Creek]].<ref name="NorthAmericaWatersheds">{{cite map

|url=http://atlas.nrcan.gc.ca/auth/english/maps/archives/various/north_america_cec_watersheds}}</ref> The western boundary of the upper Klamath Basin is formed by the High Cascades and the Klamath Mountains, one of the southernmost extents of the Cascade Range, and the [[California Coast Ranges]] cover the southwestern watershed. The Klamath is one of only three rivers that begins east of the Cascades and flows into the Pacific Ocean; the other two are the [[Columbia River|Columbia]] and the [[Fraser River|Fraser]].<ref>The Columbia River rises in the Rocky Mountain Trench of the Canadian Rockies several hundred&nbsp;miles east of the Cascades, while the Fraser begins in the Rocky Mountain Trench farther north. Both rivers cut through the Cascades to flow to the Pacific Ocean (in the case of the Fraser, the mountains there are called the Canadian Cascades, but geophysically they are part of the same range.) The Klamath<U+2019>s uppermost tributaries begin just to the northwest of the Great Basin, well to the east of the High Cascades. Rivers like the Rogue and Umpqua in Oregon that cut through the Coast Range and begin on the western slopes of the High Cascades should not be confused as cutting through the Cascades although they do flow through the parallel range.</ref>

Most human use of the watershed is limited to the upper basin. Despite the [[semiarid]] climate, dams have been built, [[irrigation]] water has been supplied from the Klamath and [[Lost River (Oregon)|Lost]] rivers, and plentiful [[groundwater]] has been drawn to transform most of the upper Klamath basin to farmland. At least 11,000&nbsp;years ago, Lower Klamath and [[Tule Lake]]s in the rainy season would combine into one giant freshwater marsh that was nearly {{convert|290|mi2|km2}} large. This, combined with the over {{convert|100|mi2|km2}} of Upper Klamath Lake, formed a temporary habitat for millions of migratory birds.<ref name="USFWS 2009">{{cite web|title=Klamath Basin National Wildlife Refuges|url=http://www.fws.gov/klamathbasinrefuges/history.html|publisher=U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service|accessdate=2011-07-28|date=2009-04-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Delong|first=Jay|url=http://www.nanfa.org/NANFAregions/or_wa/klamath/klamath.htm|title=Walking in 100-Year-Old Footsteps in Southern Oregon|publisher=www.nanfa.org|work=North American Native Fishes Association|date=|accessdate=2009-08-21}}</ref> These lakes are all remnants of a large [[Ice Age]] lake, Lake Modoc, that covered about {{convert|1100|mi2|km2}}.

Despite its plentiful flow in California, the Klamath does not supply significant amounts of water to irrigators and municipal users in central and southern portions of the state. The [[Klamath Reclamation Project]] in the [[Klamath Falls, Oregon|Klamath Falls]] area supplies water to area irrigators, and the [[Central Valley Project]] diverts water from the [[Trinity River (California)|Trinity River]] to supply irrigation water to the [[Sacramento Valley]].<ref name="shasta-trinity">{{cite web|url=http://www.usbr.gov/projects/Project.jsp?proj_Name=Shasta/Trinity%20River%20Division%20Project|title=Shasta/Trinity River Division Project|publisher=[[U.S. Bureau of Reclamation]]|date=2011-04-21|accessdate=2009-08-21}}</ref> Some of the rivers' tributaries, including the Lost and [[Shasta River]]s, are also diverted for irrigation. The status of the lower Klamath as one of the last relatively free-flowing rivers in the state of California and the use of its water has been debated for years between preservationists and government agencies and its eventual fate is still unclear.

==Flooding==
The lower and middle sections of the Klamath River are vulnerable to flooding, and major floods have occurred in years where major [[Floods in California |flooding has taken place in Northern California]], particularly in the wake of [[Pineapple Express]] storms that bring large amounts of warm rain to Northern California. Significant floods on the Klamath River have occurred in 1926<U+2013>1927, 1955, 1964, 1997, and 2005, in several cases changing the course of the river.<ref name=kbb>{{cite web|title=Floods on the Klamath River|url=http://www.klamathbucketbrigade.org/FloodsOnTheKlamathRiver090204.htm|publisher=Klamath Bucket Brigade|accessdate=2011-07-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Floods in northern California, January 1997|url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/1999/0073/report.pdf|publisher=U.S. Geological Survey|accessdate=2011-07-17|format=PDF|date=1999-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Stumpf-Foley|first=Marcie|title=Flood of 1997|url=http://www.goldgold.com/stories/flood97.htm|work=Gold and Treasure Hunter|publisher=The New 49ers|accessdate=2011-07-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Klamath River flood 2005<U+2013>2006|url=http://www.happycampnews.com/2006/klamath-river-flood-2005-2006.html|work=Happy Camp News|publisher=Klamath Design|accessdate=2011-07-17|location=[[Happy Camp, California]]}}</ref> The [[Christmas flood of 1964]] was particularly devastating, with a high water reaching {{convert|55|ft|m}}, inundating the towns of [[Klamath, California|Klamath]] and [[Klamath Glen, California|Klamath Glen]] and destroying most of the [[U.S. Route 101|Highway 101]] bridge crossing the river.

==Geology==
The Upper Klamath Basin, defined by the drainage area of the Klamath River above [[Iron Gate Dam (California)|Iron Gate Dam]], is a unique transitional area between the [[Cascade Range]] to the west and the [[Basin and Range Province]] of the northern [[Great Basin]] to the southeast. This region extends from the southern [[Lower Klamath Lake]] area into the [[Lost River (Oregon)|Lost River]] and [[Upper Klamath Lake]] basins. Crustal stretching and block faulting created a topography with characteristics similar to both regions. Almost the entire basin is a [[graben]] region, bearing basin and range characteristics, formed by uplifting and subsidence along several north<U+2013>south [[Fault (geology)|fault]]s.<ref name="upperbasingeology">{{cite web

The same age pattern is true in the Cascade Range and [[Klamath Mountains]] that cover the western half of the Klamath River watershed. As the [[North American Plate]] moved slowly southwestward over the past 10&nbsp;million years, successive oceanic [[terrane]]s dating from the [[Cambrian]] to the late [[Jurassic]] were added to the bulk of the North American continent.

==History==
===Early inhabitants and settlers===
[[Image:Klamath Falls6.jpg|thumb|left|Semi-nomadic tribes inhabited the upper basin, a portion of which is seen here]]
Human habitation on the Klamath dates to at least 7,000&nbsp;years ago. Many of the Native American groups along the river depended on the vast runs of [[Pacific salmon]], second only to that of the [[Columbia River]]. These tribes included the [[Yurok tribe|Yurok]], [[Hupa]], and [[Karuk]] along the canyons of the lower river and the [[Modoc people|Modoc]], [[Klamath people|Klamath]] and Yahooskin in the arid valleys of the upper basin. Controlling about {{convert|30|mi|km}} of the lower Klamath River and a large section of the Northern California [[West Coast of the United States|coast]], the Yurok were probably the most powerful tribe on the Klamath River and along with the Hupa and Karuk, caught salmon from the river with [[weir]]s, basket traps and even [[harpoon]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://lib.mnsu.edu/archives/fa/smhc/smhc219.html |title=MSU Archives Collection 219|publisher=Minnesota State University, Mankanto |date=2009-07-21 |accessdate=2011-07-27}}</ref><ref name="hist">{{cite web |author=Sabrina Litton |url=http://watershed.ucdavis.edu/scott_river/docs/reports/Sabrina_Litton.pdf |title=A Review of the History of Water Use throughout the Klamath River Basin |publisher=University of California Davis |work=Center for Watershed Sciences |date=Spring 2003 |accessdate=2010-05-19|format=PDF}}</ref>  One well-known ancient fishing ground is Ishi Pishi Falls, a set of [[rapids]] on the river near the confluence with the [[Salmon River (California)|Salmon River]].

The Klamath tribe's name came from the [[Chinookan languages|Upper Chinookan]] word ''/<U+026C><U+00E1>ma<U+026C>/'', literally "they of the river".<ref>Bright, p. 228</ref>

In the late 1820s, [[fur trapper]]s of the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] travelling south from [[Fort Vancouver]] reached the Klamath River basin. The first party to see the Klamath River was led by [[Alexander Roderick McLeod|Alexander McLeod]] in the winter of 1826<U+2013>1827. In 1828 [[Jedediah Smith]] reported beaver sign at the Klamath River mouth.<ref> {{cite journal |title=A Progress Report on Beaver Management in California |author=Arthur L. Hensley |journal=California Fish and Game |year=1946 |page=88 }}</ref> Within a matter of years, the plentiful [[beaver]]s in the Klamath basin had been mostly wiped out. [[Beaver dam]]s had previously been an important factor in stream habitat in the Klamath River watershed, helping to moderate the power of floods and creating extensive wetlands. The loss of the beaver dams resulted in detrimental consequences for watercourses in the basin, exacerbating the power of winter floods, and causing severe [[erosion]]. Trapping parties eventually moved southwest into the [[Sacramento Valley]] and blazed an extension of the [[Siskiyou Trail]], an early path between the [[Oregon Territory]] and [[San Francisco Bay]]. Despite the environmental implications, extensive and fertile [[meadow]]s left behind by the draining of beaver ponds attracted many settlers to the region later on.<ref name="hist"/><ref>Mackie, p. 66</ref>

===Early industry and development===
[[Image:Klamath (steamboat) PC 1908.JPG|thumb|right|The ''Klamath'' on Lower Klamath Lake, 1908]]
Beginning in the early 20th century, [[steamboat]]s began operating on Lower Klamath Lake between [[Siskiyou County, California]], and [[Klamath Falls, Oregon]]. The steamboats completed a link between a railroad [[branch line]] following the [[McCloud River]]<U+2014>the final part of which was called the Bartle Fast Freight Road, after [[Bartle, California]]. The end of this line, Laird's Landing, was the beginning of the Lower Klamath Lake steamboat line, which began operating with an {{convert|80|ft|m|sing=on}} screw steamer in 1905. By 1909, however, the railroad had circumnavigated Lower Klamath Lake directly to Klamath Falls. The steamboat line fell into disuse<U+2014>and much of Lower Klamath Lake was later drained and filled in.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.siskiyouhistory.org/1900_story1.html|title=Steamboats on Klamath Lake|publisher=www.siskiyouhistory.org|work=Siskiyou County History|date=|accessdate=2009-08-21}}</ref>

In the early 1910s and 1920s [[logging]] was a growing industry on the west side of the upper Klamath River valley, especially around Upper Klamath Lake. The [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern Railway]] and [[Southern Pacific Railroad]] built a joint-use line running along the eastern shore of the lake, delivering logs from the north side to a [[sawmill]] {{convert|3|mi|km}} downstream from the outlet of the lake. Many of the seasonal marshlands surrounding the lake and rivers were diked in this period to host lumber operations.<ref>''Balancing water: restoring the Klamath Basin'', p. 9</ref> In 1919, the first [[Link River Dam]], a timber crib dam, was constructed at the outlet of Upper Klamath Lake, raising it by about {{convert|16|ft|m}}. Steamboats continued mail, passenger and freight operations on Upper Klamath Lake until about 1928, in a period when many of the lumber companies shut down due to drought.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.klamathbucketbrigade.org/regulation_of_upper_klamath_lake.htm  |title= Regulation of Upper Klamath Lake|publisher=Klamath Bucket Brigade|date=| last= Boyle| first= John C|accessdate=2009-08-21}}</ref>

With lumber a declining industry in the upper Klamath Basin, the economy slowly transitioned to [[agriculture]]. The [[Klamath Reclamation Project]], established by the [[Bureau of Reclamation]] in the early 20th century, involved the construction of two dams on the river and additional dams on many of its tributaries, as well as the final draining of Lower Klamath and Tule Lakes.<ref name="Klamath County Museum">{{cite web|title=A brief historical overview of Klamath County, Oregon|url=http://www.co.klamath.or.us/museum/overview.pdf|publisher=Klamath County Museum|accessdate=2011-07-18|location=Klamath Falls, Oregon|pages=2<U+2013>3, 7|format=PDF|date=2010-10-01}}</ref> The Bureau of Reclamation was not the only user of the river during this period; in the late 1950s [[PacifiCorp]] and California-Oregon Power Company (COPCO) constructed three more dams on the river downstream.<ref name="George Kramer">{{cite web|last=Kramer|first=George|title=Klamath Hydroelectric Project: FERC No. 2082|url=http://www.pacificorp.com/content/dam/pacificorp/doc/Energy_Sources/Hydro/Hydro_Licensing/Klamath_River/Exhibit_E_Appendices_E_6E_Request_for_Determination_of_Eligibility_Text.pdf|publisher=PacifiCorp|accessdate=2011-07-18|location=Portland, Oregon|format=PDF|date=2003-10}}</ref> These dams, however, sparked a great controversy over water quality in the lower section of the river and the dependence of the river's annual salmon runs on it.<ref name="court case">{{cite web|title=Klamath Water v.

===Natural history===
[[Image:Klamath River mouth aerial view.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The mouth of the Klamath River on the Pacific Ocean, Del Norte County, California]]
The river is considered a prime habitat for [[Chinook salmon]], [[Coho salmon]], and [[rainbow trout]]. Once the river was the third-largest producer of salmon on the West Coast,<ref name="salmon"/> but today, only a fraction of the river's historic runs remain since the construction of six dams between 1908 and 1962. Coho salmon in the Klamath River are listed as threatened under the [[Endangered Species Act]]. In 1963, the upper Trinity River<U+2014>the largest single tributary to the Klamath<U+2014>was virtually removed from the Klamath drainage with the completion of the [[Lewiston Dam (California)|Lewiston]] and [[Trinity Dam]]s, diverting 90&nbsp;percent of the Trinity's flow to the Sacramento Valley. From 1963 to 1991, only {{convert|150|cuft/s|m3/s|1}} from the main stem above the dams was left to flow to the Klamath. In 1991, a minimum annual Trinity flow of {{convert|340000|acre feet|m3}} was established, or about {{convert|470|cuft/s|m3/s}}.<ref name="CVP" />

The possible removal of the dams has been a controversial issue in the region in recent years. Despite intense lobbying by local Native American tribes, conservationists, and fishermen, the 2004 renewal application by [[PacifiCorp]] for another 50-year federal operating license for the dams did not include any provisions for allowing salmon to return to more than {{convert|300|mi|km|0}} of former habitat above the dams.  In January 2007, however, the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] ruled that PacifiCorp must equip four dams with [[fish ladder]]s, a modification which would potentially cost more than $300&nbsp;million. PacifiCorp has offered $300&nbsp;million to upgrade the JC Boyle fish ladder and proposed trucking fish around the Copco #1 and Iron Gate dams, after having had been denied a license to build a power generator in Utah. PacifiCorp President Fehrman defended the company's activities in the area, pointing to other benefits.<ref>{{cite news | first = Jeff | last = Barnard | title = PacifiCorp willing to build fish ladders | agency = Associated Press | date = 2007-02-10 | url = http://www.triplicate.com/20070210102834/News/Local-News/PacifiCorp-willing-to-build-fish-ladders | accessdate = 2008-06-29 }}</ref>

A separate controversy surrounds the use of water in the Upper Klamath Basin for irrigated agriculture, which was temporarily halted in 2001 to protect endangered salmon and lake fish during a severe drought. Vice President [[Dick Cheney]] personally intervened to ensure water to the agriculture industry rather than to [[environmental flow]].<ref>{{cite news

According to biologists from the State of California and the [[U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcffa.org/KlamFishKillFactorsDFGReport.pdf| title = September 2002 Klamath River Fish-Kill: Final Analysis of Contributing Factors and Impacts | publisher=Pacific Coast Federation of Fishermen's Associations|date= 2004-07 |accessdate=2009-08-23}}</ref> the atypical low flow in the river along with high fish return numbers and high water temperatures allowed for a gill rot disease to kill at least 33,000&nbsp;salmon in September 2002, before they could reproduce.  The die-off was downstream of the Trinity inflow, and the salmon of the Trinity were impacted to a greater degree than the Klamath as the Trinity run was at its peak. The report does mention that the official fish die-off estimate of 34,056 is probably quite low and could be only half of the actual loss. Klamath River flows as measured at the river gauge in Keno show a low flow of {{convert|800|cuft/s|m3/s|1}} in September 1908 (before irrigation began).

====Water rights dispute====
In 1864, the Klamath Tribes signed a treaty that included them ceding about {{convert|20000000|acres|ha}} of their land, leaving much less water available to them in the basin. Then in the 1950s, Congress passed a bill that removed the tribes' federal recognition, but did not remove their water rights. In the 1970s, however, Congress repealed that bill. Klamath basin farmers twice sued the U.S. Department of the Interior in 2001, seeking to achieve access to more water for irrigating farms in the basin. The farmers lost each lawsuit.<ref name="klamathtribes.org">{{cite web|title=Klamath Tribes' water rights|publisher=The Klamath Tribes|url=http://www.klamathtribes.org/information/background/water.html|accessdate=2011-07-15}}</ref>

==Recreation==
[[Whitewater rafting]] and [[kayaking]] are popular recreational activities along the upper Klamath River below the [[J.C. Boyle Dam]], and also along the lower Klamath River downstream of the town of [[Happy Camp]]. There are long stretches<U+2014>over {{convert|100|mi|km}} in one instance<U+2014>of Class I<U+2013>II [[whitewater rapids]], while there are some Class III<U+2013>IV rapids in some of the narrower stretches. Below Weitchpec, the river slows down into a wider, deeper channel. About {{convert|13|mi|km}} of the river is designated Wild, and {{convert|175|mi|km}} Recreational.<ref>Palmer, p. 141</ref>

Recreational [[gold mining]] is popular along the Klamath and some of its tributaries, including the Salmon and the Trinity. Although simple methods such as [[Gold panning|panning]] are still used, some methods use suction pumps<U+2014>a practice involving turning over deposits of sediment and spreading them in order to find gold. Debates over the practice, which has further disturbed salmon spawning beds, continue to date.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.org/pdf_files/klamath.pdf|title=Klamath RiverKeeper Joins Suit to Stop Harmful Recreational Gold Mining|last=Bacher|first=Dan|publisher=www.columbia.org|work=Klamath RiverKeeper|date=2009-03-24|accessdate=2009-08-22}}</ref>

A variety of national forests and wildlife preserves<U+2014>including the [[Klamath National Forest]], [[Six Rivers National Forest]], [[Klamath National Wildlife Refuges Complex]], and [[Lower Klamath National Wildlife Refuge]]<U+2014>are located in the Klamath River watershed. The Klamath National Forest is located in Siskiyou County with a small portion in Oregon, and Six Rivers National Forest is located in the southern Klamath watershed, mostly in the Trinity River watershed. The latter two are located in the Upper Klamath Lake-Lower Klamath Lake area. [[Lava Beds National Monument]], which contains a large array of lava tubes and formations, is also in the Lower Klamath Lake area, to the south of the remnants of the lake.
