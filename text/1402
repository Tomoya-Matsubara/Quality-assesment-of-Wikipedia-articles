The [[United States Marine Corps]]' '''Maritime Special Purpose Force''', or ''MSPF'', are a unique specialized sub-unit that are drawn from the [[Marine Expeditionary Unit]]s' major subordinate elements.  They are [[United States Marine Corps Special Operations Capable Forces|special operations (capable) forces]] deployed to give the commanders low profile, two-platoon surgical emplacement in the accessible [[littoral]] regions.  The MSPF provides the enhanced operational capability and precision skills to complement, enable, and execute in selected [[conventional warfare|conventional]], maritime [[special operations]].  Or even in other operations that are not resident in traditional amphibious raid companies.

The MSPF provides the MEUs in rapid [[direct action (military)|direct action]] capabilities, to augmenting or replace the unavailable [[Fleet Marine Force Reconnaissance|Force Reconnaissance]], or ''Force Recon'', platoons.  It enables the Marine Corps's only [[deep reconnaissance|deep recon]] unit, Force Recon, to continue providing [[Fleet Marine Force|FMF-''level'']] [[reconnaissance]] without delay.

Although, they cannot operate independently of its parent MEU as it relies fully on the it for [[logistics]], [[intelligence]], [[communications]], [[transportation]], and [[fire support]].  However, they are capable of conducting operations with, or in support of the operators of the [[United States Special Operations Forces]].  The MSPF's task organization are often conformed as an addition of the [[Amphibious Ready Group]]<U+2019>s [[Naval Special Warfare]] task unit detachment.
