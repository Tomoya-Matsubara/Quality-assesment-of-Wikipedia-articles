The '''2014 Venezuela protests''' (also called '''12F'''<ref name="permiso">[http://www.infobae.com/2014/02/13/1543394-violencia-venezuela-maduro-anuncio-que-los-que-se-movilicen-sin-permiso-seran-detenidos Violencia en Venezuela: Maduro anunci<U+00F3> que los que se movilicen "sin permiso" ser<U+00E1>n detenidos].

CS Monitor</ref>) are a series of protests against the [[United Socialist Party of Venezuela|socialist]] government of Venezuela led by president [[Nicol<U+00E1>s Maduro]], began on February 12, 2014, organized by the leaders of the Venezuelan opposition [[Mar<U+00ED>a Corina Machado]] and [[Leopoldo L<U+00F3>pez]]<ref>[http://diariodecaracas.com/politica/leopoldo-lopez-maria-corina-machado-haran-anuncios-importantes-hoy-lasalida Esta fue la rueda de prensa de Leopoldo L<U+00F3>pez y Mar<U+00ED>a Corina Machado (Video)]</ref> and organized together with student movements. The alleged motivation of the protesters is the discontent before what they consider the violation of civil rights, chronic scarcity of goods, and high levels of criminal violence. The inflation for the previous year was 56.2%, the scarcity index had been near 20% throughout 2013 and a person is murdered every 21 minutes in Venezuela.<ref>{{cite news|title=Venezuela's Maduro says 2013 annual inflation was 56.2 pct|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/12/30/venezuela-inflation-annual-idUSL2N0K90V020131230|accessdate=19 January 2014|newspaper=Reuters|date=30 December 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Venezuela Inflation Hits 16-Year High as Shortages Rise|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-11-07/venezuela-inflation-hits-16-year-high-as-shortages-rise.html|accessdate=16 February 2014|newspaper=Bloomberg|date=7 November 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Castillo|first=Mariano|title=Beauty queen's killers nabbed, Venezuela says|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/01/09/world/americas/monica-spear-venezuela-beauty-queen-killed/|accessdate=10 January 2014|newspaper=CNN|date=9 January 2014}}</ref>

The day chosen for the call of civil disobedience coincides with the commemoration of the [[Battle of La Victoria (1812)|Battle of La Victoria]] of 12 February, 1814 during the [[Venezuelan War of Independence]], when the independence forces armed thousands of college and seminary students in the shortage of troops. This day is also known in Venezuela as Youth Day.

The presidential candidate of the [[Democratic Unity Roundtable|MUD]], [[Henrique Capriles]], has remained at the margin of the initiative of civil disobedience, only supporting peaceful protests. <ref name="permiso"/>

==Contested legitimacy of the government==
President Maduro won the election by a tight margin, with an alleged and unverifiable 1.5% of the vote separating him from the second candidate. The election was seeded with accusations of fraud and intimidation of voters,<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/venezuelan-president-accused-of-electoral-fraud-at-home-finds-backing-abroad/2013/05/10/15d607d8-b9a5-11e2-b568-6917f6ac6d9d_story.html |title=Venezuelan president, accused of electoral fraud at home, finds backing abroad |publisher=The Washington Post |date= |accessdate=2014-02-16}}</ref>  and a recount of the votes was demanded <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-22391980 |title=Capriles formally contests Venezuelan election result |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |accessdate=2014-02-16}}</ref> by the opposition leader [[Henrique Capriles]], and denied <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lavoz.com.ar/node/664609 |title=Venezuela: Tribunal niega posibilidad de un recuento <U+201C>voto a voto<U+201D> &#124; La Voz del Interior |publisher=Lavoz.com.ar |date=2013-08-20 |accessdate=2014-02-16}}</ref> by the [[National Electoral Council of Venezuela|electoral council]].

==Government response==
According to the government the protesters want to repeat the [[2002 Venezuelan coup d'<U+00E9>tat attempt|Venezuelan coup of 2002]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rt.com/news/venezuela-riots-kill-students-827/ |title=Venezuela coup?

Maduro's government organized pro-government demonstrations as well and announced that the anti-government protests remained prohibited. <ref name="permiso"/> This was because Venezuelan legislation requires a previous municipal permit for any public protest. The [[National Guard of Venezuela|GNB]], [[SEBIN]], and pro-government gangs responded to the protest violently with firearms and in some cases the military even used [[Combat vehicle|assault vehicles]] to fire on students.<ref>{{cite news|title=Three people dead in protest day in Venezuela|url=http://english.eluniversal.com/nacional-y-politica/140213/three-people-dead-in-protest-day-in-venezuela|accessdate=16 February 2014|newspaper=El Universal|date=13 February 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Marcela|first=Estrada|title=Venezuela: Opposition Rallies End in Bloodshed, Riots: Culpability Remains Contested amid Heavy Censorship, Infiltration Accusations|url=http://panampost.com/marcela-estrada/2014/02/13/venezuela-opposition-rallies-end-in-bloodshed-riots/|accessdate=16 February 2014|newspaper=PanAm Post|date=13 February 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Cowards!

The government recalled that the means of the transmission of images of violent protests in the media in the face of the law of communication of Venezuela (Law of Social Responsibility on Radio and Television) is prohibited, the cable signal of the international channel NTN24 was blocked in the country according to the government because of transmitting messages that incited to violence without the knowledge of the authorities, confirmed by president Maduro himself, who also noted the international agency [[AFP]] of being the head of a media manipulation. <ref>[http://actualidad.rt.com/actualidad/view/119859-maduro-denuncio-afp-cabeza-manipulacion-protestas Maduro: Denuncio a la Agencia France Press (AFP) porque est<U+00E1> a la cabeza de la manipulaci<U+00F3>n].

The deaths caused in the first demonstration led to further demonstrations, both opposing and supporting Maduro.<ref name="bbc"/>

==International reactions==
[[File:John Kerry official Secretary of State portrait.jpg|thumb|[[John Kerry]], United States Secretary of State, was concerned about the unrest in Venezuela.]] 
Many [[human rights]] groups and nations have been worried about the growing situation and use of excessive force in Venezuela.
