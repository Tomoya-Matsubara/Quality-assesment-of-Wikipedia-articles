'''Remedios de Escalada de San Mart<U+00ED>n''' is a city located in [[Buenos Aires Province]], [[Argentina]], within [[Lan<U+00FA>s Partido]], [[Gran Buenos Aires]]. It covers an area of 9,95&nbsp;km<U+00B2> and the population was 81,465 in 2001; the demonym for its inhabitants is "escaladense."

==History==

The town was first established by Agust<U+00ED>n Eguren as ''Ed<U+00E9>n Argentino'' ("Argentine Eden"), a [[bedroom community]], in 1873. Its population remained in the few hundreds until, in 1890, the [[Buenos Aires Great Southern Railway]] inaugurated a [[rail yard]] in the adjoining Villa Gal<U+00ED>ndez, to the east; ''La Fraternidad'', one of Argentina's first and oldest [[trade union]]s, was founded by workers at the site in 1887. Further such installations opened by Eliseo Ram<U+00ED>rez and the Ram<U+00ED>rez de Lafuente family in 1901 made the area a prime [[Rail transport in Argentina|rail operations]] hub, and the Great Southern inaugurated its first commuter station there in 1902.

The [[Club Atl<U+00E9>tico Talleres de Remedios de Escalada]], the town's first [[soccer|football]] club, was established in 1906, and plays in the lower leagues of [[Football in Argentina|Argentine football]]. The town became home to a sizable community of [[Italian Argentine]]s in the subsequent years, and prominent among these was Luis M<U+00E1>spero, who operated one of the country's largest [[hat]] factories, and V<U+00ED>ctor Marangoni, owner of an important [[metalworks]] establishment; the Italian Mutual Insurance and Assistance Company was established here in 1913.

A number of important [[cooperative]]s, notably ''El Hogar Argentino'' (1911) and ''La Internacional'' (1914), opened in the town during that era, as did ''La Idea'', a news daily, in 1915, and the Uni<U+00F3>n Ferroviaria, a nationally prominent [[yellow union]] organized as a counterweight to the intransigent La Fraternidad, in 1921. The [[Roman Catholic]] Parish of ''Nuestra Se<U+00F1>ora de los Remedios'' ("Our Lady of Remedies") was consecrated in 1924, and in 1933, Villa Gal<U+00ED>ndez and the Argentine Eden were incorporated as ''Remedios de Escalada'' (in honor of [[Mar<U+00ED>a de los Remedios de Escalada]], wife of the leader of the [[Argentine War of Independence]], General [[Jos<U+00E9> de San Mart<U+00ED>n]]).

Remedios de Escalada was formally declared a city by the Buenos Aires Province Legislature in 1974. The city later suffered from the effects of a failed plan in during the 1976-83 dictatorship to expand the [[Avenida General Paz|General Paz Freeway]] from the [[Villa Riachuelo]] ward in [[Buenos Aires]] to the city of [[Avellaneda]]; never completed, the demolitions resulting from the project left an extensive swath along the city of empty lots which, in many cases, were not adequately reurbanized. The [[National University of Lan<U+00FA>s]], one of the smaller [[List of universities in Argentina|national universities]], was established here in 1995.
