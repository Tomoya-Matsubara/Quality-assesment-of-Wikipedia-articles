{{nihongo|'''Yasuo Yamada'''|<U+5C71><U+7530> <U+5EB7><U+96C4>|Yamada Yasuo}} ([[10 September]] [[1932]]-[[19 March]] [[1995]]) was a [[Japan]]ese voice [[actor]].

Yamada left the faculty of literature of [[Waseda University]], and has performed in many stage, radio, and television productions. His most famous role was [[Ars<U+00E8>ne Lupin III]] from the [[Lupin III]] series, starting in 1971 and ending in 1995. He also provided the Japanese dubbed voice for [[Clint Eastwood]] and [[Jean-Paul Belmondo]].  

At the age of 62, Yasuo Yamada died of a [[Stroke|brain hemorrhage]]. At the end of the credits of the film ''[[Farewell to Nostradamus]]'' (the first Lupin film without Yasuo), there is a tribute: "To Yasuo Yamada, Eternal Lupin the Third: Thank you!" (the message was removed from the first angle of the [[English language]] DVD release by [[Funimation]]). 

Since Yasuo's death, [[Kanichi Kurita]] has taken over the role of Lupin the Third. As his last will, Yasuo requested Kurita to replace him, if he were to pass on.
