To Lincoln's right is his bodyguard, [[Ward Hill Lamon]].]] The '''Gettysburg Address''' is a speech by [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Abraham Lincoln]] and is one of the best-known speeches in [[history of the United States|United States history]].<ref>Historian [[James M. McPherson|James McPherson]] has called it "The most eloquent expression of the new birth of freedom brought forth by reform liberalism.", in McPherson, James M. ''Drawn with the Sword: Reflections on the American Civil War'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1996. p. 185. Google Book Search. Retrieved on November 27, 2007.</ref> It was delivered by Lincoln during the [[American Civil War]], on the afternoon of Thursday, November 19, 1863, at the dedication of the [[Gettysburg National Cemetery|Soldiers' National Cemetery]] in [[Gettysburg, Pennsylvania]], four and a half months after the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] armies defeated those of the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] at the decisive [[Battle of Gettysburg]].

Abraham Lincoln's carefully crafted address, secondary to other presentations that day, came to be regarded as one of the greatest [[speeches]] in American history. In just over two minutes, Lincoln invoked the principles of human equality espoused by the [[Declaration of Independence (United States)|Declaration of Independence]] and redefined the Civil War as a struggle not merely for the [[United States|Union]], but as "a new birth of [[Freedom (political)|freedom]]" that would bring true equality to all of its citizens, and that would also create a unified nation in which [[states' rights]] were no longer dominant.

Beginning with the now-iconic phrase "Four [[20 (number)|score]] and seven years ago," referring to the [[American Revolution]] of 1776, Lincoln examined the founding principles of the United States in the context of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], and used the ceremony at Gettysburg as an opportunity not only to consecrate the grounds of a cemetery, but also to exhort the listeners to ensure the survival of America's representative democracy, that the "government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth."

Despite the speech's prominent place in the history and popular culture of the United States, the exact wording of the speech is disputed. The five known manuscripts of the Gettysburg Address differ in a number of details and also differ from contemporary newspaper reprints of the speech.

Interring the dead in a dignified and orderly manner became a high priority for the few thousand residents of Gettysburg. Initially, the town planned to buy land for a cemetery and then ask the families of the dead to pay for their burial. However, [[David Wills (Gettysburg)|David Wills]], a wealthy 32-year-old attorney, objected to this idea and wrote to the Governor of Pennsylvania, [[Andrew Gregg Curtin]], suggesting instead a National Cemetery to be funded by the states. Wills was authorized to purchase {{convert|17|acre|ha|lk=on}} for a cemetery to honor those lost in the battle, paying $2,475.87 for the land (${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|2475.87|1863|r=-1}}}} as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}).<ref>Murphy, pp. 98<U+2013>99.</ref>

== Political significance ==
By August 1863, the casualty lists from [[American Civil War|Civil War]] battles included a quarter of a million names. As a result, anti-war and anti-Lincoln sentiments grew in the North.<ref>[http://cdl.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/moa/pageviewer?frames=1&cite=http%3A%2F%2Fcdl.library.cornell.edu%2Fcgi-bin%2Fmoa%2Fmoa-cgi%3Fnotisid%3DABS9288-0001-44&coll=moa&root=%2Fmoa%2Foldg%2Foldg0001%2F&tif=00145.TIF&view=pdf "How We are Revenging Sumpter," May, 1863.]</ref> Peace [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] known as [[Copperheads]] were eager to oust Lincoln in the [[United States presidential election, 1864|1864 election]] in order to end the war through concessions to the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]], and Lincoln's 1863 [[conscription|drafts]] were highly unpopular. Hatred for Lincoln's draft climaxed just ten days after the Battle of Gettysburg with the [[New York Draft Riots]]. In September 1863, Pennsylvania's Governor Curtin warned Lincoln that political sentiments were turning against the war effort:<ref>[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/mal:@field(DOCID+@lit(d2604300)) Andrew Curtin to Abraham Lincoln, Sept. 4, 1863 (Library of Congress)]</ref>

{{quote|If the election were to occur now, the result would be extremely doubtful, and although most of our discreet friends are sanguine of the result, my impression is, the chances would be against us. The draft is very odious in the State... the Democratic leaders have succeeded in exciting prejudice and passion, and have infused their poison into the minds of the people to a very large extent, and the changes are against us.}}

The following year the Presidential election would be held, and Lincoln was quite concerned that the [[Copperheads]] might prevail. Well into the summer of 1864, Lincoln remained convinced that the opposition would oust him.<ref>{{cite book

== Program and Everett's "Gettysburg Oration" ==
[[File:Edward Everett.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Edward Everett]] delivered a two-hour Oration before Lincoln's few minutes of dedicatory remarks.]]
{{wikisourcepar|Gettysburg Oration}}
The program organized for that day by Wills and his committee included:
:Music, by Birgfield's Band
:Prayer, by Reverend T.H. Stockton, D.D.
:Music, by the [[United States Marine Band|Marine Band]]
:Oration, by Hon. [[Edward Everett]]
:Music, Hymn composed by B.B. French, Esq.
:Dedicatory Remarks, by the President of the United States
:Dirge, sung by Choir selected for the occasion
:Benediction, by [[Henry Louis Baugher|Reverend H.L. Baugher, D.D.]]<ref name="wills" />

While it is Lincoln's short speech that has gone down in history as one of the finest examples of English public oratory, it was Everett's two-hour oration that was slated to be the "Gettysburg address" that day. His now seldom-read 13,607-word oration began:

[[File:Everett 1864 AbeLincoln's GettysburgAddress.JPG|thumb|right|''Lincoln's'' <u>Gettysburg Address</u> as printed in Everett's 1864 book]]In 1864, Little, Brown & Company published Everett's book entitled,  

''Address of the Hon. Edward Everett At the Consecration of the National Cemetery At Gettysburg, 19th November 1863, with the Dedicatory Speech of President Lincoln, and the Other Exercises of the Occasion; Accompanied by An Account of the Origin of the Undertaking and of the Arrangement of the Cemetery Grounds, and by a Map of the Battle-field and a Plan of the Cemetery''.

[[File:Everett 1864 TitlePage and Battle Map.JPG|thumb|left|''Battle Map and Title Page '' from Everett's 1864 book]]

As indicated in its title, the book actually includes a true printing of Abraham Lincoln's famous <u>Gettysburg Address</u>. 

It presents Everett's accounting of the ''Gettysburg Battle'' as portrayed by its accompanying, highly detailed ''Battle Map''.

The book includes an excellent illustration of the proposed cemetery site.  It is supplemented by exhibits of important letters pertaining to the consecration ceremony, as written by General George G. Meade and others; and it recounts the sequence of dignitaries who partook in the Procession which took place.<ref>[http://truescans.com/index-Lincoln.htm '''TrueScans''' of Edward Everett's Book -- including the <u>Gettysburg Address</u>]; 1864, Little, Brown & Company]</ref>

Smith, in "Criticism of Political Rhetoric and Disciplinary Integrity", suggested Lincoln's view of the government as expressed in the Gettysburg Address was influenced by the noted speech of Massachusetts [[United States Senator|Senator]] [[Daniel Webster]], the [[Webster-Hayne debate|"Second Reply to Hayne"]], in which Webster famously thundered "Liberty and Union, now and forever, one and inseparable!"<ref>{{cite journal|author=Smith, Craig|journal=American Communication Journal|volume=4|issue=1|date=Fall greger2000|title=Criticism of Political Rhetoric and Disciplinary Integrity|url=http://www.acjournal.org/holdings/vol4/iss1/special/smith.htm |accessdate=2007-11-26 }}</ref> Specifically, in this January 26, 1830 speech before the [[United States Senate]], Webster described the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] as: "made for the people, made by the people, and answerable to the people," foreshadowing Lincoln's "government of the people, by the people, for the people."<ref name=Dartmouth>{{cite web|work=Daniel Webster: Dartmouth's Favorite Son |title=The Second Reply to Hayne (January 26<U+2013>27, 1830) |url=http://www.dartmouth.edu/~dwebster/speeches/hayne-speech.html |accessdate=2007-11-30|publisher=Dartmouth }}  Webster himself may have been relying on earlier use of similar language.  For example, [[John Hobhouse, 1st Baron Broughton]] had employed similar phraseology in 1819: "I am a man chosen for the people, by the people; and, if elected, I will do no other business than that of the people."  See Broughton, John and Burdett, Francis.

It is not the creature of State legislatures; nay, more, if the whole truth must be told, the people brought it into existence, established it, and have hitherto supported it, for the very purpose, amongst others, of imposing certain salutary restraints on State sovereignties."<ref name=Dartmouth/>

Wills observed Lincoln's usage of the imagery of birth, life, and death in reference to a nation "brought forth," "conceived," and that shall not "perish."<ref>{{cite journal|author=Vosmeier, Matthew Noah|journal=Lincoln Lore|title=Lincoln and the 'Central Idea of the Occasion': Garry Wills's Lincoln at Gettysburg: The Words that Remade America.|url=http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/jala/15.2/williams.html|publisher=The Lincoln Museum|accessdate=2009-11-09|date=January/February 1992}}</ref> Others, including [[Allen C.

== Five manuscripts ==
{{wikisource}}The five known manuscript copies of the Gettysburg Address are each named for the associated person who received it from Lincoln. Lincoln gave a copy to each of his private secretaries, [[John Nicolay]] and [[John Hay]].<ref name="johnson" /> Both of these drafts were written around the time of his November 19 address, while the other three copies of the address, the Everett, Bancroft, and Bliss copies, were written by Lincoln for charitable purposes well after November 19.<ref>{{cite web|author=Rao, Maya|work=Cornell Daily Sun|date=April 6, 2005|url=http://cornellsun.com/node/14486|title=C.U.

There, he asked Lincoln for a hand-written copy of the address, and that manuscript is now the highlight of Cornell University Library's Division of Rare and Manuscript Collections."

The two earliest drafts of the Address are associated with some confusion and controversy regarding their existence and provenance. Nicolay and Hay were appointed custodians of Lincoln's papers by Lincoln's son [[Robert Todd Lincoln]] in 1874.<ref name="johnson" /> After appearing in [[facsimile]] in an article written by John Nicolay in 1894, the Nicolay Copy was presumably among the papers passed to Hay by Nicolay's daughter Helen upon Nicolay's death in 1901. Robert Lincoln began a search for the original copy in 1908, which resulted in the discovery of a handwritten copy of the Gettysburg Address among the bound papers of John Hay<U+2014>a copy now known as the "Hay Draft."<ref name="johnson" />

The Hay Draft differed from the version of the Gettysburg Address published by John Nicolay in 1894 in a number of significant ways: it was written on a different type of paper, had a different number of words per line and number of lines, and contained editorial revisions in Lincoln's hand.<ref name="johnson" />

Both the Hay and Nicolay copies of the Address are within the Library of Congress, encased in specially designed, temperature-controlled, sealed containers with [[argon]] gas in order to protect the documents from oxidation and continued deterioration.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Library of Congress|title=Preservation of the drafts of the Gettysburg Address at the Library of Congress |url=http://myloc.gov/Exhibitions/GettysburgAddress/Pages/Preservation.aspx?sc_id=wikip|accessdate=2010-09-15 }}</ref>

=== Nicolay Copy ===
The Nicolay Copy{{Ref label|Nicolay|a|a}} is often called the "first draft" because it is believed to be the earliest copy that exists.<ref name="nicolay">Nicolay, J. "Lincoln's Gettysburg Address," ''Century Magazine'' 47 (February 1894): 596<U+2013>608, cited by Johnson, Martin P.

In an 1894 article that included a facsimile of this copy, Nicolay, who had become the custodian of Lincoln's papers, wrote that Lincoln had brought to Gettysburg the first part of the speech written in ink on [[The White House|Executive Mansion]] stationery, and that he had written the second page in pencil on lined paper before the dedication on November 19.<ref name="nicolay"/> Matching folds are still evident on the two pages, suggesting it could be the copy that eyewitnesses say Lincoln took from his coat pocket and read at the ceremony.<ref name="GA drafts" /><ref name="Prochnow">Sandburg, Carl.

''Great Stories from Great Lives'' Freeport: Books for Libraries Press, 1944. ISBN 0-8369-2018-X, p. 13: "The ''Cincinnati Commercial'' reporter wrote 'The President rises slowly, draws from his pocket a paper...[and] reads the brief and pithy remarks."</ref> Others believe that the delivery text has been lost, because some of the words and phrases of the Nicolay Copy do not match contemporary transcriptions of Lincoln's original speech.<ref>Wills, Garry. Appendix I: "this text does not have three important phrases that the joint newspaper accounts prove he actually spoke," and "there is no physical impossibility that this is the delivery text, but it is... unlikely that it is."</ref>  The words "under God", for example, are missing in this copy from the phrase "that this nation (under God) shall have a new birth of freedom..." In order for the Nicolay draft to have been the reading copy, either the contemporary transcriptions were inaccurate, or Lincoln would have had to depart from his written text in several instances. This copy of the Gettysburg Address apparently remained in John Nicolay's possession until his death in 1901, when it passed to his friend and colleague John Hay.<ref name="johnson" /> It used to be on display as part of the American Treasures exhibition of the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C.<ref>[http://www.loc.gov/exhibits/treasures/tr00.html Top Treasures.] American Treasures of the Library of Congress. Retrieved on 2007-12-10.</ref>

=== Hay Copy ===
[[File:Haycopy-1.jpg|right|thumb|The Hay Copy, with [[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln's]] handwritten corrections]]
The existence of the Hay Copy{{Ref label|Hay|b|b}} was first announced to the public in 1906, after the search for the "original manuscript" of the Address among the papers of John Hay brought it to light.<ref name="johnson"/> Significantly, it differs somewhat from the manuscript of the Address described by John Hay in his article, and contains numerous omissions and inserts in Lincoln's own hand, including omissions critical to the basic meaning of the sentence, not simply words that would be added by Lincoln to strengthen or clarify their meaning. In this copy, as in the Nicolay Copy, the words "under God" are not present.

This version has been described as "the most inexplicable" of the drafts and is sometimes referred to as the "second draft."<ref name="GA drafts"/><ref>David Mearns, "Unknown at this Address," in Lincoln and the Gettysburg Address: Commemorative Papers, ed. Allan Nevins (Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1964), 133; Mearns and Dunlap, caption describing the facsimile of the Hay text in Long Remembered.; both cited in Johnson, "Who Stole the Gettysburg Address."</ref> The "Hay Copy" was made either on the morning of the delivery of the Address, or shortly after Lincoln's return to Washington. Those that believe that it was completed on the morning of his address point to the fact that it contains certain phrases that are not in the first draft but are in the reports of the address as delivered and in subsequent copies made by Lincoln. It is probable, they conclude, that, as stated in the explanatory note accompanying the original copies of the first and second drafts in the [[Library of Congress]], Lincoln held this second draft when he delivered the address.<ref name="gnmp">{{cite web|publisher=United States Department of the Interior, National Park Service|title=Gettysburg National Military Park|url=http://www.pueblo.gsa.gov/cic_text/misc/gettysburg/g2.htm|accessdate=2007-12-03}}

=== Everett Copy ===
The Everett Copy,{{Ref label|Everett|c|c}} also known as the "Everett-Keyes Copy," was sent by President Lincoln to [[Edward Everett]] in early 1864, at Everett's request. Everett was collecting the speeches at the Gettysburg dedication into one bound volume to sell for the benefit of stricken soldiers at New York's [[United States Sanitary Commission|Sanitary Commission Fair]]. The draft Lincoln sent became the third autograph copy, and is now in the possession of the Illinois State Historical Library in [[Springfield, Illinois]],<ref name="gnmp"/> where it is currently on display in the Treasures Gallery of the [[Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum]].

=== Bancroft Copy ===
The Bancroft Copy{{Ref label|Bancroft|d|d}} of the Gettysburg Address was written out by President Lincoln in February 1864 at the request of [[George Bancroft]], the famed historian and former [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Secretary of the Navy]] whose comprehensive ten volume ''History of the United States'' later led him to be known as the "father of American History."<ref>{{cite web|title=George Bancroft|accessdate=2007-12-19|publisher=Encyclopedia Britannica Online|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9012106/George-Bancroft}}</ref><ref>See also: {{cite encyclopedia|url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761553688/George_Bancroft.html|accessdate=2007-12-19|title=George Bancroft|publisher=Encarta|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5kwpstnKC|archivedate=2009-10-31|deadurl=yes}}</ref> Bancroft planned to include this copy in ''Autograph Leaves of Our Country's Authors'', which he planned to sell at a Soldiers' and Sailors' Sanitary Fair in [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]]. As this fourth copy was written on both sides of the paper, it proved unusable for this purpose, and Bancroft was allowed to keep it. This manuscript is the only one accompanied both by a letter from Lincoln transmitting the manuscript and by the original envelope addressed and [[franking|franked]] by Lincoln.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rmc.library.cornell.edu/gettysburg/good_cause.htm|title=Gettysburg Address|publisher=Cornell University Library|accessdate=2007-12-19}}</ref> This copy remained in the Bancroft family for many years, was sold to various dealers and purchased by Nicholas and Marguerite Lilly Noyes,<ref>{{cite web|title=Founding Collections: Nicholas H.

It is now held by the Division of Rare and Manuscript Collections in the Carl A.

Holds Gettysburg Address Manuscript |url=http://cornellsun.com/node/14486 |date=April 6, 2005 |accessdate=2005-12-18 }}</ref>

=== Bliss Copy ===
Discovering that his fourth written copy could not be used, Lincoln then wrote a fifth draft, which was accepted for the purpose requested. The Bliss Copy,{{Ref label|Bliss|e|e}} named for Colonel [[Alexander Bliss]], Bancroft's stepson and publisher of ''Autograph Leaves'', is the only draft to which Lincoln affixed his signature. Lincoln is not known to have made any further copies of the Gettysburg Address. Because of the apparent care in its preparation, and in part because Lincoln provided a title and signed and dated this copy, it has become the standard version of the address and the source for most facsimile reproductions of Lincoln's Gettysburg Address.  It is the version that is inscribed on the South wall of the Lincoln Memorial<ref name="hand"/>

This draft now hangs in the [[Lincoln Room]] of the [[White House]], a gift of [[Oscar B. Cintas]], former [[Cuba]]n Ambassador to the United States.<ref name="gnmp" /> Cintas, a wealthy collector of art and manuscripts, purchased the Bliss Copy at a public [[auction]] in 1949 for $54,000 (${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|54000|1949|r=-3}}}} as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}), at that time the highest price ever paid for a document at public auction.<ref>{{cite web |title=About Cintas: Oscar B. Cintas|publisher=Oscar B. Cintas foundation|url=http://www.cintasfoundation.org/about_oscar.htm |accessdate=2007-12-10}}</ref>  Cintas' properties were claimed by the [[Fidel Castro|Castro government]] after the [[Cuban Revolution]] in 1959, but Cintas, who died in 1957, willed the Gettysburg Address to the American people, provided it would be kept at the White House, where it was transferred in 1959.<ref>{{cite news|author=Boritt, Gabor|work=The Wall Street Journal|date=November 16, 2006|page=D6|url=http://www.opinionjournal.com/la/?id=110009250|title=Change of Address: The Gettysburg Drafts|accessdate=2006-12-04}}</ref>

Garry Wills concluded the Bliss Copy "is stylistically preferable to others in one significant way: Lincoln removed 'here' from 'that cause for which they (here) gave...' The seventh 'here' is in all other versions of the speech." Wills noted the fact that Lincoln "was still making such improvements," suggesting Lincoln was more concerned with a perfected text than with an 'original' one.

=== Others ===
Another contemporary source of the text is the [[Associated Press]] dispatch, transcribed from the shorthand notes taken by reporter Joseph L. Gilbert. It also differs from the drafted text in a number of minor ways.<ref>Bryan, William Jennings, ed. 1906. ''The World's Famous Orations'' Vol. IX. America: II. (1818<U+2013>1865). {{cite web |title=V. The Speech at Gettysburg by Abraham Lincoln.|url=http://www.bartleby.com/268/9/26.html#txt2 |accessdate=2005-12-18 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|publisher=Associated Press.org|work=History/Archives: The Associated Press|title=1846 - 1900: The News Cooperative Takes Shape|url=http://www.ap.org/pages/about/history/history_first.html |accessdate=2007-11-30 }}</ref>

== Contemporary sources and reaction ==
[[File:Gettysburg Address, New York Times.jpg|right|thumb|The ''[[New York Times]]'' article from November 20, 1863, indicates Lincoln's speech was interrupted five times by applause and was followed by "long continued applause."<ref name="NYT"/>]]

Eyewitness reports vary as to their view of Lincoln's performance. In 1931, the printed recollections of 87-year-old Mrs. Sarah A. Cooke Myers, who at the age of 19 was present, suggest a dignified silence followed Lincoln's speech: "I was close to the President and heard all of the Address, but it seemed short. Then there was an impressive silence like our Menallen [[Quaker|Friends Meeting]]. There was no applause when he stopped speaking."<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Abraham Lincoln online|work=Recollections of Abraham Lincoln at Gettysburg|author=Hark, Ann|title=Mrs. John T. Myers Relives the Day She Met the Great Emancipator|url=http://showcase.netins.net/web/creative/lincoln/news/recollect.htm |accessdate=2007-11-30 }} Citing the ''Philadelphia Public Ledger'' of February 7, 1932.</ref> According to historian [[Shelby Foote]], after Lincoln's presentation, the applause was delayed, scattered, and "barely polite."<ref>{{cite book |authorlink=Shelby Foote |last=Foote |first=Shelby |title=The Civil War, A Narrative: Fredericksburg to Meridian |publisher=Random House |year= 1958 |isbn=0-394-49517-9 }}</ref> In contrast, [[List of Governors of Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania Governor]] Curtin maintained, "He pronounced that speech in a voice that all the multitude heard. The crowd was hushed into silence because the President stood before them...It was so Impressive! It was the common remark of everybody. Such a speech, as they said it was!"<ref name=AtCemetery/>

In an oft-repeated legend, Lincoln is said to have turned to his bodyguard [[Ward Hill Lamon]] and remarked that his speech, like a bad plow, "won't scour." According to Garry Wills, this statement has no basis in fact and largely originates from the unreliable recollections of Lamon.<ref name="wills" /> In Garry Wills's view, "{{interpolation|Lincoln}} had done what he wanted to do {{interpolation|at Gettysburg}}."

In a letter to Lincoln written the following day, Everett praised the President for his eloquent and concise speech, saying, "I should be glad if I could flatter myself that I came as near to the central idea of the occasion, in two hours, as you did in two minutes."<ref name=Simon41>Simon, ''et al.'', eds. ''The Lincoln Forum: Abraham Lincoln, Gettysburg, and the Civil War.''  Mason City: Savas Publishing Company, 1999. ISBN 1-882810-37-6, p. 41</ref> Lincoln replied that he was glad to know the speech was not a "total failure".<ref name=Simon41/>

Other public reaction to the speech was divided along partisan lines. The next day the Democratic-leaning ''[[Chicago Times]]'' observed, "The cheek of every American must tingle with shame as he reads the silly, flat and dishwatery utterances of the man who has to be pointed out to intelligent foreigners as the President of the United States." In contrast, the Republican-oriented ''New York Times'' was complimentary.<ref name="NYT" /> The [[Springfield, Massachusetts|Springfield, Ma.]] [[The Republican|Republican]] newspaper printed the entire speech, calling it "a perfect gem" that was "deep in feeling, compact in thought and expression, and tasteful and elegant in every word and comma." The Republican predicted that Lincoln's brief remarks would "repay further study as the model speech".<ref>name=Prochow, Herbert Victor, "Great Stories from Great Lives," Harper & Brothers, 1944, pge 17</ref>

=== Audio recollections ===
[[William R. Rathvon]] is the only known eyewitness of both Lincoln's arrival at Gettysburg and the address itself to have left an audio recording of his recollections.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1045619|title=Gettysburg Eyewitness - Lost and Found Sound: The Boy Who Heard Lincoln|publisher=NPR|accessdate=2009-09-07}}</ref> One year before his death in 1939, Rathvon's reminiscences were recorded on February 12, 1938 at the Boston studios of radio station WRUL, including his reading the address, itself, and a 78 rpm record was pressed. The title of the 78 record was "I Heard Lincoln That Day - William R. Rathvon, TR Productions."

=== Photographs ===
The only known and confirmed photograph of Lincoln at Gettysburg,<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Library of Congress|url=http://myloc.gov/Exhibitions/gettysburgaddress/exhibitionitems/ExhibitObjects/LincolnOnPlatform.aspx?sc_id=wikip|title=The Only Known Photograph of President Lincoln at the dedication of the Civil War cemetery at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, November 19, 1863|accessdate=2010-09-15}}</ref> taken by photographer [[David Bachrach]]<ref>{{cite web |title=Bachrach in the news|publisher=Bachrach photography |url=http://www.bachrachinc.com/html/in_the_news.html |accessdate=2007-12-03 }}</ref> was identified in the [[Mathew Brady]] collection of photographic plates in the [[National Archives and Records Administration]] in 1952. While Lincoln's speech was short and may have precluded multiple pictures of him while speaking, he and the other dignitaries sat for hours during the rest of the program. Given the length of Everett's speech and the length of time it took for 19th century photographers to get "set up" before taking a picture, it is quite plausible that the photographers were ill prepared for the brevity of Lincoln's remarks.

In 2006, Civil War enthusiast John Richter was credited with identifying two additional photographs in the Library of Congress collection that potentially show President Lincoln in the procession at Gettysburg.<ref>{{cite news|author=Toppo, Greg|work=USA Today|date=November 15, 2007|url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2007-11-15-lincoln_N.htm|title=Honestly, is that really Abe in 3-D?|accessdate=2007-12-03}}</ref>

=== Usage of "under God" ===
The words "under God" do not appear in the Nicolay and Hay drafts but are included in the three later copies (Everett, Bancroft, and Bliss). Accordingly, some [[skeptic]]s maintain that Lincoln did not utter the words "under God" at Gettysburg.<ref>{{cite web|author=Walker, Cliff (ed.) |publisher=Positive Atheism|month=September | year=2002 |title=Lincoln's Gettysburg 'Under God': Another case of 'retrofitting'?

Wrong."</ref>  However, at least three reporters [[telegraph]]ed the text of Lincoln's speech on the day the Address was given with the words "under God" included. Historian William E. Barton argues that:<ref>Barton, pp. 138<U+2013>139</ref>

{{quote|Every stenographic report, good, bad and indifferent, says 'that the nation shall, under God, have a new birth of freedom.' There was no common source from which all the reporters could have obtained those words but from Lincoln's own lips at the time of delivery. It will not do to say that [Secretary of War] Stanton suggested those words after Lincoln's return to Washington, for the words were telegraphed by at least three reporters on the afternoon of the delivery.}}

The reporters present included Joseph Gilbert, from the [[Associated Press]]; [[Charles Hale]], from the ''Boston Advertiser'';<ref>Prochnow, p. 14</ref> [[John Russell Young|John R. Young]] (who later became the [[Librarian of Congress]]), from the ''[[Philadelphia Press]]''; and reporters from the ''Cincinnati Commercial'',<ref>Prochnow, p. 13</ref> ''New York Tribune'',<ref name=Prochnow15>Prochnow, p. 15</ref> and ''New York Times''.<ref name=Prochnow15/> Charles Hale "had notebook and pencil in hand, [and] took down the slow-spoken words of the President".<ref>Sandburg, Carl.  "Lincoln Speaks at Gettysburg."  In: ''Abraham Lincoln: The War Years'' (1939) New York: Harcourt, Brace & Company. II, 452-457; cited by Prochnow, p. 14.</ref> "He took down what he declared was the exact language of Lincoln's address, and his declaration was as good as the oath of a court stenographer. His associates confirmed his testimony, which was received, as it deserved to be at its face value."<ref>Barton, p. 81</ref>  The most logical explanation is that Lincoln deviated from his prepared text and inserted the phrase when he spoke.

== Legacy ==
[[File:Lincoln Memorial (south wall interior).jpg|thumb|right|The words of the Gettysburg Address can be seen carved into the south wall of the interior of the [[Lincoln Memorial]], designed by [[Henry Bacon]] and sculpted and painted by [[Daniel Chester French]] and [[Jules Guerin]], respectively.]]

The importance of the Gettysburg Address in the history of the United States is underscored by its enduring presence in American culture. In addition to its prominent place carved into a stone [[cella]] on the south wall of the [[Lincoln Memorial]] in Washington, D.C., the Gettysburg Address is frequently referred to in works of popular culture, with the implicit expectation that contemporary audiences will be familiar with Lincoln's words.

In the many generations that have passed since the Address, it has remained among the most famous speeches in American history.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[United States Department of State]]|title=Outline of U.S. History|page=73|url=http://www.america.gov/st/educ-english/2008/April/20080407120920eaifas0.4535639.html|accessdate=2009-01-03}}</ref> Lincoln's Gettysburg Address is itself referenced in another of those famed orations, [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]]'s "[[I Have a Dream]]" speech.<ref>{{cite web|title=Martin Luther King Jr: the March, the Man, the Dream.|url=http://www.america.gov/st/pubs-english/2003/August/20050711151842pssnikwad0.3846247.html|accessdate=2009-11-09|last=Garrow|first=David J.|publisher=''American History'' magazine|date=August 2003|quote=[F]our days before the [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom|March]] [King] told Al Duckett, a black journalist...that his August 28 oration needed to be "sort of a Gettysburg Address."}}</ref>  Standing on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial in August 1963, King began with a reference to President Lincoln and his enduring words: "Five score years ago, a great American, in whose symbolic shadow we stand today, signed the [[Emancipation Proclamation]]. This momentous decree came as a great beacon light of hope to millions of Negro slaves who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice."

The [[Constitution of France]] (under the [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic]] established in 1958) states that the principle of the [[France|Republic of France]] is ''"gouvernement du peuple, par le peuple et pour le peuple"'' ("government of the people, by the people, and for the people,") a literal translation of Lincoln's words.<ref>{{cite web|title=Constitution du 4 octobre 1958|url=http://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr/conseil-constitutionnel/root/bank_mm/anglais/constiution_anglais_oct2009.pdf|accessdate=2009-10-18}}</ref>

The address has become a part of patriotic American tradition, e.g. a staple for memorization in schools,<ref>{{cite web|publisher= howstuffworks.com|title=How the Gettysburg Address Worked|url= http://history.howstuffworks.com/gettysburg-address.htm|accessdate=2009-11-19}}</ref> and extolled by many writers and poets.

The aircraft carrier {{USS|Abraham Lincoln|CVN-72}} has as its ship's motto the phrase "shall not perish."
