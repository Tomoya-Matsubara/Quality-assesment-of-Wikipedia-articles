'''''Red Headed Stranger''''' is a [[1975 in music|1975]] album by American [[outlaw country]] singer [[Willie Nelson]]. After the wide success of his recordings with [[Atlantic records]], Nelson signed a contract with [[Columbia Records]], a label that gave him total creative control over his works. The concept for the album was inspired by the ''Tale of the Red Headed Stranger'', a song that Nelson used to play as a disk jockey on his program in [[Fort Worth, Texas]]. After signing with Columbia he decided to record the song, and arranged the details during his return to [[Austin, Texas]], from a trip to Colorado. It was recorded at low cost in a studio in [[Garland, Texas]]. The songs featured sparse arrangements, largely limited to Nelson's guitar, piano and drums. Nelson presented the finished material to Columbia executives, who were dubious about releasing an album that they at first thought was a [[Demo (music)|demo]]. However, Nelson had creative control, so no further production was added.

A [[concept album]], ''Red Headed Stranger'' is about a fugitive on the run from the law after killing his wife and her lover. The content consists of songs with brief poetic lyrics and arrangements of older material such as [[Fred Rose (musician)|Fred Rose]]'s "[[Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain]]", [[L. Wolfe Gilbert|Wolfe Gilbert]]'s "[[Down Yonder]]" and [[Juventino Rosas]]' "[[Sobre las Olas|O'er the Waves]]".  Despite Columbia's doubts and the limited instrumentation, ''Red Headed Stranger'' was a [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]] among country music and mainstream audiences. It was certified multi-[[Music recording sales certification|platinum]], and made Nelson one of the most recognized artists in country music. The title of the album would become a lasting nickname for Nelson. It was ranked #184 on ''[[Rolling Stone]]''{{'}}s list of the [[500 Greatest Albums of All Time]], and number one on [[CMT]]'s ''40 Greatest Albums in Country Music''. In 2010 it was inducted to the [[National Recording Registry]].

==Background and Recording==
In 1973 Nelson signed a contract for US$25,000 per year with [[Atlantic Records]], the first country artist signed by the label.<ref>{{cite book|last=Reid|first=Jan|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=qCDF5fFuBT8C&pg=PA223&dq=willie+nelson+chet+atkins&hl=en&ei=5XVQTenJEoq6tgf6o_i2AQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=8&ved=0CEYQ6AEwBzgK#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=The improbable rise of redneck rock: new edition|year=2004|publisher=University of Texas Press|isbn=9780292701977|accessdate =February 7, 2011}}</ref> His first album with Atlantic was the critically acclaimed ''[[Shotgun Willie]]'',<ref>{{cite book|last=Tichi|first=Cecelia|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=p_gYzRsNNbEC&lpg=PA341&dq=shotgun%20willie&pg=PA341#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Reading country music: steel guitars, opry stars, and honky-tonk bars|year=1998|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=978-0822321682|accessdate=February 7, 2011}}</ref> which was followed by ''[[Phases and Stages]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/shotgun-willie-phases-and-stages-r184407|title=Shotgun Willie/Phases and tStages|work=Allmusic|publisher=Rovi Corporation|accessdate=February 20, 2011}}</ref> Due to the success of these recordings, Nelson signed with [[Columbia Records]], and was given complete creative control.<ref>{{cite book|title=[http://books.google.com/books?id=MYMQl9dsKJEC&lpg=PA247&dq=red%20headed%20stranger%20willie%20nelson%20columbia&pg=PA247#v=onepage&q&f=false The first generation of country music stars: biographies of 50 artists born before 1940]|first=David|last=Dicaire|publisher=McFarland|year=2007|isbn=9780786430215|accessdate=March 19, 2011}}</ref>

The album is based on the song "Red Headed Stranger". Nelson often received requests to play the song when he was a DJ in [[Fort Worth, Texas]], where he hosted a show for children. Nelson was inspired to write a complete story that included details of events prior to the ones described in ''Red Headed Stranger''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalinterviews.com/digitalinterviews/views/nelsonw.shtml|title=Digital Interviews: Willie Nelson|work=Digital News|publisher=Rossgita Communications|year=2003|accessdate=March 19, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thebiographychannel.co.uk/biographies/willie-nelson.html|title=Willie Nelson Biography |work=Biography Channel|publisher=A&E Entertainment|accessdate=April 19, 2011}}</ref> Nelson wrote the songs during his return to [[Austin, Texas]], after a ski trip in Colorado.

The story begins with "Time of the Preacher", where the character evokes his love for his wife, whom he suspects is unfaithful. In the following song, "I Couldn't Believe It Was True", the infidelity is revealed. This leads to a short version of "Time of the Preacher," wherein the singer ends with the line "Now the lesson is over, and the killing's begun". The reaction of the husband is depicted by Nelson in a medley of "Blue Rock, Montana" and "Red Headed Stranger". The first song describes the double murder of the unfaithful woman and her lover by the Stranger, who states "And they died with a smile on their faces." This leads to the second song of the medley, which describes the grief of the Stranger.<ref name=Fillingim/> This section is followed by Nelson's cover of the 1947 [[Fred Rose (musician)|Fred Rose]], song "[[Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain]]", were the fugitive laments the loss of his wife. In "Red Headed Stranger," the protagonist commits a subsequent murder<U+2014>he kills a woman he believes is stealing his horse. The horse, to which he undoubtedly holds a sentimental attachment, had belonged to the Stranger's wife.<ref>{{cite book|title=[http://books.google.com/books?id=p_gYzRsNNbEC&lpg=PA344&dq=Red%20headed%20stranger&pg=PA344#v=onepage&q&f=false Reading country music: steel guitars, opry stars, and honky-tonk bars]|first=Cecilia|last=Tichi|publisher=Duke University Press|year=1998|isbn=9780822321682|accessdate=April 25, 2011}}</ref>

The story continues with the Stranger traveling south. In the song "Denver," the character falls in love with a woman he meets in a bar in town. One of the lines from "Blue Rock Montana" is repeated, with a variation: "And they danced with a smile on their faces". The following song, "Can I Sleep in Your Arms?", shows the desire of the Stranger for redemption and love. Next is "Remember Me", where he announces that his vows to his deceased wife are broken and he is free to love. The story ends with "Hands on the Wheel", which depicts the Stranger as an old man who is accompanied by a child, allegedly his grandson, and his new love. The song marks the end of the sorrow of the Stranger, and his redemption years later. The album ends with the instrumental song "Bandera".<ref name=Fillingim>{{cite book|title=[http://books.google.com/books?id=iOoESXFL8usC&lpg=PP1&dq=red%20headed%20stranger%20willie%20nelson%20murder&pg=PA84#v=onepage&q&f=false Redneck liberation: country music as theology]|first=David|last=Fillingim|publisher=Mercer University Press|year=2003|isbn=9780865548961|accessdate=March 19, 2011}}</ref>

''[[Rolling Stone]]'' writer [[Paul Nelson (critic)|Paul Nelson]] wrote: "Red Headed Stranger is extraordinarily ambitious, cool, tightly controlled. A phonographic Western movie which brilliantly evokes the mythopoeic imagery of McCabe and Mrs. Miller, Shane and the works of John Ford[...] The narrative may not sound especially promising or unusual<U+2014>like most fables, it is, after all, the same old story: that is its point<U+2014>but in Nelson's hands, its hard-won simplicity calls forth the same complex and profound metaphysical responses as those brought about by the matter-of-fact awesomeness of the Rocky Mountains. Hemingway, who perfected an art of sharp outlines and clipped phrases, used to say that the full power of his composition was accessible only between the lines; and Nelson, on this LP, ties precise, evocative lyrics to not quite remembered, never really forgotten folk melodies to create a similar effect, haunting yet utterly unsentimental. That he did not write much of the material makes his accomplishment no less singular."<ref name="RollingStone">{{cite news|first=Paul|last=Nelson|title=Red Headed Stranger by Willie Nelson|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/red-headed-stranger-19750828|work=Rolling Stone|publisher=Wenner Media LLC|date=August 28, 1975|accessdate=April 19, 2011}}</ref> Meanwhile, critic Robert Christgau wrote, "Some of the individual pieces are quite nice, but the gestalt is the concept album at its most counterproductive<U+2014>the lyrics render the nostalgic instrumental parts unnecessarily ironic and lose additional charm in narrative context."<ref name="Christgau">{{cite web|url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/get_artist.php?id=1679&name=Willie+Nelson|title=Red Headed Stranger|first=Robert |last=Christgau |authorlink=Robert Christgau |year=1981|accessdate=June 7, 2011}}</ref>

Music critic Chet Flippo wrote in a ''[[Texas Monthly]]'' article entitled "Mathew, Mark, Luke and Willie: Willie Nelson's latest album is more than a good country music; it's almost Gospel": "The difference between Nelson's Red Headed Stranger and any current C&W album, and especially what passes for a soundtrack for Nashville, is astounding. What Nelson has done is simply unclassifiable; it is the only record I have heard that strikes me as otherworldly. Red Headed Stranger conjures up such strange emotions and works on so many levels that listening to it becomes totally obsessing".<ref name="Texas Monthly">{{cite journal|title=Mathew, Mark, Luke and Willie|work=Texas Monthly|first=Chet|last=Flippo|publisher=Emmis Communications|issn=0148-7736|volume=3|issue=9|year=September 1975|accessdate=April 25, 2011|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=VCwEAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA30&ots=g748Bi8mHP&dq=Chet%20flippo%20%22red%20headed%20stranger%22&pg=PA30#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref>

===Movie===
{{main|Red Headed Stranger (film)}}
At an appearance at the [[Armadillo World Headquarters]], a music venue in [[Austin, Texas]], Nelson met publisher and screenwriter [[William D. Wittliff]]. Because of  the success of the album, Wittliff decided to write a script for Nelson based on the story of the Red Headed Stranger. In 1979 Wittliff finished a draft of the project, which was turned over to [[Universal Studios]]. The studio budgeted the film at $14 million and sent the script to [[Robert Redford]], who turned it down. The movie project was tabled, and Wittliff and Nelson had to buy the script back from Universal. The script then went to [[HBO]], who assigned the project a budget of $5 million, but this project was not completed either. Finally, Nelson and Wittliff decided to finance the film themselves. Nelson portrayed the role of the stranger, and the movie was released in 1986.<ref>{{cite book|first=Alison|last=Macor|title=[http://books.google.com/books?id=eBQ_FGDKiSkC&lpg=PP1&dq=Chainsaws%2C%20Slackers%2C%20and%20Spy%20Kids%2030%20Years%20of%20Filmmaking%20in%20Austin%2C%20Texas&pg=PA76#v=onepage&q&f=false Chainsaws, Slackers, and Spy Kids 30 Years of Filmmaking in Austin, Texas]|publisher=University of Texas Press|year=2010|isbn=9780292722439}}</ref>
