'''German submarine ''U-238''''' was a [[German Type VII submarine#Type VIIC|Type VIIC]] [[U-boat]] of the [[Nazi Germany|German]] ''[[Kriegsmarine]]''  built for service in the [[Second World War]]. She was laid down on 21 April 1942, by [[Germaniawerft]] of [[Kiel]] as 'werk' 668, launched on 7 January 1943 and commissioned on 20 February, with ''Oberleutnant zur See'' Horst Hepp in command. Hepp commanded her for her entire career, receiving promotion to ''Kapit<U+00E4>nleutnant'' in the process.

''U-238'' was a member of four [[Wolf pack (naval tactic)|wolfpack]]s; she was a successful, if short lived boat, sinking four freighters and damaging another during her operations against Allied convoys in the [[Second Battle of the Atlantic]]. She had the misfortune, however, of serving at the turning point of the war, when Allied countermeasures were taking a heavy toll on the U-boat force. She conducted three war patrols, beginning in September 1943, following her warm-up trials in the [[Baltic Sea]].  

==War Patrols==
''U-238''{{'}}s first patrol was conducted from [[Trondheim]] in [[Norway]] as part of the [[1st U-boat Flotilla]], and entailed the submarine exiting the [[North Sea]] via the [[Denmark Strait]] and operating against Allied shipping in the so-called "air cover gap" in the Central Atlantic, where Allied aircraft had insufficient range to effectively operate against German U-boats. This first patrol was by far the most successful, as on 20 September 1943, the boat attacked a [[Convoys ONS 18/ON 202|large convoy]], sinking one 7,000-ton cargo ship and damaging another. This was followed by three more victims on 23 September, when two Norwegian ships and a British freighter were sunk from the same convoy.

''U-238''{{'}}s second patrol was less successful. Two weeks after leaving [[Brest, France|Brest]], on the French Atlantic coast, she was attacked by a [[TBF Avenger]] [[torpedo bomber]] from the [[escort carrier]] {{USS|Bogue|CVE-9}}, whose rockets killed two crew members and wounded five more, prompting the submarine to return to Brest with severe damage, which put her out of service for a month. It was during this patrol that the submarine captured two British [[Royal Air Force]] personnel whose [[Vickers Wellington]] bomber had been shot down by ''[[U-764]]''.

''U-238'''s third and last patrol began in January 1944, and lasted a fruitless month, until on 9 February, she was caught by convoy escorts of [[List of World War II convoys|
SL-147]] and [[List of World War II convoys|MKS-38]] 270 miles off [[Cape Clear Island|Cape Clear]]. She counter-attacked, unsuccessfully, and was sunk by the [[Black Swan class sloop|sloops]], HMS [[HMS Kite (U87)|''Kite'']], [[HMS Magpie (U82)|''Magpie'']] and  [[HMS Starling (U66)|''Starling'']]. There were no survivors.<ref>Kemp, pp. 167-168.</ref>
