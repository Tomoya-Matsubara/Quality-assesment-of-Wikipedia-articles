'''Charles Desmond "Charlie" Davies''' (born June 25, 1986) is an American [[Association football|soccer]] player who plays as a [[striker (football)|striker]] for French [[Ligue 1]] side [[FC Sochaux-Montb<U+00E9>liard|Sochaux]].

Born in [[Manchester, New Hampshire]], Davies set several soccer records at his high school, the [[Brooks School]], before appearing for the [[Boston College Eagles]] and the [[Westchester Flames]] in college. Davies signed his first professional [[contract]] with Swedish [[Allsvenskan]] club [[Hammarby IF]] in December 2006 before joining Sochaux in July 2009.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11812_5425915,00.html |title=Sochaux strike Davies deal |work=[[Sky Sports]] |date=2009-07-11 |accessdate=2009-07-11}}</ref>

Davies has been [[cap (sport)|cap]]ped sixteen times for the [[United States men's national soccer team]], with four international goals.

On October 13, 2009, Davies was involved in a serious [[car crash]] on the [[George Washington Parkway]] which killed a fellow passenger and left Davies with severe injuries that put him in doubt for playing in the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010 World Cup]].

== Youth and college ==

As a child Davies was encouraged to play soccer and coached by his father Kofi Davies, an immigrant from [[Gambia]]. He attended the [[Brooks School]] in [[North Andover, Massachusetts]] and graduated in 2004. While there he set many Brooks scoring records, scoring twenty-nine and thirty goals in his junior and senior seasons, respectively. In his senior campaign, Davies led Brooks School to a 15&ndash;0 league record and [[New England]] Class-A Championship. Davies also starred in wrestling at Brooks, earning National Prep All-American his senior season. 

After prep school Davies attended [[Boston College]], where he starred for the [[Boston College Eagles|Eagles]] for three seasons. His sophomore season was cut short due a knee injury suffered in the first half of the season opener.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://bceagles.cstv.com/sports/m-soccer/mtt/davies_charlie00.html |title=Player Bio: Charlie Davies |work=Boston College Eagles |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=2009-05-20}}</ref> During his college years he also played with [[Westchester Flames]] of the [[USL Premier Development League]], scoring six goals in nine appearances.<ref name="USL-release">{{Cite press release |title=Westchester Alum Excels in Sweden |url=http://pdl.uslsoccer.com/home/288819.html |date=2008-11-11 |publisher=[[United Soccer Leagues]] |accessdate=2009-05-20}}</ref> He was a finalist for the [[Hermann Trophy]] in 2006, capping his comeback season. He finished his college career with twenty-four goals and ten assists in thirty-seven games, including fifteen goals in sixteen games his final season.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://web1.ncaa.org/stats/StatsSrv/careersearch |title=NCAA Career Statistics |work=[[NCAA]] |accessdate=2008-10-07}}</ref><ref name="seeing-the-best">{{cite news |last=Dutt |first=Sujay |url=http://www.uefa.com/footballeurope/news/kind=2/newsid=764951.html |title=Hammarby seeing the best of Davies |date=2008-10-22 |publication-place=[[Nyon]], [[Switzerland]] |place=[[Stockholm]] |work=[[UEFA]] |accessdate=2008-10-23}}</ref>

== Professional career ==

Rather than finishing his degree at [[Boston College]], Davies decided to turn pro after three years of college. He was a well-established professional prospect, and was expected to be a very high [[MLS SuperDraft|MLS draft]] pick<ref name=pursue-dream>{{cite news |last=Hush |first=Andrew |url=http://www.soccernewengland.com/articles/view_article.php?id=2240 |title=Davies quits BC to pursue professional dream |work=Soccer New England |date=2006-11-21 |accessdate=2009-05-20}}</ref> had he chosen to accept the [[Generation Adidas]] contract that he was offered.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Player Database: Charlie Davies |url=http://yanks-abroad.com/get.php?mode=players&id=128 |work=Yanks-Abroad.com |accessdate=2009-05-20}}</ref> Ultimately, Davies decided to try his luck in [[Europe]] rather than signing with [[Major League Soccer]].

=== Hammarby ===

After an unsuccessful trial at legendary Dutch club [[Ajax Amsterdam|Ajax]],<ref>{{Cite news |title=Davies leaves Ajax without offer |url=http://yanks-abroad.com/get.php?mode=content&id=2519 |work=Yanks-Abroad.com |date=2006-12-13 |accessdate=2009-07-14}}</ref> Davies signed his first professional [[contract]] with Swedish [[Allsvenskan]] club [[Hammarby IF]] in December 2006.<ref name=pursue-dream/> Although he initially was placed in the starting lineup, he had trouble finishing and spent his first year with the club alternating between being a starter and a substitute. On June 24, 2007, Davies netted his first goal in club play, the game-winner for Hammarby, over [[Formuladeildin|Faroese]] club [[K<U+00CD> Klaksv<U+00ED>k|Klaksvik]] in the first round of the [[UEFA Intertoto Cup 2007|2007 Intertoto Cup]], but he was still unable to score in Allsvenskan play. Davies credits both his [[coach (sports)|coach]], [[Tony Gustavsson]], and Uruguayan star and former Hammarby teammate [[Sebasti<U+00E1>n Eguren]] with guiding his work ethic and attitude through his struggles.<ref name="seeing-the-best"/> In the final match of the [[Allsvenskan 2007|2007 season]] Davies broke through and scored a [[hat-trick]] against [[GAIS]]. 

The [[Allsvenskan 2008|2008 season]] was a major breakthrough for Davies. He scored fourteen goals in twenty-seven games, twenty-five of which were starts.<ref name="USL-release"/><ref name="hammerby-player-page">{{cite web |title=Allsvenskan: Charlie Davies |url=http://www.svenskfotboll.se/t3allpl.aspx?p=152184&playerid=5016 |work=Svenskfotboll.se |publisher=[[Swedish Football Association]] |language=[[Swedish language|Swedish]] | accessdate=2008-10-23}}</ref> As a result of his strong performance in 2008 there were many rumors regarding his transfer to a larger club elsewhere in [[Europe]], but ultimately, nothing materialized, and Davies returned to [[Hammarby]]. 

The [[Allsvenskan 2009|2009 season]] began well for Davies, recording four goals in the first nine league games. He also scored two [[extra time]] goals in a [[Svenska Cupen 2009|2009 Swedish Cup]] match against [[<U+00C5>tvidabergs FF|<U+00C5>tvidabergs]], a ninety-ninth minute equalizer and the winning goal just before extra time expired, to propel his club to a 3&ndash;2 victory in the third round of the tournament.

In the ninth league match of the season, however, he was issued a five match suspension after he made an aggressive play and bloodied the mouth of one of his opponents, [[<U+00D6>rebro SK|<U+00D6>rebro]] defender [[Michael Almeb<U+00E4>ck]], with his elbow.<ref>{{Cite news |first=Greg |last=Seltzer |title=S365 Exclusive: HIF Ponder Davies Appeal |url=http://www.soccer365.com/us_news/story_19509143829.php |work=Soccer365.com |date=2009-05-19 |accessdate=2009-05-20}}
</ref> Davies subsequently left Sweden to join up with the U.S. national team, marking his last appearance with Hammarby.

=== Sochaux ===

On July 10, 2009, before returning from his suspension in [[Sweden]], it was announced that Davies would sign with [[Ligue 1]] club [[FC Sochaux-Montb<U+00E9>liard|Sochaux]].<ref>{{cite news |first=Allen |last=Ramsey |url=http://goal.com/en-us/news/1614/americans-abroad/2009/07/10/1375670/davies-sochaux-want-me-to-develop-into-a-big-time-player |title=Davies: Sochaux Want Me To Develop Into A Big Time Player |work=Goal.com |date=2009-07-10 |accessdate=2009-07-10}}</ref> On August 15, in his second game with [[Sochaux]], Davies came on as a second-half substitute and scored twice; [[Sochaux]] ultimately lost the game to [[FC Girondins de Bordeaux|Bordeaux]], 3&ndash;2.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Ligue 1: Chamakh nets as Bordeaux beat Sochaux |url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=667969&sec=europe&cc=5901 |work=[[ESPNsoccernet]] |agency=[[Reuters]] |date=2009-08-15 |accessdate=2009-08-17}}</ref> However, after only six appearances with the club, [[#Automobile accident|Davies was seriously injured]] in a fatal car crash while in the United States.
<ref name="WashPost-accident"/><ref name="soccernet-accident"/>  On April 26th, 2010, Charlie returned to full training with his club.<ref>{{cite news | first= | last= | title=US striker Davies resumes full training | url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/soccer/2010-04-26-3482558287_x.htm | newspaper=USA Today | location= | date=26 April 2010 | agency= }}</ref>

== International ==

=== Youth ===

Davies played ten games, mostly as a substitute, for the [[United States U-20 men's national soccer team]], but did not make the roster for the [[2005 FIFA World Youth Championship]]. He was the last player cut from the Youth Championship roster.<ref name="boston-secret">{{Cite news |first=Frank |last=Dell'Apa |title=No longer a state secret |url=http://www.boston.com/sports/articles/2006/06/03/no_longer_a_state_secret/ |work=[[The Boston Globe]] |date=2006-06-03 |page=1 |accessdate=2009-05-20}}</ref> After failing to make the U-20 roster at the 2005 World Youth Championship he then focused on the [[United States under-23 men's national soccer team|under-23 national team]] as his next target for international play.<ref name="boston-secret"/> He later trained and played with the team, eventually making the [[Football at the 2008 Summer Olympics <U+2013> Men's team squads#United States|roster]] for the [[Football at the 2008 Summer Olympics - Men's tournament|men's tournament]] at the [[2008 Summer Olympics]].<ref>{{Citation |title=Nowak Names Roster for 2008 Olympic Games |url=http://www.ussoccer.com/articles/viewArticle.jsp_7962632.html |date=2008-07-17 |publisher=[[United States Soccer Federation]] |publication-place=[[Chicago]] |accessdate=2009-05-20}}</ref> As a member of the United States men's Olympic team he made only one appearance in the three games the United States team played at the Olympics. He came on as a substitute in the team's last match against [[Nigeria national football team|Nigeria]], where he nearly tied the match when his header rang off the crossbar in the waning moments, which would have sent the team through to the knockout rounds had it gone into the net.<ref>{{Citation |title=Down to 10 Men After Three Minutes, Valiant U.S. Effort Falls Short as 2-1 Loss to Nigeria Knocks Them Out of 2008 Olympics |url=http://www.ussoccer.com/articles/viewArticle.jsp_8945664.html |publisher=United States Soccer Federation |date=2008-08-13 |publication-place=Chicago |place=[[Beijing]] |accessdate=2009-05-20}}</ref><ref name="soccernet-strut">{{Cite news |first=Jeff |last=Carlisle |title=Davies gets his chance to strut his stuff |url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/print?id=611866&type=story&cc=null |work=ESPNsoccernet |date=2009-01-22 |accessdate=2009-05-20}}</ref>

=== Senior ===

He made his debut for the [[United States men's national soccer team|senior national team]] on June 2, 2007, as a substitute in a 4&ndash;1 [[Exhibition game|friendly]] victory over [[China national football team|China]] in [[San Jose, California]]. Later that summer he was a part of the squad that took part in the [[Copa Am<U+00E9>rica 2007]] in [[Venezuela]]. On October 15, 2008, he scored his first national team goal in a 2&ndash;1 loss to [[Trinidad and Tobago national football team|Trinidad and Tobago]] during the [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification - CONCACAF Third Round|third round]] of [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification (CONCACAF)|CONCACAF qualifying]] for the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]].<ref name="soccernet-strut"/><ref>{{Citation |url=http://www.ussoccer.com/articles/viewArticle.jsp_10485761.html |title=Winning Streak Snapped As Young U.S. Men's National Team Falls to [[Trinidad]] & [[Tobago]] in [[Port of Spain]] |date=2008-10-15 |publisher=United States Soccer Federation |publication-place=Chicago |place=[[Port of Spain]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]] |accessdate=2008-10-23}}</ref> He added his second national team goal against [[Egypt national football team|Egypt]] in the final group stage game of the [[2009 Confederations Cup]]. In addition to the goal, Davies paired and communicated well with fellow Olympian Jozy Altidore, offering a constant threat throughout the game. In the following game against Spain, Davies impressed again, using his pace and work rate to pester the at the time FIFA ranked # 1 team's defense and becoming involved in his strike partner Jozy Altidore's opening goal against Spain. On August 12, 2009, Davies scored the opening goal in a 2&ndash;1 loss to [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]] in [[Mexico City]], becoming only the fourth [[United States|American]] to score against [[Mexico]] in the [[Estadio Azteca|Azteca Stadium]].

=== Automobile accident ===

On October 13, 2009, Davies, who was in [[Washington, D.C.]] for a [[World Cup Qualifier]] game between [[Costa Rica national football team|Costa Rica]] and the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]], was a passenger in an [[Sports utility vehicle|SUV]] that went out of control on the [[George Washington Parkway]] and struck a metal railing at about 3:15 a.m., tearing the vehicle in half. The accident shut down the George Washington Parkway until 8:15 a.m. that morning. The accident killed a 22-year old woman who was in the car with Davies, while Davies himself suffered a lacerated [[Urinary bladder|bladder]], fractured right [[tibia]] and [[femur]], a fractured [[elbow]], and [[Facial trauma|facial]] injuries.<ref>{{Cite web |title=U.S. Men's National Team Forward Charlie Davies Out of Surgery and in Serious but Stable Condition |url=http://www.ussoccer.com/News/Mens-National-Team/2009/10/US-Mens-National-Team-Forward-Charlie-Davies-Out-of-Surgery-and-in-Serious-buut-Stable-Condition.aspx |work=[[United States Soccer Federation]] |date=Oct. 13, 2009 |accessdate=December 8, 2009}}</ref><ref name="WashPost-accident">{{Cite news |first=Steven |last=Goff |title=Davies in Serious Accident |url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/soccerinsider/2009/10/davies_in_serious_accident.html?wprss=soccerinsider |work=[[Washington Post]] |date=October 13, 2009 |accessdate=December 8, 2009}}</ref><ref name="soccernet-accident">{{Cite news |title=U.S. striker Davies injured in car accident |url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=685080&sec=us&cc=5901 |work=[[ESPNsoccernet]] |date=October 13, 2009 |accessdate=December 8, 2009}}</ref> In an interview with ESPN's [[Jeremy Schaap]] on December 4, Davies said that he expects to be running by March and will be fit to play at the World Cup.<ref>{{Cite podcast |url=http://search.espn.go.com/charlie-davies/audio/7<!-- Could not find a direct link because the interview is linked by a java script. --> |title=World Cup Preview Show |website=[[ESPN.com]] |host=[[Jeremy Schaap]] |date=December 04, 2009 |accessdate=December 08, 2009}}</ref> On January 25, 2010, [[ESPNsoccernet]] reported Davies is jogging and hopes to return to [[FC Sochaux-Montb<U+00E9>liard|Sochaux]] by April.<ref>{{Cite news |first=Ives |last=Galarcep |title=Davies on remarkable path to recovery |url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/world-cup/story/_/id/4856256/ce/us/davies-remarkable-path-recovery?cc=3888&ver=global |work=ESPNsoccernet |date=February 2, 2010 |accessdate=February 19, 2010}}</ref> Davies returned to France to complete his rehabilitation with his club, Sochaux, on February 17, 2010, with plans to commence full team training within a month.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Davies says he's a month from resuming training |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2010/soccer/02/18/davies.injury.ap/index.html |work=Sports Illustrated |agency=Associated Press |date=February 18, 2010 |accessdate=February 19, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Exclusive video interview with Charlie Davies |url=http://www.fcsochaux.fr/en/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1431&Itemid=106 |publisher=FC Sochaux-Montb<U+00E9>liard |date=18 February 2010  |accessdate=February 19, 2010}}</ref> He resumed light training with the club on March 22.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Davies resumes training after accident |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2010/soccer/03/22/davies.ap/index.html |work=Sports Illustrated |agency=Associated Press |date=March 22, 2010 |accessdate=March 23, 2010}}</ref>
