The '''74th Boat Race''' took place on 1 April 1922.  Held annually, the Boat Race is a [[Rowing (sport)#Side by side|side-by-side rowing]] race between crews from the Universities of [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] along the [[River Thames]].  Cambridge went into the race as reigning champions, having won the [[The Boat Race 1921|previous year's race]], and had the significantly heavier crew.  Four of the Oxford crew and three of the Cambridge crew had previous Boat Race experience.  In this year's race, umpired by former rower [[Frederick I. Pitman]], Cambridge won by four-and-a-half lengths in a time of 19 minutes 27 seconds.  It was Cambridge's fourth consecutive victory, the largest winning margin since 1914 and the fastest winning time since 1911.

==Race==
[[File:University Boat Race Thames map.svg|right|thumb|[[The Championship Course]] along which the Boat Race is contested]]
Cambridge won the [[coin flipping|toss]] and elected to start from the Middlesex station, handing the Surrey side of the river to Cambridge.<ref name=burn71/> In a light wind and with a good tide, umpire Pitman commenced the race at 4:40&nbsp;p.m., which resulted in a false start, with Cambridge being released from their stakeboat too soon.  After the restart, Cambridge were clear by the Mile Post and two lengths ahead of Oxford by the time the crews passed under [[Hammersmith Bridge]].<ref name=drink140>Drinkwater, p. 140</ref>

According to Oxford's [[Bow (rowing)|bow]], George Drinkwater, Cambridge were "rowing well within themselves" and passed the finishing post four and a half lengths ahead in a time of 19 minutes 27 seconds.<ref name=drink140/>  It was their fourth consecutive victory, the largest winning margin since the [[The Boat Race 1914|1914 race]] and the fastest winning time since the [[The Boat Race 1911|1911 race]].  The win took the overall record in the event to 39&ndash;34 in Oxford's favour.<ref name=results/>
