The pilot introduces [[Characters of Moonlight#Mick St. John|Mick St. John]] ([[Alex O'Loughlin]]), a private investigator who was turned into a [[vampire]] over fifty years ago; [[Characters of Moonlight#Beth Turner|Beth Turner]] ([[Sophia Myles]]), St. John's love interest; [[Characters of Moonlight#Josef Kostan|Josef Kostan ]]([[Jason Dohring]]), St. John's mentor and perhaps the closest thing he has to a friend; and [[Characters of Moonlight# Coraline Duvall|Coraline Duvall]] ([[Shannyn Sossamon]]), St. John's ex-wife and sire.

==Plot==
Mick arrives at the crime scene of the murder of a young woman, where Beth Turner is reporting for ''BuzzWire''. Mick watches as Beth tries to take a picture of the body, which is in the middle of a fountain. Beth takes the picture, but cannot help but notice to large puncture wounds on her neck. While thinking of vampire related titles for her story, Beth runs into Mick, who she says looks very familiar, but he insists they do not know each other. At ''BuzzWire'', Beth's editor tells her that she like the vampire angle, with Beth saying it just came to her. 

The next morning, Beth finds the dead woman's car, with a necklace hanging from the rearview mirror. Meanwhile, Mick goes to visit Josef, his vampire friend who is 400&nbsp;years old. Josef seems concerned about the "vampire" murder being bad for their safety. Mick is also revealed to be 90&nbsp;years old. Mick goes to the [[morgue]] to get some blood and information from his friend, Guillermo ([[Jacob Vargas]]). He smells the dead girl found in the fountain, and realizes that a vampire did not kill her. Mick and Beck break into the dead girl<U+2019>s apartment and find another of the necklaces, with a vial of blood is inside. Someone calls Beth, a person named Josh ([[Jordan Belfi]]), and Mick disappears. At the dead girl's funeral, her lecturer [[Professor|Professor Ellis]] ([[Rudolf Martin]]) gives her [[eulogy]]. After the funeral, a blonde girl named Chloe attacks Ellis, slashing his neck. Mick tells Beth that the blood in the vial from the dead girl's apartment is Ellis's. Beth tracks down Chloe who explains about the professor's vampire-worshipping [[cult|blood cult]] and how she got her friend Kelly (the deceased) involved. Mick visits the professor's wife, who tells Mick about her husband<U+2019>s extracurricular activities with nubile college students. 

Beth goes to Ellis's class and gets and invite to his "[[study group]]". The next morning, Mick visits Ellis, who insists that he is a vampire. While investigating, Beth leans that Kelly had accused Chloe of stalking her. Mick finds Josef waiting for him in his apartment. Josef talks to Mick about the media attention being drawn to vampires because of Beth. While working, Chloe is murdered by someone in an ancient mask from Ellis's office. Mick finds Chloe's dead in the diner and runs off to save Beth. Beth has some one on one time with Ellis, who discovers her wire. Beth escapes, but is kidnapped by the [[teaching assistant|professor<U+2019>s assistant]]. Mick arrives and attacks Ellis, but finds that Beth is gone. He tracks down the assistant and Beth, and manages to save her. Before she passes out, Beth sees the assistant stab Mick. Beth wakes up on Mick's couch and remembers that Mick saved her as a child and that he was stabbed by the assistant, but Mick says it<U+2019>s due to her head injury. After a moment of hesitation, Beth hugs Mick, remembering the ordeal she went through.

In [[flashback|flashbacks]] to 22 years ago, we see Mick and his ex-wife Coraline fighting over a [[kidnapped]] girl. Mick stakes Coraline with the leg of a broken chair, lights the place on fire and rescues the girl. Coraline burns to death, and it is revealed that the little girl has grown up to be Beth, and that he's tried to watch over her and keep her safe over the years. He ponders the fact that the last time he held her in his arms, she was a child.

==Continuity==
"No Such Thing as Vampires" established most of the mythology for ''Moonlight''. It is revealed Mick does not bite anyone, and sleeps in a freezer, not a [[coffin]]. For vampires in general, it is shown that daylight is not good, but it does not cause them to burst into flames; [[garlic]], [[holy water]] and [[crucifixes]] are useless; and they cannot turn into a [[Vampire bat|bat]]. A [[stake]] through the heart might be painful, but only cause [[paralysis]], and the best ways to kill vampires are by [[decapitation]] or consumption by fire. Vampires also have heightened senses, allowing them to hear very well, smell the past and glimpse the future.<ref name="moontv"/>

==Production==
Trevor Munson originally conceived the character of "Mick Angel" in 2004 and spent the better part of two and a half years writing a novel around this character. The story was also adapted into a feature film script, and [[Bruce Willis]] was named as a possibility for the lead. The script later fell into the hands of Nina Tassler at [[CBS]], who paired Munson with Ron Koslow, creator of ''[[Beauty and the Beast (TV series)|Beauty and the Beast]]'', to turn his script into a television series.<ref>{{cite news |first=John |last=Folden |title=Interview With The Vampire Creator: Trevor Munson |url=http://moonlight-archive.com/News/files/6160e4f6d90ed63ebe4d41c9733554e8-90.php |publisher=Moonlight Info Archive|date=[[2008-02-09]] |accessdate=2008-02-09}}</ref>
The show was originally titled "''Twilight''", and the pilot, written by Munson and Koslow, was initially commissioned as a presentation lasting from 14 to 20 minutes by [[Warner Bros. Television]] in January 2007.  [[Joel Silver]] and Gerard Bocaccio also came on board to executive produce the project under the former's production banner, [[Silver Pictures]], in the same month.<ref>{{cite news |author=The Futon Critic Staff |title=Development Update: Monday, January 29 |url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news.aspx?id=7279 |publisher=''The Futon Critic'' |date=[[2007-01-29]] |accessdate=2007-09-28}}</ref>  Alex O'Laughlin and [[Shannon Lucio]] were cast in the original pilot, with Rod Holcomb directing the presentation.<ref>{{cite news |author=The Futon Critic Staff |title=Development Update: Thursday, March 8 |url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news.aspx?id=7318 |publisher=''The Futon Critic'' |date=[[2007-03-08]] |accessdate=2007-09-28}}</ref>

The project was renamed "''Moonlight''" when [[CBS]] gave it an early pick-up and a thirteen-episode order on [[May 14]], [[2007]] prior to the 2007 [[upfronts]].<ref>{{cite news |first=Brian Ford |last=Sullivan |title=CBS Picks Up ''Bang'', ''Power'' Plus Four Dramas |url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news.aspx?id=7387 |publisher=''The Futon Critic'' |date=[[2007-05-14]] |accessdate=2007-09-28}}</ref> [[David Greenwalt]], creator of ''[[Miracles (TV series)|Miracles]]'' and co-creator of ''[[Angel (TV series)|Angel]]'', joined the staff in [[May 2007]] as [[showrunner]] and [[executive producer]] alongside Joel Silver.<ref name="DG1">{{cite news |first=Andreeva |last=Nellie |title=Greenwalt Bites into ''Moonlight''|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/television/news/e3ic037e503baf6e57c2233c754efeb30c9 |publisher=''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' |date=[[2007-06-01]] |accessdate=2007-09-28}}</ref> Greenwalt was hired by CBS during the pilot process to restructure the original concept by Ron Koslow and Trevor Munson.

Regarding his casting, Dohring said that Joel Silver "called out of the blue and said, 'There's a role, and I'm making it younger'". When Dohring was reading about his character, Josef Kosten, he saw him as "dark" and "sharp". Dohring said that he had to "go through the process of audition and all of that", but "Joel pushed it all the way through to the end" and he was not sure if he would have gotten the role without him.<ref name="dohringcast"/> In an interview, O'Laughlin addressed the casting changes, saying that "the whole cast [became] a little bit younger". He especially emphasized on the character of Josef, saying that he became "a lot younger". Originally, Josef was to be portrated by Rade <U+0160>erbed<U+017E>ija, who according to O'Laughlin, was "twice [Jason Dohring's] age". He described Rade <U+0160>erbed<U+017E>ija as "a wonderful actor", with whom he had "a great relationship". O'Laughlin believed that the creators and the network decided that the relationship between Mick and Josef was extremely important because they were almost each other's only ally, and it was a concern that he was more a "father figure" to Mick when Josef was much older. He believed that by recasting <U+0160>erbed<U+017E>ija with a much younger actor, there would be "a level of ease in that age difference". O'Laughlin said that in hindsight, "they were right to make that change".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tvguide.com/news/070928-02 |title=Alex O'Loughlin previews the new CBS vampire series ''Moonlight'' |accessdate=2008-06-15 |author=Webb Mitovich, Matt |date=2007-09-28 |publisher=''[[TV Guide]]''}}</ref>

Travis Fickett of [[IGN]] described the pilot as "a bit of a mess, and really neither here nor there". He said that "[while] the show isn't terrible", it was just "a mix of disparate parts that really don't add up to much". He praised the action scenes, saying "once the action gets started, it plays well". Regarding the actors, he said that O'Loughlin "does a decent job", and that Sophia Myles "is perhaps the most promising aspect of the show". He also said that "Jason Dohring is a welcome presence [and that] in his few scenes, [he] manages to create a character that does have a tremendous weariness and cynicism that comes with immortality". He finished his review by giving the episode 5.6 out of 10.<ref name=moonjosef>{{cite web |url=http://au.tv.ign.com/articles/823/823368p1.html |title=''Moonlight'': "Pilot" Advance Review |accessdate=2008-03-21 |first=Travis |last=Fickett|date=2007-09-27 |publisher=[[IGN]]}}</ref> 

Maureen Ryan of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' gave the pilot a negative review. She said that it "is almost in the so bad it's good category", but the "direction is flat-out awful, much of the dialogue is groan-inducing, [and] the acting by some of the guest actors is jaw-droppingly wooden." She said that Alex O<U+2019>Loughlin's is "passable in the lead role", Sophia Myles "is reasonably good", but described Shannyn Sossamon appearance as "preposterously not-scary". She later said that she "[felt] sorry for the actors trapped in this mess, especially Jason Dohring." She said that he makes the show "[crackle] with a bit of wit and has far more energy than it does in the rest of the plodding hour."<ref name="moonlightreshot">{{cite web |url=http://featuresblogs.chicagotribune.com/entertainment_tv/2007/09/moonlight-is-a-.html |title=''Moonlight'' is a Draining Experience |accessdate=2008-03-21 |author=Maureen Ryan |date=2007-09-27 |work=''The Watcher'' |publisher=''[[Chicago Tribune]]''}}</ref>
