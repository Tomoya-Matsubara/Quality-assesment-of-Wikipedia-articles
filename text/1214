The [[Sanskrit]] word ''[[wiktionary:yoga|yoga]]'' has many meanings,<ref>For a list of 38 meanings of the word "yoga" see: Apte, p. 788.</ref> and is derived from the Sanskrit root "yuj", meaning "to control", "to yoke" or "to unite".<ref>For "yoga" as derived from the Sanskrit root "yuj" with meanings of "to control", "to yoke, or "to unite" see: Flood (1996), p. 94.</ref> Translations include "joining", "uniting", "union", "conjunction", and "means".<ref>For meaning 1. joining, uniting, and 2., union, junction, combination see: Apte, p. 788.</ref><ref>For "mode, manner, means", see: Apte, p. 788, definition 5.</ref><ref>For "expedient, means in general", see: Apte, p. 788, definition 13.</ref> It is also possible that the word yoga derives from "yujir samadhau," which means "contemplation" or "absorption."<ref>For "yoga" as derived from the root "yujir samadhau" rather than "yujir yoge", see Maehle p. 141</ref> This translation fits better with the [[dualist]] Raja Yoga because it is through contemplation that discrimination between [[prakrti]] (nature) and [[purusha]] (pure consciousness) occurs. 

Outside India, the term ''yoga'' is typically associated with [[Hatha Yoga]] and its [[asanas]] (postures) or as a [[Yoga as exercise|form of exercise]]. Someone who practices yoga or follows the yoga philosophy to a high level of attainment is called a [[yogi]] or [[yogini]].<ref>American Heritage Dictionary: "Yogi, One who practices yoga." Websters: "Yogi, A follower of the yoga philosophy; an ascetic."</ref>

==History==
{{Main|History of yoga}}{{See also|Hinduism|Asana}}
The Vedic [[Samhitas]] contain references to [[ascetic]]s, while ascetic practices (''[[Tapas (Sanskrit)|tapas]]'') are referenced in the [[Brahmana|{{IAST|Br<U+0101>hma<U+1E47>as}}]] (900 to 500 BCE), early commentaries on the [[Vedas]].<ref name="Flood, p. 94">Flood, p. 94.</ref> Several seals discovered at [[Indus Valley Civilization]] (c. 3300<U+2013>1700 B.C.E.) sites in Pakistan depict figures in positions resembling a common yoga or meditation pose, showing "a form of ritual discipline, suggesting a precursor of yoga", according to archaeologist [[Gregory Possehl]].<ref>Possehl (2003), pp. 144-145</ref> Some type of connection between the Indus Valley seals and later yoga and meditation practices is speculated upon by many scholars, though there is no conclusive evidence.<ref>See:

Techniques for experiencing higher states of consciousness in meditation were developed by the [[shramana|shramanic]] traditions and in the [[Upanishads|Upanishadic]] tradition.<ref>Flood, pp. 94<U+2013>95.</ref>

While there is no clear evidence for meditation in pre-Buddhist early Brahminic texts, Wynne argues that [[Jh<U+0101>na#Element_and_formless_meditation|formless meditation]] originated in the Brahminic tradition, based on strong parallels between Upanishadic cosmological statements and the meditative goals of the two teachers of the Buddha as recorded in the early Buddhist texts.<ref name="Alexander Wynne 2007, page 51">Alexander Wynne, ''The Origin of Buddhist Meditation''. Routledge, 2007, page 51.</ref> He mentions less likely possibilities as well.<ref>Alexander Wynne, ''The Origin of Buddhist Meditation''. Routledge, 2007, page 56.</ref> Having argued that the cosmological statements in the Upanishads also reflect a contemplative tradition, he argues that the [[Nasadiya Sukta]] contains evidence for a contemplative tradition, even as early as the late Rg Vedic period.<ref name="Alexander Wynne 2007, page 51"/>

<!--
According to Gavin Flood, a sentence in the [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]], one of the earliest Upanishads (800-500 BCE), is an early textual reference to meditation.<ref>"...which states that, having become calm and concentrated, one perceives the self (''atman''), within oneself." Flood, pp. 94<U+2013>95.</ref> Other scholars translate the sentence differently.<ref>The following scholars see the text as implying that the "calm" state is the result of knowledge:
* Mariasusai Dhavamony, ''Classical Hinduism''. Editrice Pontificia Universit<U+00E0> Gregoriana, 1982, page 382: [http://books.google.com/books?id=DD0w_IMFA8gC&pg=PA338&dq=upanishad+4.4.23#PPA338,M1].

The Buddhist texts are probably the earliest texts describing meditation techniques.<ref>[[Richard Gombrich]], "Theravada Buddhism: A Social History from Ancient Benares to Modern Colombo." Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1988, page 44.</ref> They describe meditative practices and states which had existed before the Buddha as well as those which were first developed within Buddhism.<ref>Alexander Wynne, ''The Origin of Buddhist Meditation''. Routledge, 2007, page 50.</ref> In Hindu literature, the term "yoga" first occurs in the [[Katha Upanishad]], where it refers to control of the senses and the cessation of mental activity leading to a supreme state.<ref>Flood, p. 95. Scholars do not list the Katha Upanishad among those that can be safely described as pre-Buddhist, see for example Helmuth von Glasenapp, from the 1950 Proceedings of the "Akademie der Wissenschaften und Literatur", [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/vonglasenapp/wheel002.html]. Some have argued that it is post-Buddhist, see for example Arvind Sharma's review of [[Hajime Nakamura]]'s ''A History of Early Vedanta Philosophy'', Philosophy East and West, Vol. 37, No. 3 (Jul., 1987), pp. 325-331. For a comprehensive examination of the uses of the Pali word "yoga" in early Buddhist texts, see Thomas William Rhys Davids, William Stede, "Pali-English dictionary." Reprint by Motilal Banarsidass Publ., 1993, page 558: [http://books.google.com/books?id=xBgIKfTjxNMC&pg=RA1-PA558&dq=yoga+pali+term&lr=#PRA1-PA558,M1]. For the use of the word in the sense of "[[spiritual practice]]" in the [[Dhammapada]], see Gil Fronsdal, "The Dhammapada", Shambhala, 2005, pages 56, 130.</ref> Important textual sources for the evolving concept of Yoga are the middle [[Upanishads]], (ca. 400 BCE), the [[Mahabharata]] including the [[Bhagavad Gita]] (ca. 200 BCE), and the [[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali]] (150 BCE).

====Yoga Sutras of Patanjali====
{{Main|Raja Yoga|Yoga Sutras of Patanjali}}
In [[Indian philosophy]], Yoga is the name of one of the six [[astika|orthodox]] philosophical schools.<ref>For an overview of the six orthodox schools, with detail on the grouping of schools, see: Radhakrishnan and Moore, "Contents", and pp. 453<U+2013>487.</ref><ref>For a brief overview of the Yoga school of philosophy see: Chatterjee and Datta, p. 43.</ref> The Yoga philosophical system is closely allied with the [[Samkhya]] school.<ref>For close connection between Yoga philosophy and Samkhya, see: Chatterjee and Datta, p. 43.</ref> The Yoga school as expounded by the sage [[Patanjali]] accepts the Samkhya psychology and metaphysics, but is more theistic than the Samkhya, as evidenced by the addition of a divine entity to the Samkhya's twenty-five elements of reality.<ref>For Yoga acceptance of Samkhya concepts, but with addition of a category for God, see: Radhakrishnan and Moore, p. 453.</ref><ref>For Yoga as accepting the 25 principles of Samkhya with the addition of God, see: Chatterjee and Datta, p. 43.</ref> The parallels between Yoga and Samkhya were so close that [[Max M<U+00FC>ller]] says that "the two philosophies were in popular parlance distinguished from each other as Samkhya with and Samkhya without a Lord...."<ref>M<U+00FC>ller (1899), Chapter 7, "Yoga Philosophy", p. 104.</ref> The intimate relationship between Samkhya and Yoga is explained by [[Heinrich Zimmer]]:

<blockquote class="toccolours" style="float:none; padding: 10px 15px 10px 15px; display:table;">
These two are regarded in India as twins, the two aspects of a single discipline. {{IAST|S<U+0101><U+1E45>khya}} provides a basic theoretical exposition of human nature, enumerating and defining its elements, analyzing their manner of co-operation in a state of bondage (''[[bandha]]''), and describing their state of disentanglement or separation in release (''[[moksha|{{IAST|mok<U+1E63>a}}]]''), while Yoga treats specifically of the dynamics of the process for the disentanglement, and outlines practical techniques for the gaining of release, or 'isolation-integration' (''kaivalya'').<ref>Zimmer (1951), p. 280.</ref>
</blockquote>

Patanjali is widely regarded as the founder of the formal Yoga philosophy.<ref>For [[Patanjali]] as the founder of the philosophical system called Yoga see: Chatterjee and Datta, p. 42.</ref> Patanjali's yoga is known as [[Raja yoga]], which is a system for control of the mind.<ref>For "raja yoga" as a system for control of the mind and connection to Patanjali's Yoga Sutras as a key work, see: Flood (1996), pp. 96<U+2013>98.</ref> Patanjali defines the word "yoga" in his second sutra,<ref name="yogasutrastext">{{cite web | last = Pata<U+00F1>jali| first = | authorlink = Patanjali| coauthors = | title = Yoga Sutras of Pata<U+00F1>jali| work = | publisher = Studio 34 Yoga Healing Arts | date = 2001-02-01 | url = http://www.studio34yoga.com/yoga.php#reading| format = [[etext]] | doi = | accessdate = 2008-11-24}}</ref> which is the definitional sutra for his entire work:

<blockquote class="toccolours" style="float:none; padding: 10px 15px 10px 15px; display:table;">''{{IAST|'''<U+092F><U+094B><U+0917>: <U+091A><U+093F><U+0924><U+094D><U+0924>-<U+0935><U+0943><U+0924><U+094D><U+0924><U+093F> <U+0928><U+093F><U+0930><U+094B><U+0927>:''' <br> ( yoga<U+015B> citta-v<U+1E5B>tti-nirodha<U+1E25> ) }}''<br>- Yoga Sutras 1.2</blockquote>

This terse definition hinges on the meaning of three Sanskrit terms. [[I. K. Taimni]] translates it as "Yoga is the inhibition (''{{IAST|nirodha<U+1E25>}}'') of the modifications (''{{IAST|v<U+1E5B>tti}}'') of the mind (''{{IAST|citta}}'')".<ref>For text and word-by-word translation as "Yoga is the inhibition of the modifications of the mind" see: Taimni, p. 6.</ref> The use of the word ''{{IAST|nirodha<U+1E25>}}'' in the opening definition of yoga is an example of the important role that Buddhist technical terminology and concepts play in the Yoga Sutra; this role suggests that Patanjali was aware of Buddhist ideas and wove them into his system.<ref>Barbara Stoler Miller, ''Yoga: Discipline of Freedom: the Yoga Sutra Attributed to Patanjali; a Translation of the Text, with Commentary, Introduction, and Glossary of Keywords.'' University of California Press, 1996, page 9.</ref> [[Swami Vivekananda]] translates the sutra as "Yoga is restraining the mind-stuff (Citta) from taking various forms (Vrittis)."<ref>Vivekanada, p. 115.</ref>

[[Image:Shiva Bangalore .jpg|thumb|right|Statue of Lord [[Shiva]] ([[Bangalore]], India) performing Yogic meditation in the [[Lotus position|Padmasana]] posture.]]

Patanjali's writing also became the basis for a system referred to as "Ashtanga Yoga" ("Eight-Limbed Yoga"). This eight-limbed concept derived from the 29<sup>th</sup> Sutra of the 2<sup>nd</sup> book, and is a core characteristic of practically every Raja yoga variation taught today. The Eight Limbs are:
#[[Yamas|Yama]] (The five "abstentions"): non-violence, non-lying, non-covetousness, non-sensuality, and non-possessiveness.
#[[Niyama]] (The five "observances"): purity, contentment, austerity, study, and surrender to [[god]].
#[[Asana]]: Literally means "seat", and in Patanjali's Sutras refers to the seated position used for meditation.
#[[Pranayama]] ("Suspending Breath"): ''Pr<U+0101>na'', breath, "<U+0101>y<U+0101>ma", to restrain or stop. Also interpreted as control of the life force.
#[[Pratyahara]] ("Abstraction"): Withdrawal of the sense organs from external objects.
#[[Dharana]] ("Concentration"): Fixing the attention on a single object.
#[[Dhyana]] ("Meditation"): Intense contemplation of the nature of the object of meditation.
#[[Sam<U+0101>dhi]] ("Liberation"): merging consciousness with the object of meditation.

In the view of this school, the highest attainment does not reveal the experienced diversity of the world to be [[Maya (illusion)|illusion]]. The everyday world is real. Furthermore, the highest attainment is the event of one of many individual [[Atman (Hinduism)|selves]] discovering itself; there is no single universal self shared by all persons.<ref>Stephen H. Phillips, ''Classical Indian Metaphysics: Refutations of Realism and the Emergence of "new Logic".'' Open Court Publishing, 1995., pages 12<U+2013>13.</ref>

====Yoga and Samkhya====
{{Main|Samkhya}}
Patanjali systematized the conceptions of Yoga and set them forth on the background of the metaphysics of Samkhya, which he assumed with slight variations.  In the early works, the Yoga principles appear along with the Samkhya ideas.  Vyasa's commentary on the Yoga Sutras, also called the <U+201C>Samkhyapravacanabhasya<U+201D>, brings out the intimate relation between the two systems.<ref>Radhankrishnan, Indian Philosophy, London, George Allen & Unwin Ltd., 1971 edition, Volume II, p. 342.</ref>

Yoga agrees with the essential metaphysics of Samkhya, but differs from it in that while Samkhya holds that knowlege is the means of liberation, Yoga is a system of active striving, mental discipline, and dutiful action.  Yoga also introduces the conception of God.  Sometimes Patanjali's system is referred to as <U+201C>Seshvara Samkhya<U+201D> in contradistinction to Kapila's <U+201C>Nirivara Samkhya<U+201D>.<ref>Radhankrishnan, Indian Philosophy, London, George Allen & Unwin Ltd., 1971 edition, Volume II, p. 344.</ref>

====Bhagavad Gita====
{{Main|Bhagavad Gita}}
The Bhagavad Gita ('Song of the Lord'), uses the term ''yoga'' extensively in a variety of ways. In addition to an entire chapter (ch. 6) dedicated to traditional yoga practice, including meditation,<ref name="Jacobsen, p. 10">Jacobsen, p. 10.</ref> it introduces three prominent types of yoga:<ref>"...Bhagavad Gita, including a complete chapter (ch. 6) devoted to traditional yoga practice. The Gita also introduces the famous three kinds of yoga, 'knowledge' (jnana), 'action' (karma), and 'love' (bhakti)." Flood, p. 96.</ref>
*[[Karma yoga]]: The yoga of action,
*[[Bhakti yoga]]: The yoga of devotion,
*[[Gnana yoga]]: The yoga of knowledge.

[[Madhusudana Sarasvati]] (b. circa 1490) divided the Gita into three sections, with the first six chapters dealing with Karma yoga, the middle six with Bhakti yoga, and the last six with Jnana (knowledge).<ref>Gambhirananda, p. 16.</ref> Other commentators ascribe a different 'yoga' to each chapter, delineating eighteen different yogas.<ref>Jacobsen, p. 46.</ref>

====Hatha Yoga====
{{Main|Hatha yoga|Hatha Yoga Pradipika}}

Hatha Yoga is a particular system of Yoga described by [[Yogi Swatmarama]], compiler of the [[Hatha Yoga Pradipika]] in 15th century India. Hatha Yoga differs substantially from the [[Raja Yoga]] of Patanjali in that it focuses on ''[[shatkarma]]'', the purification of the physical body as leading to the purification of the mind (''ha''), and ''[[prana]]'', or vital energy (''tha'').<ref>Living Yoga: Creating a Life Practice - Page 42 by Christy Turlington (page 42)</ref><ref>''Guiding Yoga's Light: Yoga Lessons for Yoga Teachers'' - Page 10 by Nancy Gerstein</ref> Compared to the seated asana, or sitting meditation posture, of Patanjali's Raja yoga,<ref>''Mindfulness Yoga: The Awakened Union of Breath Body & Mind'' - Page 6 by Frank Jude Boccio</ref> it marks the development of ''asanas'' (plural) into the full body 'postures' now in popular usage <ref name=Burley>''Hatha Yoga: Its Context, Theory and Practice'' by Mikel Burley (page 16)</ref> and, its many modern variations, is the style that many people associate with the word "Yoga" today.<ref>Feuerstein, Georg. (1996). ''The Shambhala Guide to Yoga''. Boston & London: Shambhala Publications, Inc.</ref>

==Yoga practices in other traditions==
===Buddhism===
{{Main|Buddhism and Hinduism#Meditation}}
[[Image:Kamakura-buddha-1.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Buddha depicted in yogic meditation, [[Kamakura, Kanagawa|Kamakura]], Japan]]
Early [[Buddhism]] incorporated [[Jhana in Theravada|meditative absorption states]].<ref name=Heisig>''Zen Buddhism: A History (India and China)'' by [[Heinrich Dumoulin]], James W. Heisig, Paul F. Knitter (page 22)</ref> The most ancient sustained expression of yogic ideas is found in the early sermons of the Buddha.<ref>Barbara Stoler Miller, ''Yoga: Discipline of Freedom: the Yoga Sutra Attributed to Patanjali; a Translation of the Text, with Commentary, Introduction, and Glossary of Keywords.'' University of California Press, 1996, page 8.</ref> One key innovative teaching of the Buddha was that [[jhana|meditative absorption]] must be combined with liberating cognition.<ref>Alexander Wynne, ''The Origin of Buddhist Meditation''. Routledge, 2007, page 73.</ref> The difference between the Buddha's teaching and the yoga presented in early Brahminic texts is striking. Meditative states alone are not an end, for according to the Buddha, even the highest meditative state is not liberating. Instead of attaining a complete cessation of thought, some sort of mental activity must take place: a liberating cognition, based on the practice of mindful awareness.<ref>Alexander Wynne, ''The Origin of Buddhist Meditation''. Routledge, 2007, page 105.</ref> The Buddha also departed from earlier yogic thought in discarding the early Brahminic notion of liberation at death.<ref>Alexander Wynne, ''The Origin of Buddhist Meditation''. Routledge, 2007, page 96.</ref> Liberation for the Brahminic yogin was thought to be the realization at death of a [[dhyana|nondual meditative state]] anticipated in life. In fact, old Brahminic metaphors for the liberation at death of the yogic adept ("becoming cool", "going out") were given a new meaning by the Buddha; their point of reference became the sage who is liberated in life.<ref>Alexander Wynne, ''The Origin of Buddhist Meditation''. Routledge, 2007, page 109.</ref>

====Indo-Tibetan Buddhism====
Yoga is central to [[Tibetan Buddhism]]. In the [[Nyingma]] tradition, the path of meditation practice is divided into nine ''yanas'', or vehicles, which are said to be increasingly profound.<ref>''The Lion's Roar: An Introduction to Tantra''
by Chogyam Trungpa. Shambhala, 2001 ISBN 1570628955</ref> The last six are described as "yoga yanas": ''Kriya yoga'', ''Upa yoga'', ''Yoga yana'', ''[[Mahayoga|Mah<U+0101> yoga]]'', ''[[Anuyoga|Anu yoga]]'' and the ultimate practice, ''[[Atiyoga|Ati yoga]]''.<ref>''Secret of the Vajra World: The Tantric Buddhism of Tibet'' by Ray, Reginald A. Shambhala: 2002. ISBN 157062917X pg 37-38</ref> The [[Sarma (Tibetan Buddhism)|Sarma]] traditions also include Kriya, Upa (called ''Charya''), and Yoga, with the [[Anuttara yoga]] class substituting for Mahayoga and Atiyoga.<ref>''Secret of the Vajra World: The Tantric Buddhism of Tibet'' by Ray, Reginald A. Shambhala: 2002. ISBN 157062917X pg 57</ref> Other tantra yoga practices include a system of 108 bodily postures practiced with breath and heart rhythm. The Nyingma tradition also practices [[Trul khor|Yantra yoga]] (Tib. ''Trul khor''), a discipline that includes breath work (or pranayama), meditative contemplation and precise dynamic movements to centre the practitioner.<ref>''Yantra Yoga: The Tibetan Yoga of Movement'' by Chogyal Namkhai Norbu. Snow Lion, 2008. ISBN 1559393084</ref> The body postures of Tibetan ancient yogis are depicted on the walls of the Dalai Lama's summer temple of [[Lukhang]]. A semi-popular account of Tibetan Yoga by Chang (1993) refers to [[tummo|ca<U+1E47><U+1E0D>al<U+012B>]] (Tib. ''tummo''), the generation of heat in one's own body, as being "the very foundation of the whole of Tibetan Yoga".<ref>Chang, G.C.C. (1993). ''Tibetan Yoga''. New Jersey: Carol Publishing Group. ISBN 0-8065-1453-1, p.7</ref> Chang also claims that Tibetan Yoga involves reconciliation of apparent polarities, such as [[prana]] and mind, relating this to theoretical implications of [[tantrism]].

===Jainism===
[[File:Parsva Shatrunjay.jpg|thumb|right|100px|Tirthankara [[Parsva]] in Yogic meditation in the [[Kayotsarga]] posture.]]
[[File:Kevalajnana.jpg|thumb|175px| Kevala J<U+00F1><U+0101>na of Mahavira in ''[[Mula bandha|mulabandhasana]]'' posture]]
According to ''[[Tattvarthasutra]]'', 2nd century CE Jain text, ''Yoga'', is the sum total of all the activities of mind, speech and body.<ref name="Tattvarthasutra 2007 p. 102" /> [[Umasvati]] calls yoga the cause of ''asrava'' or [[Karma in Jainism|karmic influx]] <ref name="Tattvarthasutra 6.2">Tattvarthasutra [6.2]</ref> as well as one of the essentials<U+2014>''[[Ratnatraya|samyak caritra]]''<U+2014>in the path to liberation.<ref name="Tattvarthasutra 6.2" /> In his ''Niyamasara'', Acarya [[Kundakunda]], describes ''yoga bhakti''<U+2014>devotion to the path to liberation<U+2014>as the highest form of devotion.<ref>Niyamasara [134-40]</ref> Acarya [[Haribhadra]] and Acarya [[Hemacandra]] mention the five major vows of ascetics and 12 minor vows of laity under yoga. This has led certain [[Indologist]]s like Prof. [[Robert J. Zydenbos]] to call Jainism, essentially, a system of yogic thinking that grew into a full-fledged religion.<ref>Zydenbos, Robert. ''Jainism Today and Its Future''. M<U+00FC>nchen: Manya Verlag, 2006. p.66</ref> Dr. [[Heinrich Zimmer]] contended that the yoga system had pre-Aryan origins that did not accept the authority of the Vedas, and hence had to be reckoned as one of the heterodox doctrines similar to Jainism.<ref>Zimmer, Heinrich in (ed.) ''Joseph Campbell: Philosophies of India''. New York: Princeton University Press, 1969 p.60</ref> Jain iconography depicts Jain [[Tirthankara]]'s meditation in ''[[Padma asana|Padmasana]]'' or ''[[Kayotsarga]]'' yogic poses. Mahavira was said to have achieved ''[[Kevala Jnana]]'' "enlightenment" siting in ''[[Mula bandha|mulabandhasana]]'' ('root-lock') position, which is first mentioned in the [[Acaranga Sutra]] and later in [[Kalpasutra (Jain)|Kalpasutra]] <ref>Chapple, Christopher.(1993) ''Nonviolence to Animals, Earth, and Self in Asian Traditions''. New York: SUNY Press, 1993 p. 7</ref>

The [[Yamas#Five_yamas_of_Pata.C3.B1jali|five yamas]] or the constraints of the [[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali]] bear an uncanny resemblance to the [[Mahavrata|five major vows of Jainism]], indicating a strong influence of Jainism.<ref>Zydenbos (2006) p.66</ref><ref>''A History of Yoga'' by Vivian Worthington (1982) Routledge ISBN 071009258X p. 29</ref> This mutual influence between the Yoga philosophy and Jainism is admitted by the author Vivian Worthington who writes: "Yoga fully acknowledges its debt to Jainism, and Jainism reciprocates by making the practice of yoga part and parcel of life." <ref>Vivian Worthington (1982) p. 35</ref> The Indus valley seals and iconography also provide a reasonable evidence of the existence of a proto-yogic tradition akin to Jainism.<ref>Chapple, Christopher.(1993), p.6</ref> More specifically, scholars and archaeologists have remarked on close similarities in the yogic and meditative postures depicted in the seals with those of various Tirthankaras: the "kayotsarga" posture of [[Rsabha]] and the ''mulabandhasana'' of [[Mahavira]] along with seals depicting meditative figure flaked by upright serpents bearing similarities to iconography of [[Parsva]]. All these are indicative of not only links between Indus Valley Civilisation and Jainism, but also show the contribution of Jainism to various yogic practices.<ref>Chapple, Christopher.(1993), pp.6-9</ref>

=====References in Jain canons and literature=====
Earliest of Jain canonical literature like Acarangasutra and texts like Niyamasara, Tattvarthasutra etc. had many references on yoga as a way of life for laymen and ascetics. The later texts that further elaborated on the Jain concept of yoga are as follows:

* Pujyapada (5th century CE)
**''Ishtopadesh''

*Acarya Haribhadra Suri(8th century CE)
**'' Yogabindu ''
**''Yogadristisamuccaya ''
**''Yogasataka''
**''Yogavimisika''

*Acarya Joindu (8th century CE)
**''Yogasara''

*Acarya Hemacandra (11th century CE)
**''Yogasastra''

*Acarya Amitagati (11th century CE)
**''Yogasaraprabhrta''

===Islam===

The development of [[Sufi]]sm was considerably influenced by Indian yogic practises, where they adapted both physical postures ([[asanas]]) and breath control ([[pranayama]]).<ref>{{cite doi|10.1017/S1356186304004675}}</ref> The ancient Indian yogic text, Amritakunda, ("Pool of Nectar)" was translated into Arabic and Persian as early as the 11th century. Several other yogic texts were appropriated by Sufi tradition but typically the texts juxtapose yoga materials alongside Sufi practices without any real attempt at integration or synthesis. Yoga became known to Indian Sufis gradually over time but engagement with yoga is not found at the historical beginnings of the tradition.<ref>http://www.unc.edu/~cernst/pdf/jras2.pdf</ref>

Malaysia's top [[Islam]]ic body in 2008 passed a [[fatwa]], which is legally non-binding, against [[Muslim]]s practicing yoga, saying it had elements of "[[Hindu]] spiritual teachings" and that its practice was [[Blasphemy in Islam|blasphemy]] and is therefore [[haraam]]. Muslim yoga teachers in Malaysia criticized the decision as "insulting".<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/asiapcf/11/22/malaysia.yoga.banned.ap/index.html Top Islamic body: Yoga is not for Muslims] - [[CNN]]</ref> [[Sisters in Islam]], a women's rights group in Malaysia, also expressed disappointment and said that its members would continue with their yoga classes.<ref>[http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2008/11/23/nation/2625368&sec=nation]</ref> The fatwa states that yoga practiced only as physical exercise is permissible, but prohibits the chanting of religious mantras,<ref>"[http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gkepLWOtoRT7YiTChjyOPSjkVtzAD94MIV500 Malaysia leader: Yoga for Muslims OK without chant]", Associated Press</ref> and states that teachings such as the uniting of a human with God is not consistent with Islamic philosophy.<ref>[http://www.islam.gov.my/portal/lihat.php?jakim=3600]</ref>
In a similar vein, the [[Council of Ulemas]], an Islamic body in Indonesia, passed a [[fatwa]] banning yoga on the grounds that it contains "Hindu elements"<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7850079.stm | work=BBC News | title=Indonesian clerics issue yoga ban | date=2009-01-25 | accessdate=2010-04-06}}</ref> These fatwas have, in turn, been criticized by [[Darul Uloom Deoband]], a [[Deobandi]] Islamic seminary in India.<ref>[http://specials.rediff.com/news/2009/jan/29video-islam-allows-yoga-deoband.htm]</ref>

In May 2009, Turkey's head of the [[Presidency of Religious Affairs|Directorate of Religious Affairs]], [[Ali Bardako<U+011F>lu]], discounted personal development techniques such as yoga as commercial ventures that could lead to extremism. His comments were made in the context of yoga possibly competing with and eroding participation in Islamic practice.<ref>http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/english/domestic/11692086.asp?gid=244</ref>

The only sect of the Islam community that has successfully incorporated yoga into its practice is the [[Jogi Faqir]], whose followers are Muslim converts from the Hindu [[Jogi (castes)|Jogi]]caste.

===Christianity===
{{Main2|A Christian reflection on the New Age|Aspects of Christian meditation}}

The [[Roman Catholic Church]], and some other Christian organizations have expressed concerns and disapproval with respect to some eastern and [[New Age]] practices which include yoga and meditation.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/2722743.stm BBC News Feb 4, 2003 ''Vatican sounds New Age alert'']</ref><ref>''Catholicism in dialogue: conversations across traditions<U+200E>'' by Wayne Teasdale 2004 ISBN 0742531783 Page 74</ref>

In 1989 and 2003, the [[Holy Office|Vatican]] issued two documents: ''[[Aspects of Christian meditation]]'' and ''[[A Christian reflection on the New Age]]'' which were mostly critical of eastern and New Age practices. The 2003 document was published as a 90 page handbook detailing the Vatican's position.<ref>''Handbook of vocational psychology'' by W. Bruce Walsh, Mark Savickas 2005 ISBN 0805845178 page 358</ref> The Vatican warned that concentration on the physical aspects of meditation "can degenerate into a cult of the body" and that equating bodily states with mysticism "could also lead to psychic disturbance and, at times, to moral deviations." Such concerns can be traced to the early days of Christianity, when the church opposed the gnostics' belief that salvation came not through faith but through a mystical inner knowledge.<ref name="nytimes_vatican">{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE1D61531F934A35752C0A966958260&sec=&spon=|title=Trying to Reconcile the Ways of the Vatican and the East |last=Steinfels|first=Peter|date=1990-01-07|work=New York Times|accessdate=2008-12-05}}</ref> 

The letter also says, "one can see if and how [prayer] might be enriched by meditation methods developed in other religions and cultures"<ref name="Letter_from_Vatican">[http://www.ewtn.com/library/curia/cdfmed.htm 1989 Letter from Vatican to Bishops on Some Aspects of Christian Meditation]</ref> but maintains the idea that "there must be some fit between the nature of [other approaches to] prayer and Christian beliefs about ultimate reality."<ref name="nytimes_vatican"/>  The Rev. John Wijngaards points out the long Judaic and Christian histories of absorbing elements from surrounding religions. He notes that the absence of any intense experience of God's power has sent some Christians eastward. Many Roman Catholics now bring elements of Yoga, Buddhism, and Hinduism into their spiritual practices.<ref name="nytimes_vatican"/>

Some [[Fundamental Christianity|fundamentalist]] Christian organizations consider yoga practice to be incoherent to their religious background and therefore a non-Christian religious practice. It is also considered a part of the [[New Age movement]] and therefore inconsistent with Christianity.<ref>Dr Ankerberg, John & Dr Weldon, John, ''Encyclopedia of New Age Beliefs'', Harvest House Publishers, 1996</ref>

===Tantra===
{{Main|Tantra}}
Tantrism is a practice that is supposed to alter the relation of its practitioners to the ordinary social, religious, and logical reality in which they live. Through [[tantra|Tantric]] practice, an individual perceives reality as [[maya (illusion)|maya]], illusion, and the individual achieves liberation from it.<ref name=UCP>Title: Mesocosm: Hinduism and the Organization of a Traditional Newar City in Nepal. Author: Robert I. Levy. Published: University of California Press, 1991. pp 313</ref> This particular path to salvation among the several offered by [[Hinduism]], links Tantrism to those practices of [[Indian religions]], such as yoga, meditation, and social [[Sannyasa|renunciation]], which are based on temporary or permanent withdrawal from social relationships and modes.<ref name=UCP/>

As [[Robert Svoboda]] attempts to summarize the three major paths of the Vedic knowledge, he exclaims:

{{quote|Because every embodied individual is composed of a body, a mind and a spirit, the ancient Rishis of India who developed the Science of Life organized their wisdom into three bodies of knowledge: Ayurveda, which deals mainly with the physical body; Yoga, which deals mainly with spirit; and Tantra, which is mainly concerned with the mind. The philosophy of all three is identical; their manifestations differ because of their differing emphases. Ayurveda is most concerned with the physical basis of life, concentrating on its harmony of mind and spirit. Yoga controls body and mind to enable them to harmonize with spirit, and Tantra seeks to use the mind to balance the demands of body and spirit.<ref>Your ayurvedic constitution: Prakruti by [[Robert Svoboda]] [[Motilal Banarsidass]] Publication,2005; ISBN 8120818407, 9788120818408 [http://books.google.com/books?id=gRrZvsVTSqEC Google Books]</ref>}}

During tantric practices and studies, the student is instructed further in meditation technique, particularly [[Chakra|chakra meditation]]. This is often in a limited form in comparison with the way this kind of meditation is known and used by Tantric practitioners and yogis elsewhere, but is more elaborate than the initiate's previous meditation. It is considered to be a kind of [[Kundalini Yoga]] for the purpose of moving the Goddess into the chakra located in the "heart", for meditation and worship.<ref>Title: Mesocosm: Hinduism and the Organization of a Traditional Newar City in Nepal. Author: Robert I. Levy. Published: University of California Press, 1991. pp 317</ref>

==Goal of yoga==
The goals of yoga are varied and range from improving health to achieving ''[[Moksha]]''.<ref name="Jacobsen, p. 10"/> Within Jainism and the [[Monism|monist]] schools of [[Advaita Vedanta]] and [[Shaivism]], the goal of yoga takes the form of Moksha, which is liberation from all worldly suffering and the cycle of birth and death ([[Samsara]]), at which point there is a realisation of identity with the Supreme [[Brahman]]. In the Mahabharata, the goal of yoga is variously described as entering the world of [[Brahma]], as [[Brahman]], or as perceiving the Brahman or [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]] that pervades all things.<ref>Jacobsen, p. 9.</ref> For the [[bhakti]] schools of [[Vaishnavism]], ''bhakti'' or service to ''[[Svayam bhagavan]]'' itself may be the ultimate goal of the yoga process, where the goal is to enjoy an eternal relationship with [[Vishnu]].<ref>[http://concise.britannica.com/ebc/article-9381693/Vaishnavism "Vaishnavism"] ''Britannica Concise'' "Characterized by an emphasis on bhakti, its goal is to escape from the cycle of birth and death in order to enjoy the presence of Vishnu."</ref>
