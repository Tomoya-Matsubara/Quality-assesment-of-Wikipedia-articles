'''Pierre-Fran<U+00E7>ois Chabaneau''' was a [[France|French]] chemist who spent much of his life working in Spain. He was one of the first chemists to succeed in producing [[malleable]] [[platinum]]. Chabaneau was born in [[Dordogne]], [[France]], in 1754, and died near his home village in 1842 at the age of 88 years.

==Early life==
Chabaneau was born in 1754 in [[Nontron]], a village in the [[Dordogne]] department of [[France]]. His uncle, a member of the [[Order of Saint Anthony (Bavaria)|order of Saint Anthony]], encouraged him to study theology. While Chabaneau excelled in his studies, his distaste for [[Metaphysics|metaphysical speculation]] led him to antagonize his teachers, which in turn caused him to be expelled from school.<ref name="weeks">{{cite book| title = Discovery of the Elements | pages = 385&ndash;407 | author = Weeks, M.

Sympathetic towards Chabaneau's state of poverty, the director of a [[Jesuit]] college in [[Passy]] offered him a position as a mathematics professor, despite Chabaneau having only a basic understanding of arithmetic. In studying the material for the next day's lessons, Chabaneau taught himself algebra and geometry. His academic interest soon spread to physics, [[natural history]], and chemistry.<ref name="weeks"/> At the age of twenty, Chabaneau was convinced to join the newly-established ''Real Seminario Patriotico'' at [[Bergara|Vergara]] to teach French and physics by brothers [[Fausto Elhuyar|Fausto]] and [[Juan Jos<U+00E9> Elhuyar]]. The two brothers, who later made a name for themselves by isolating metallic [[tungsten]], were the sons of the Count of Pe<U+00F1>aflorida, who had sent them to France to find professors for the Vergara Seminary.<ref name="chaston">{{cite journal | title = The Powder Metallurgy of Platinum | author = Chaston, J.

==Platinum research==
After the Elhuyar brothers isolated metallic tungsten in 1783, Chabaneau collaborated with them in researching [[platinum]]. This did not last long, though, as the brothers had been appointed Directors General of Mining, and soon left Spain for South America.<ref name="chaston"/> [[Charles III of Spain|King Charles III]] created a public chair of mineralogy, physics and chemistry for Chabaneau in Madrid and provided him with a laboratory for his research. The Count d'Aranda secured the government's entire supply of platinum for Chabaneau's laboratory.<ref name="weeks"/>

Chabaneau was able to easily remove most of platinum's natural impurities, including gold, [[mercury (element)|mercury]], lead, copper, and iron, leading him to believe that he was working with pure platinum. However, the metal displayed inconsistent characteristics. At times it was [[malleable]], yet at times it was highly [[brittle]]. Sometimes it was entirely incombustible, yet sometimes it burned readily. These inconsistencies were a result of various impurities: rhodium, palladium, osmium, iridium, and ruthenium. These elements would later come to be known as the [[platinum group]] metals, but at the time of Chabaneau's research, they had not yet been discovered.<ref name="weeks"/> 

So frustrated was Chabaneau by his research that, in 1786, he lost his temper and smashed all of his equipment, exclaiming, "Away with it all! I'll smash the whole business; you shall never again get me to touch the damned metal!"<ref name="chaston"/> Nevertheless, three months later Chabaneau presented the Count d'Aranda with a 10&nbsp;cm cube of pure malleable platinum. His process, involving powder metallurgy and intense heating, was kept secret until 1914.<ref name="chaston"/>

==Platinum age and death==
Chabaneau realized that the sheer difficulty of working with platinum would lend value to objects made from it.<ref name="weeks"/> He and Don Joaqu<U+00ED>n Cabezas carried on a lucrative business producing platinum ingots and utensils. This marked the beginning of what is now known as the "platinum age in Spain,"<ref name="weeks"/> during which nearly 18,000&nbsp;[[troy ounce]]s of malleable platinum were produced in a span of 22 years. The platinum age ended in 1808 when Chabaneau's laboratory was destroyed during [[Napoleonic Wars|Napoleon's second invasion]].<ref name="chaston"/>

In 1799, Chabaneau returned to France seeking rest near his native village of Nontron. There he remained until January 1842, when he died at the age of 88 years.<ref name="chaston"/>
