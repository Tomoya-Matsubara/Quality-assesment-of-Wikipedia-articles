The 139th [[The Boat Race|Boat Race]] took place on 27 March 1993. Held annually, the Boat Race is a [[Rowing (sport)#Side by side|side-by-side rowing]] race between crews from the Universities of [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] along the [[River Thames]].  Cambridge, using "[[Oar (sport rowing)|cleaver blades]]" for the first time in the history of the race, won by three-and-a-half lengths in a victory that was described in ''[[The Times]]'' as "crushingly conclusive".  The winning time of 17 minutes exactly was the fourth fastest time in the event.  In winning the event, Cambridge prevented Oxford making it seventeen wins from the last eighteen races and levelling the overall score for the first time since the [[The Boat Race 1929|1929 race]].

Oxford's crew featured two Olympic gold medallists and saw changes in their rowers and cox in the lead-up to the event. The race was umpired by the former Oxford [[Blue (university sport)|Blue]] [[Mark Evans (rower)|Mark Evans]] who controversially instigated changes to the start procedure of the race.

In the reserve race, Cambridge's [[Goldie (Cambridge University Boat Club)|Goldie]] defeated Oxford's Isis, while Cambridge won the [[Women's Boat Race]].

==Background==
[[The Boat Race]] is a [[Rowing (sport)#Side by side|side-by-side rowing]] competition between the [[University of Oxford]] (sometimes referred to as the "Dark Blues")<ref name=blues>{{Cite web | url = http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2003/apr/06/theobserver | work = [[The Observer]] | title = Dark Blues aim to punch above their weight | date = 6 April 2003 | accessdate = 9 July 2014 }}</ref> and the [[University of Cambridge]] (sometimes referred to as the "Light Blues").<ref name=blues/>  First held in 1829 the race takes place on the {{convert|4.2|mi|km|adj=on}} [[The Championship Course|Championship Course]] on the [[River Thames]] in southwest London.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/uk/london/10719622/University-Boat-Race-2014-spectators-guide.html | work = [[The Daily Telegraph]] | accessdate = 9 July 2014 | date = 25 March 2014 |title = University Boat Race 2014: spectators' guide | first = Oliver |last =Smith}}</ref>  The rivalry is a major point of honour between the two universities; it is followed throughout the United Kingdom and broadcast worldwide.<ref name=CBC>{{cite news|title=Former Winnipegger in winning Oxford<U+2013>Cambridge Boat Race crew|date=6 April 2014|publisher=CBC News|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/former-winnipegger-in-winning-oxford-cambridge-boat-race-crew-1.2600176|accessdate=9 July 2014}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url = http://theboatrace.org/men/tv-and-radio | title = TV and radio | publisher = The Boat Race Company Limited | accessdate = 7 July 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006123036/http://theboatrace.org/men/tv-and-radio | archivedate= 6 October 2014}}</ref>  Oxford went into the race as reigning champions, having won the [[The Boat Race 1992|1992 race]] by one-and-a-quarter lengths,<ref name=results>{{Cite web | url = http://theboatrace.org/men/results| publisher =The Boat Race Company Limited | title = Boat Race <U+2013> Results| accessdate = 9 July 2014}}</ref> with Cambridge leading overall with 69 victories to Oxford's 68 (excluding the "dead heat" of 1877).<ref>{{Cite web | url= http://theboatrace.org/men/classic-moments-the-1877-dead-heat | publisher = The Boat Race Company Limited | title = Classic moments <U+2013> the 1877 dead heat | accessdate = 9 July 2014}}</ref>  Oxford had won 16 of the previous 17 races, a run interrupted by Cambridge's seven-length victory in the [[The Boat Race 1986|1986 race]].<ref name=results/>

The first [[Women's Boat Race]] took place in 1927, but did not become an annual fixture until the 1960s.  The race is conducted as part of the [[Henley Boat Races]], but in 2015 is slated to be held on the River Thames.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://theboatrace.org/women/history | title = A brief history of the Women's Boat Race | publisher = The Boat Race Company Limited| accessdate = 9 July 2014}}</ref>  The reserve race, contested between Oxford's Isis boat and Cambridge's Goldie boat has been held since 1965.

[[File:SquareMaconCleaver.jpg |right|thumb|400px|Cambridge used the cleaver blades ''(depicted bottom)'' for the first time in the competition, while Oxford used macon blades ''(middle)''.]]
Cambridge selected [[Oar (sport rowing)#Cleaver|cleaver blades]] for the first time in the history of the race, following the successful use of the oars in the [[Rowing at the 1992 Summer Olympics|1992 Summer Olympics]] in [[1992 Summer Olympics|Barcelona]].  The surface area of the cleaver was approximately 20% larger than the conventional [[Oar (sport rowing)#Macon|macon blades]].<ref>{{Cite news | title = Cambridge seek cutting edge| work = [[The Times]] | date = 23 March 1993 | first = John | last = Goodbody | page = 48 | issue = 64599 }}</ref>  Oxford practised with cleaver blades in some of their outings leading up to the race, and were prepared to use them should the weather conditions be suitable, but on the day itself they opted to remain with the macon blades.<ref name=complete/>

The umpire for the race was the Canadian Olympic gold medallist and former Oxford Blue [[Mark Evans (rower)|Mark Evans]] who had rowed in the [[The Boat Race 1983|1983]] and [[The Boat Race 1984|1984 races]].<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/ev/mark-evans-1.html | title = Mark Evans Bio, Stats, and Results| publisher = [[Sports Reference]] | accessdate = 4 October 2014}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news | work = [[The Times]] | date = 2 April 1983 | page = 17 | issue = 61496 | title = Cambridge need some help from the Tideway | first = Jim | last = Railton}}</ref><ref>{{Cite newspaper | work = [[The Times]] | date = 17 March 1984 | page = 31 | issue = 61784 | title = Oxford look for nine wins in a row | first = Jim | last = Railton}}</ref>  He caused controversy by instigating a new starting method whereby he would hold the crews for up to ten seconds between the conventional "set" and "go" commands.<ref name=ump>{{Cite news | title = Umpire's orders start Boat Race confusion| work = [[The Times]] | date = 26 March 1993 | first2 = John | last2 = Goodbody |first = Mike | last= Rosewell | page = 44 | issue = 64602}}</ref>  Evans had umpired the [[The Boat Race 1991|1991 race]] in which he had also used his own starting method in preference to the traditional [[Amateur Rowing Association]] instructions.<ref name=ump/> In response to any potential delay at the start during which time the boats will be dragged along with the tide, one of the stake-boat men, Bob Hastings, responsible for holding the boats until the "go" command is given stated: "If the boats start to drag I will let go, before I am dragged out of the stake-boat".<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/rowing-crews-concerned-over-starting-delay-oxford-and-cambridge-upset-by-umpires-boat-race-innovation-1500044.html | title = Crews concerned over starting delay: Oxford and Cambridge upset by umpire's Boat Race innovation | first = Hugh | last = Matheson | date = 26 March 1993 | accessdate = 17 August 2014 | work = [[The Independent]]}}</ref>  Both Alan Inns, former coach and advisor to Cambridge, and Steve Royle, Oxford's director of rowing, expressed concerns over Evans' methodology.<ref name=ump/>

==Crews==

The Oxford crew weighed an average of nearly {{convert|2|lb|kg}} more per rower than their opponents.  Oxford's [[Matthew Pinsent]] was the heaviest rower while Cambridge's Sinclair Gore was the youngest, aged 19.<ref name= surprise/> Cambridge's crew featured three returning [[Blue (university sport)|Blues]] in Dirk Bangert, David Gillard and James Behrens, while Oxford saw five former Boat Race rowers return.<ref name=surprise/> Overall, half of the rowers were non-British (six nationalities representing Oxford, three representing Cambridge)<ref name=schul>{{Cite web | url = http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/rowing--boat-race-schullers-late-inclusion-reflects-meritocracy-tradition-is-only-part-of-the-boat-races-appeal-paul-hayward-reports-1499811.html | work = [[The Independent]] | accessdate = 17 August 2014 | title = Schuller's late inclusion reflects meritocracy: Tradition is only part of the Boat Race's appeal. | first = Paul |last = Hayward |date = 25 March 1993}}</ref> and the same number were [[postgraduate]]s.<ref name=tide>{{Cite news | title = Foreign tide floods Boat Race|first = David |last = Miller | work = [[The Times]] | page= 6| date = 27 March 1993 | issue = 64603}}</ref>  The Cambridge boat club president Behrens claimed: "All our boat are at Cambridge on academic merit.

A late change in the Oxford cox saw Samantha Benham replace Gordon Buxton to steer the Dark Blues, becoming the eighth female cox in the history of the race.<ref name=surprise/>  Oxford's Royle noted that Buxton's form had declined in the run-in to the race, while Benham was "handling the pressure a lot better."<ref name=surprise/> Cambridge cox, Martin Haycock, suggested that female coxes were not as accomplished as their male counterparts: "We had one cox who was exceptionally good at giving massages but on the whole&nbsp;... they're not aggressive or tough enough."<ref>{{Cite news| title = The Oxford blue belle | work = [[The Times]] | date = 24 March 1993 | first = Alice | last = Thomson| issue = 64600| page =15}}</ref>  Oxford also saw a change to their crew in the week preceding the race.  Old Etonian undergraduate Ed Haddon (who had rowed for Isis in 1992)<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.oubc.rowing.org.uk/new/TheFoot_Mar05.pdf| format=pdf | title = The Foot March 2005 | publisher = [[Oxford University Boat Club]]| page = 5| accessdate = 30 August 2014}}</ref> was dropped in favour of German Philipp Schuller.<ref name=schul/>  Schuller had arrived at Oxford just two months earlier,<ref name=buoy/> but rejected suggestions that his late inclusion was symptomatic of the recent influx of "professionals" to the race.  Of his selection, he noted: "You can't have one of the most respected races in the world and then limit it to English people between the ages of 19 and 21 ... on the day we went for whoever would make the boat go fastest. It was done entirely on merit."<ref name=schul/>  Schuller's compatriot and opponent Dirk Bangert had struggled with the move to cleavers, finding it difficult to adjust his timing: "I nearly didn't make it. I couldn't get this rhythm until about three weeks ago and was not sure of my place."<ref name=darkclouds/>

Oxford's finishing coach was [[Mike Spracklen]] who had assisted the Dark Blues in five victorious races, while Cambridge had New Zealander [[Harry Mahon]] in charge for the first time,<ref>{{Cite news | title = Coaches set pace on Tideway towpath| first = Mike | last = Rosewell | date = 25 March 1993 | page = 42 | issue = 64601 |work = [[The Times]]}}</ref> assisted by John Wilson (who had helped coach Oxford to a win in the 1991 race),<ref name=buoy>{{Cite web | url = http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/rowing-oxford-buoyed-by-greater-experience-after-six-successive-defeats-cambridge-will-seek-to-stem-the-tide-in-todays-139th-boat-race-1500254.html | work = [[The Independent]] | accessdate = 17 August 2014 | date = 27 March 1993 | first = Hugh | last = Matheson | title = Oxford buoyed by greater experience: After six successive defeats, Cambridge will seek to stem the tide in today's 139th Boat Race}}</ref> and Sean Bowden,<ref name=darkclouds>{{Cite web | url = http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/rowing--the-boat-race-from-dark-clouds-to-light-blue-skies-training-and-tactics-pay-off-as-cambridge-surprise-oxford-in-the-139th-boat-race-to-end-a-run-of-six-defeats-hugh-matheson-reports-1500724.html| title= The Boat Race: From dark clouds to Light Blue skies: Training and tactics pay off as Cambridge surprise Oxford in the 139th Boat Race to end a run of six defeats | first = Hugh | last = Matheson | work = [[The Independent]] | accessdate = 17 August 2014 | date = 29 March 1993}}</ref> who was subsequently credited with "being half of the team which first turned Cambridge round".<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/general/oxbridge-rivals-blending-brain-with-brawn-283587.html | work = [[The Independent]] | accessdate = 17 August 2014 | date = 24 March 2000 | first = Hugh |last = Matheson | title = Oxbridge rivals blending brain with brawn }}</ref>  Oxford's head coach [[Patrick Sweeney (rower)|Patrick Sweeney]] noted: "If [Cambridge] get away, they will be hard to beat.
