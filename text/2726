'''James Walker''' [[Order of the Bath|CB]], [[Order of the Tower and Sword|KTS]] (1764 <U+2013> 13 July 1831) was an officer of the [[Royal Navy]].  He served during the [[American War of Independence]], and the [[French Revolutionary Wars|French Revolutionary]] and [[Napoleonic Wars]], rising to the rank of [[Admiral (Royal Navy)|Rear-Admiral]].

Walker spent his early years in the navy at first in British waters during the invasion scares of 1779, and then in North American waters where he saw action at most of the decisive naval battles of the war, particularly at the [[Battle of the Chesapeake|Chesapeake]], [[Battle of St. Kitts|St. Kitts]] and the [[Battle of the Saintes|Saintes]]. He reached the rank of lieutenant before the end of hostilities and spent the interwar years travelling on the continent. Returning to service with the outbreak of war with the French, he again participated in many of the key naval actions of the period, with his service at the [[Glorious First of June]] securing his promotion to his own commands. His career was almost ended with an accusation of disobeying orders, which led to his dismissal from the navy, but he was reinstated in time to develop a plan to subdue the [[Spithead and Nore mutinies|mutinies at Spithead and the Nore]]. He commanded a ship at the [[Battle of Camperdown]], and another at the [[Battle of Copenhagen]], earning Nelson's praise for his actions.

The early part of the Napoleonic Wars were spent in the Caribbean, where Walker played an important role in the [[Haitian Revolution]], and took the surrender of a French garrison. After time spent escorting convoys, Walker joined the ships covering the [[transfer of the Portuguese Court to Brazil]], and struck up a friendship with the [[John VI of Portugal|Prince Regent]]. His association with royalty continued with his services in transporting the [[William IV of the United Kingdom|Duke of Clarence]], [[Alexander I of Russia|Tsar Alexander I of Russia]] and [[Frederick William III of Prussia|King Frederick William III of Prussia]], and he duly invested as a [[Order of the Bath|Companion of the Order of the Bath]] and a [[Order of the Tower and Sword|Knight of the Order of the Tower and Sword]]. His later years were spent managing a fleet off the American coast during the [[War of 1812]], and after commanding several ships after the end of the wars, retired with the rank of rear-admiral.

==Family and early life==
James Walker was born in 1764, the son of James Walker of Innerdovat, [[Fife]] and his wife, Mary Leslie, the third daughter of [[Alexander Melville, 5th Earl of Leven]].<ref name="ODNB">{{cite book |chapter=Walker, James (1764<U+2013>1831)|chapterurl=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/28489?docPos=2|title=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography |doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/28489|format=subscription required for online access}}</ref><ref name="Tracy358">{{cite book |last=Tracy |title=Who's who in Nelson's Navy |page=358}}</ref> He entered the navy as a [[midshipman]] aboard the 32-gun {{HMS|Southampton|1757|6}} on 18 December 1776, serving under Captain William Garnier.<ref name="Tracy358"/> He went out to [[Jamaica]] in January 1777, but returned to British waters for service in the [[North Sea]] and then the [[English Channel]] with [[Charles Hardy|Sir Charles Hardy's]] fleet during the [[Armada of 1779|invasion crisis in 1779]].<ref name="Tracy358"/> While serving in the Channel in 1780, ''Southampton'' captured an 18-gun French [[privateer]] off [[Isle of Portland|Portland]], with 80 men aboard her. Walker was sent to assist in removing the prisoners, and after doing so remained onboard to help with the baling and pumping, as the privateer was in danger of sinking.<ref name="USJ202">{{cite book |title=The United Service Journal|page=202}}</ref> Despite his efforts the privateer suddenly sank, nearly taking Walker down with her.

William Garnier was succeeded by [[Philip Affleck]] in command of ''Southampton'' in August, and the ship returned to Jamaica. Walker continued to serve on her until June 1781, when he was transferred to the 98-gun {{HMS|Princess Royal|1773|6}}, the [[flagship]] of Rear-Admiral [[Sir Joshua Rowley, 1st Baronet|Joshua Rowley]].{{Ref_label|A|a|none}} Walker was appointed to act as lieutenant on 18 June 1781 and was assigned to [[HMS Neptune (1683)|HMS ''Torbay'']], part of [[Samuel Hood, 1st Viscount Hood|Sir Samuel Hood's]] squadron despatched to North America.<ref name="ODNB"/><ref name="Tracy358"/> Under Hood Walker saw action at the [[Battle of the Chesapeake]] on 5 September 1781, the [[Battle of St. Kitts]] on 26 July 1782, and the [[Battle of the Saintes]] on 12 April 1782.<ref name="ODNB"/><ref name="Tracy358"/> During the Battle of the Saintes ''Torbay'' had ten men killed and 25 wounded.<ref name="Marshall848">{{cite book |last=Marshall |title=Royal Naval Biography |page=848}}</ref>  Walker was then on the verge of being promoted again, due to the intimate friendship between his father and Admiral [[George Brydges Rodney, 1st Baron Rodney|Sir George Rodney]], but before this could be carried out Rodney was superseded by Admiral [[Hugh Pigot (Royal Navy officer)|Hugh Pigot]], and Walker remained at his previous rank.<ref name="ODNB"/> He continued on aboard ''Torbay'', and was present at the [[Action of 18 October 1782]], when ''Torbay'' and {{HMS|London|1766|6}} encountered the French 74-gun [[French ship Scipion (1779)|''Scipion'']].

==Years of peace==
With the end of the American War of Independence in 1783 Walker visited the continent, touring through France, Germany and Italy.<ref name="ABO321">{{cite book |title=The Annual Biography and Obituary|page=321}}</ref> While in [[Vienna]] in 1787, news reached him of political troubles with the Dutch, and he began to journey back to England in hope of a commission. While travelling through the forest near [[Aschaffenburg]], the [[stagecoach|diligence]] he was in was attacked by ten armed men, who fired into the coach and demanded the passengers' money.<ref name="ODNB"/><ref name="USJ202"/> Walker attempted to resist them, but was left unsupported by his fellow passengers, and was knocked down, robbed, and thrown into a ditch.<ref name="ODNB"/><ref name="USJ202"/> The robbers took 800''l'' of money and rode off, believing Walker to be dead. He came to, suffering from a sabre cut to the head, and was carried into Aschaffenburg.<ref name="USJ202"/> There his wounds were treated free of charge by the local surgeons and authorities, and on recovering sufficiently he was brought to [[Frankfurt]]. There the local lodge of [[freemasonry|freemasons]] offered him financial assistance, and on his arrival at [[Mainz]] he was presented to the [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Prince-Bishop]], [[Friedrich Karl Joseph von Erthal]].<ref name="USJ202"/> The Archbishop gave him a letter detailing his adventure in the forest near Aschaffenburg, and commending his bravery.<ref name="USJ202"/> Despite this assistance Walker was unable to reach England until after the Dutch crisis had abated, and so returned to his travels in Germany.<ref name="ODNB"/>

The outbreak of the [[Russo-Turkish War (1787<U+2013>1792)|Russo-Turkish War]] created a new opportunity for Walker, when in 1788 the [[Russian Empire|Russians]] offered him command of a ship. The [[Admiralty]] refused to grant him permission to accept however, and Walker was obliged to turn it down.<ref name="ODNB"/><ref name="ABO321"/> Despite this, Walker returned to service in the Royal Navy in 1789, with an appointment on 11 September to the 24-gun {{HMS|Champion|1779|6}}, based at [[Leith]] under Captain Sampson Edwards.<ref name="Tracy358"/> He transferred to the 32-gun {{HMS|Winchelsea|1764|6}} on 24 January 1790, serving in the English Channel under Captain Richard Fisher. He left her in February 1792 and spent nearly a year at home.<ref name="Tracy358"/><ref name="ABO321"/> He was back on active service from 2 December with an appointment to the 98-gun {{HMS|Boyne|1790|6}}, intended as the flagship of Walker's old commander, now Rear-Admiral Philip Affleck.<ref name="Tracy358"/><ref name="USJ202"/> ''Boyne'' escorted a convoy of ships of the [[East India Company]] to the [[Tropic of Capricorn]], and Walker remained with her until shortly after the outbreak of war with [[Revolutionary France]] On 24 June 1793 he transferred to the 32-gun {{HMS|Niger|1759|6}}, which was then under Captain the Honourable [[Arthur Kaye Legge]], as first-lieutenant.<ref name="Tracy358"/><ref name="USJ202"/>

==French Revolutionary Wars==
===Promotion and temporary commands===
[[Image:Loutherbourg, The Glorious First of June.jpg|right|thumb|alt=Two large ships sail side by side locked in battle as heavy brown seas roll beneath them and clouds of smoke from other vessels in the background drift into frame. In the foregound, dozens of men cling to wreckage in the water or drift in small boats.|''[[Lord Howe's action, or the Glorious First of June]]''<br/>[[Philippe-Jacques de Loutherbourg]], 1795.]]
''Niger'' was attached to the [[Channel Fleet]], and took part of the [[Atlantic campaign of May 1794]] with [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Lord Howe]]. She was one of the repeating ships at the [[Glorious First of June]], though she did not take part in the fighting herself.<ref name="Tracy358"/> Walker's role as signal lieutenant secured him promotion to commander on 6 July 1794.<ref name="Tracy358"/> He went as a volunteer with Legge to {{HMS|Latona|1781|6}}, had a stint as acting commander of {{HMS|Gibraltar|1780|6}} and in April 1795 he was in temporary command of the [[bomb vessel]] {{HMS|Terror|1779|6}}.<ref name="Winfield2">{{cite book |last=Winfield |title=British Warships of the Age of Sail 1793<U+2013>1813|page=363}}</ref><ref name="ABO322">{{cite book |title=The Annual Biography and Obituary|page=322}}</ref> He received an appointment on 15 July 1795 to the temporary command of the 50-gun {{HMS|Trusty|1782|6}}, and was ordered to escort five [[East Indiamen]] to a safe latitude, and then to return to [[Spithead]].<ref name="Tracy358"/><ref name="USJ203">{{cite book |title=The United Service Journal|page=203}}</ref> Having escorted the merchants to the designated point he received news that a fleet of 36 English merchants were assembled at [[Cadiz]], in need of an escort. 

===Dismissal and reinstatement===
Disobeying his orders to return to Spithead, Walker made for Cadiz, gathered the convoy, and escorted them to Britain.<ref name="Tracy358"/> It was a controversial action. The merchants claimed the cargoes were worth <U+00A3>1 million, and would have been at considerable risk from enemy vessels were it not for Walker's escort.<ref name="ODNB"/><ref name="USJ203"/> However the Spanish authorities were greatly incensed, arresting five of ''Trusty''{{'}}s officers while she was at Cadiz on charges of having smuggled the merchant's money out of the port, and demanding Walker be court-martialled. Walker justified himself by pointing to the imminent alliance between France and Spain, but despite the [[Lords of the Admiralty]] being sympathetic to his cause, he was found guilty of disobeying orders, and was dismissed from the navy.<ref name="ODNB"/><ref name="Tracy358"/> <ref name="USJ203"/> The Lords advised him to join the fleet despatched to the West Indies under [[Hugh Cloberry Christian|Sir Hugh Cloberry Christian]], but it was dispersed by gales and the ship Walker was travelling on returned to port.<ref name="USJ203"/> There it was suggested that he wait in Britain, and with the Spanish declaration of war, Walker was reinstated on the navy list in March 1797 by an order in council.<ref name="Tracy358"/><ref name="USJ203"/>

===Mutiny and Camperdown===
Shortly afterwards [[Spithead and Nore mutinies|mutiny broke out]] at Spithead and at the [[Nore]]. Walker proposed an attack on the mutinous ships at the Nore using heavily armed [[gunboat]]s, fitted with [[carronades]], and was commissioned by the Admiralty on 10 June to carry this out.<ref name="Tracy358"/><ref name="Marshall849">{{cite book |last=Marshall |title=Royal Naval Biography |page=849}}</ref> Walker set out down the [[Thames]] but only got as far as [[Gravesend, Kent|Gravesend]] before news reached him that the mutineers had submitted and his operation was no longer necessary.<ref name="ODNB"/><ref name="USJ203"/> He was appointed acting-captain of [[HMS Sibyl (1779)|HMS ''Garland'']] on 16 July 1797 and conveyed a Baltic-bound convoy of merchants as far as [[Elsinore]].<ref name="ABO323">{{cite book |title=The Annual Biography and Obituary|page=323}}</ref> 
[[Image:Thomas-Whitcombe-Battle-of-Camperdown.jpg|left|thumb|''The Battle of Camperdown, 11 October 1797'' by [[Thomas Whitcombe]], painted 1798.]]
On his return he was appointed captain of the 64-gun {{HMS|Monmouth|1796|6}} on 20 August, still in an acting capacity.<ref name="Tracy358"/> ''Monmouth'' had been one of the most mutinous ships of the whole fleet, and was heavily involved in the Nore mutiny.<ref name="USJ203"/> Walker took her to join Admiral [[Adam Duncan, 1st Viscount Duncan|Adam Duncan's]] fleet in the [[North Sea]]. Within a short time he was able to restore good order aboard her, and was able to play a significant role in the [[Battle of Camperdown]] on 11 October.<ref name="USJ203"/> As she approached the Dutch fleet Walker gathered the crew and addressed them saying 'My lads, you see your enemy; I shall lay you close aboard and give you an opportunity of washing the stain off your characters in the blood of your foes. Now, go to your quarters and do your duty.'<ref name="ODNB"/><ref name="Tracy358"/> During the battle ''Monmouth'' engaged the Dutch ships ''Delft'' and ''Alkmaar'' for an hour and a half, forcing both of them to surrender.<ref name="Tracy358"/> ''Monmouth'', which had lost five men killed and 22 wounded, took ''Alkmaar'' in tow, and despite sailing through a strong gale, reached the shelter of Yarmouth roads five days later.<ref name="Marshall850">{{cite book |last=Marshall |title=Royal Naval Biography |page=850}}</ref> The battle was a decisive victory for the British over the Dutch, and Walker was among those captains rewarded, having his post rank confirmed on 17 October, and receiving the [[Naval Gold Medal]] and the thanks of parliament.<ref name="ODNB"/><ref name="Tracy358"/><ref name="Marshall849"/> He attended the service of thanksgiving at [[St Paul's Cathedral]] on 19 December, and assisted in depositing the captured enemy colours.<ref name="ABO323"/>

===Later commands and Copenhagen===
[[Image:PocockBattleOfCopenhagen.jpg|right|thumb|''The Battle of Copenhagen'', by [[Nicholas Pocock]]]]
Walker took command of the 64-gun {{HMS|Veteran|1787|6}} on 8 February 1798, before transferring in quick succession to the 56-gun {{HMS|Brakel|1796|6}}, the 98-gun {{HMS|Prince George|1772|6}}, the 90-gun {{HMS|Prince|1788|6}} and lastly the 50-gun {{HMS|Isis|1774|6}} on 7 October 1800.<ref name="Tracy358"/> He commanded ''Isis'' in the North Sea, the [[Skagerrak]] and in the [[Baltic Sea]], as well as with the Channel Fleet. ''Isis'' was assigned to the Baltic expedition under Admiral [[Hyde Parker (admiral)|Sir Hyde Parker]], and joined Rear-Admiral [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Horatio Nelson's]] squadron for the [[Battle of Copenhagen]] on 2 April 1801.<ref name="ODNB"/> The plan of attack had to be improvised at the last minute, after several ships ran aground while trying to enter the harbour, including Nelson's flagship, {{HMS|Elephant|1786|6}}. Walker took ''Isis'' in to engage both his own target as well as ''Elephant''{{'}}s, and ended up fighting two Danish blockships and a 14-gun battery.<ref name="Tracy359">{{cite book |last=Tracy |title=Who's who in Nelson's Navy |page=359}}</ref> When eventually Nelson was able to work his way down the line he left Walker at his task and took another position. As he passed, Nelson took off his hat, waved it, and cried, 'Well done, brave Walker! Go on as you have begun; nothing can be better'.<ref name="ODNB"/> After four and a half hours of intense fighting ''Isis'' silenced her opponents, at the heavy cost of nine officers and 103 men killed or wounded.<ref name="USJ204">{{cite book |title=The United Service Journal|page=204}}</ref> Nelson came aboard ''Isis'' the following morning and thanked Walker and his men for their brave efforts.<ref name="USJ204"/>

==Peace, and Napoleonic Wars==
===Caribbean and Haiti===
Walker received an appointment to command the new 32-gun {{HMS|Tartar|1801|6}} on 1 July 1801 and took a convoy of merchants to Jamaica.<ref name="ABO323"/> He continued to be employed, despite the drawdown of the navy following the [[Peace of Amiens]], and received command of the 74-gun {{HMS|Vanguard|1787|6}} on 27 January 1802.<ref name="ODNB"/><ref name="Tracy359"/> With the resumption of hostilities in 1803 he was assigned to blockade [[San Domingo]], and captured the 44-gun French frigate [[French frigate Cr<U+00E9>ole|''Cr<U+00E9>ole'']], bound for [[Port au Prince]] with 530 troops under General Morgan.<ref name="Marshall850"/> On 25 July he captured the French 74-gun [[French ship Duquesne (1787)|''Duquesne'']].<ref name="ODNB"/><ref name="Tracy359"/> After taking his prize to Jamaica Walker returned to his station and on 1 October demanded the surrender of the French garrison at [[Saint-Marc]]. The garrison of 1100 men was besieged by the black forces of generals [[Jean-Jacques Dessalines]] and [[Henri Christophe]], and were short of food. They agreed to surrender to Walker and were taken off in order to save from the vengeance of the besieging forces.<ref name="ODNB"/><ref name="Tracy359"/> In doing so he saved their lives, but as his provisions were rapidly exhausted he was forced to return to port to resupply at the point at which Cape Fran<U+00E7>ois was about to fall, and so missed out on a considerable sum of prize money.<ref name="USJ204"/>

===Convoys===
Walker was then given command of his prize, the ''Duquesne'', on 2 March 1804, and sailed her from Jamaica to [[Chatham Dockyard|Chatham]] with only 160 men.<ref name="Tracy359"/> Also embarked on the ''Duquesne'' were an almost equal number of French prisoners, which had to be closely watched during the passage, in case they made an attempt to take the ship.<ref name="ABO324">{{cite book |title=The Annual Biography and Obituary|page=324}}</ref> She arrived in England without incident, and Walker paid her off for repairs.<ref name="Marshall852">{{cite book |last=Marshall |title=Royal Naval Biography |page=852}}</ref> He then received command of the 36-gun [[HMS Unicorn (1782)|HMS ''Thalia'']] on 1 March 1805 and escorted convoys to the East Indies and [[Quebec]].<ref name="ODNB"/><ref name="Tracy359"/> The voyage to the East Indies was made with two ships laden with treasure was made safely and quickly, with Walker arriving back at Spithead ten months to the day of his departure.<ref name="USJ205">{{cite book |title=The United Service Journal|page=205}}</ref> The voyage to Quebec was made in company with two frigates, which delivered the convoy, but were delayed in port by gales until 1 December 1806. After setting sail ''Thalia'' became caught in a gale off the [[Grand Banks of Newfoundland|Newfoundland Banks]] and ran for 1250 miles for five days under bare poles.<ref name="USJ205"/> After returning to Spithead Walker was assigned to the [[Guernsey]] station under Sir Edmund Nagle, where he was given command of a squadron of three frigates and a brig to watch the enemy at [[St Malo]].<ref name="Tracy359"/><ref name="USJ205"/>

===Portuguese service===
[[File:Domingos Sequeira - D. Jo<U+00E3>o VI.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[John VI of Portugal]]. Walker became a confidant during his time in Brazil while John was Prince Regent.]] 
He was transferred to the 74-gun {{HMS|Bedford|1775|6}} in October 1807 and was sent to Lisbon with [[Sidney Smith (Royal Navy officer)|Sir Sidney Smith]].<ref name="Tracy359"/> While there the decision was made to [[Transfer of the Portuguese Court to Brazil|evacuate]] the [[House of Braganza|Portuguese Royal Family]] to [[Brazil]], and HMS ''Bedford'' joined {{HMS|Monarch|1765|6}}, {{HMS|London|1766|6}} and {{HMS|Marlborough|1807|6}} as an escort for the Portuguese ships, with the British squadron being commanded by Commodore [[Graham Moore]].<ref name="USJ205"/> The fleet was dispersed by heavy gales off [[Madeira]], though ''Bedford'' was able to rejoin the ships carrying the royals two days later, and was the only British ship to escort them for the rest of the thirteen week voyage.<ref name="USJ205"/> Walker struck up a friendship with the [[John VI of Portugal|Prince Regent]], who wanted to create him a member of the [[Order of Aviz]], but owing to Walker's religion, he instead recreated the military [[Order of the Tower and Sword]]. The Prince Regent invested himself with the honour, and then immediately created Walker a Knight Commander of the order on 30 April 1816, making him the senior Knight Commander of the order.<ref name="ABO324"/><ref name="USJ205"/> Walker spent two years with the court at [[Rio de Janeiro]], and in addition to the honour, received the Prince Regent's portrait set in [[Brilliant (diamond cut)|brilliants]], a valuable diamond ring, and several letters testifying to Walker's good service.<ref name="ODNB"/><ref name="USJ205"/>  

===Royalty, and the Americas===
On Walker's returned to Britain he asked for, and received orders to join the fleet in the North Sea. He took part in the blockade of [[Flushing, Netherlands|Flushing]] under Admiral John Ferrier, narrowly avoiding being wrecked in a gale on 14 January 1814.<ref name="USJ205"/>  After being repaired she joined Admiral William Young, and then Admiral Scott to go into Flushing.<ref name="USJ205"/> In the summer of 1814 Walker was selected to accompany the [[William IV of the United Kingdom|Duke of Clarence]] on his journey to [[Boulogne]] to collect [[Alexander I of Russia|Tsar Alexander I of Russia]] and [[Frederick William III of Prussia|King Frederick William III of Prussia]].<ref name="Tracy359"/> ''Bedford'' then formed part of the fleet assembled for a Royal review.<ref name="USJ205"/> He then made two trips to bring army units back from the continent. In September 1814 he took command of a squadron carrying the advance guard of an invasion force to occupy [[New Orleans]] under Major-General [[John Keane, 1st Baron Keane|John Keane]]. During the campaign the senior naval officers, [[Alexander Cochrane|Sir Alexander Cochrane]] and Rear-Admirals [[Pulteney Malcolm]] and [[Edward Codrington]], went ashore, leaving Walker to manage the fleet, which owing to the shoal water, had to be kept a hundred miles offshore.<ref name="ODNB"/><ref name="USJ205"/>

==Later years==
Walker continued to receive employment despite the end of the wars with France and America, commanding in turn the 74-gun ships {{HMS|Albion|1802|6}}, {{HMS|Queen|1769|6}} and {{HMS|Northumberland|1798|6}}, paying off ''Northumberland'' on 10 September 1818.<ref name="ODNB"/> He had been nominated a [[Companion of the Bath]] on 4 June 1815, and was promoted to rear-admiral on 19 July 1821.<ref name="ODNB"/><ref name="Tracy359"/> Walker was reportedly a cheerful and friendly officer, who won respect through his leniency and good nature. His commanding officer, William Young, once complimented him for keeping ''Bedford'' in a state of high discipline without once resorting to a flogging over a period of five months and three weeks.<ref name="ODNB"/> While in command of the ''Northumberland'' he was praised for his actions when he and his crew fought a fire that had broken out in [[Sheerness Dockyard]], and which had threatened to destroy the entire yard.<ref name="USJ208">{{cite book |title=The United Service Journal|page=208}}</ref> James Walker was twice married, at first to a daughter of General [[John Irwin (British Army officer)|Sir John Irwin]], [[Commander-in-Chief, Ireland]]. The marriage did not produce any children and after her death Walker married Priscilla Sarah, the fourth daughter of the [[Member of Parliament|MP]] [[Arnoldus Jones-Skelton]].<ref name="Tracy359"/> The couple had three sons, the eldest, Melville, entered the army, the two younger sons, Frederick and Thomas, followed their father into the navy.<ref name="Marshall853">{{cite book |last=Marshall |title=Royal Naval Biography |page=853}}</ref> Rear-Admiral James Walker died at [[East Blatchington|Blatchington]], near [[Seaford, East Sussex|Seaford]], [[Sussex]] on 13 July 1831 at the age of 67, after a short illness.<ref name="ODNB"/><ref name="Tracy359"/>

{{refbegin}}
'''a.''' {{Note_label|A|a|none}} The ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'' instead lists ''Princess Royal'' as the flagship of [[Sir Peter Parker, 1st Baronet|Sir Peter Parker]].<ref name="ODNB"/> Tracey's ''Who's Who in Nelson's Navy'' lists Rowley.<ref name="Tracy358"/> Winfield's ''British Warships of the Age of Sail 1714<U+2013>1792'' records that ''Princess Royal'', under Captain Harry Harmood, had been Rear-Admiral [[Sir Hyde Parker, 5th Baronet|Sir Hyde Parker's]] flagship at the [[Battle of Martinique (1780)|Battle of Martinique]] on 17 April 1780, and subsequently at the Actions of 15 and 19 May 1780 against [[Luc Urbain de Bouexic, comte de Guichen|de Guichen's]] fleet. Harmood had however been replaced later in 1780 by Captain [[John Thomas Duckworth]], and had become Rowley's flagship prior to sailing to Jamaica.
