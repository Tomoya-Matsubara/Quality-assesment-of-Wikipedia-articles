'''Severe Tropical Cyclone Joy''' in late&nbsp;1990 produced the third highest floods on record in [[Rockhampton]], [[Queensland]], a town in northeastern Australia. This cyclone began as a weak [[low pressure area|tropical low]] near the [[Solomon Islands]], and initially moved westward. On 18&nbsp;December, it was named Joy, becoming the 2nd [[tropical cyclone naming|named storm]] of the [[1990<U+2013>91 Australian region cyclone season]].  After turning southwest, Joy developed a well-defined [[eye (cyclone)|eye]] and strengthened to  [[maximum sustained wind]]s of 165&nbsp;km/h (105&nbsp;mph) while approaching [[Cairns]] in [[Far North Queensland]]. Brushing the city with strong winds, the cyclone soon weakened and turned southeast. Joy later curved back southwest, making [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] near [[Townsville]], Queensland on 26&nbsp;December. It dissipated the next day; remnant moisture continued as torrential rainfall over Queensland for two weeks.

While drifting offshore northeastern Australia, the cyclone produced wind gusts as high as 124&nbsp;km/h (77&nbsp;mph) in Cairns, strong enough to cause power outages. In [[Mackay, Queensland|Mackay]], a [[tornado]] spawned by Joy damaged 40&nbsp;homes, while torrential rainfall just south of the city peaked at over {{Convert|2|m|ft|abbr=on}}. Most storm-associated damage was wrought by severe flooding, which persisted for weeks in  hardest-hit locations. Rains significantly increased water levels on 10&nbsp;rivers, among them the [[Fitzroy River (Queensland)|Fitzroy River]], which [[discharge (hydrology)|discharged]] about 18&nbsp;trillion freshwater litres (4.9&nbsp;trillion gallons) into [[Keppel Bay]] over 25&nbsp;days. In turn, the [[Great Barrier Reef]] suffered biological damage from [[coral bleaching]] and decreased [[salinity]]. The Fitzroy River rose to a {{convert|9.30|m|ft|abbr=on}} peak at Rockhampton, forcing thousands to evacuate homes; some stranded individuals could only obtain food by helicopter. Elsewhere in Australia, storm moisture alleviated drought conditions and diminished fires near [[Sydney]]. Overall, Joy killed six people and caused {{AUD}}300&nbsp;million in damage ($234&nbsp;million [[United States dollar|USD]]).{{#tag:ref|All damage totals are listed in 1990 values of their respective currencies.|group="nb"}} Afterwards, the Queensland government issued a disaster declaration for about 30% of the state, and the name Joy was  [[List of retired Australian cyclone names|retired]] from the [[list of historic tropical cyclone names|list of tropical cyclone names]].
