'''Warren Stacey''' (born '''Warren Jituboh''')<ref name="Telegraph">{{Cite news|title=One that got away|first=Tom|last=Horan|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rockandjazzmusic/3574567/One-that-got-away.html|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=14 March 2002|accessdate=12 October 2010}}</ref> is a British [[singer]] from [[London]] who came into prominence on the UK television show ''[[Popstars (UK series 1)|Popstars]]'', the [[reality TV|reality]] programme that created the [[pop music|pop]] band [[Hear'Say]]. Despite not making it into the group, Stacey went on to be signed by [[Def Jam Recordings]] and released his debut single "My Girl My Girl" in March 2002, which made Number 26 on the [[UK Singles Chart]].

==Life and music career==
Stacey's first experience of performing music was singing in a church [[choir]] at a young age.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://designermagazine.tripod.com/WarrenStaceyINT1.html|title=Warren Stacey - Interview @ Designer Magazine|year=2002|publisher=Designer Magazine|accessdate=12 October 2002}}</ref> In 2001, while working at a London branch of [[NatWest]],<ref name="Telegraph"/> he auditioned to become a member of [[Hear'Say]], the pop group that was being formed from the [[reality television]] programme ''[[Popstars (UK series 1)|Popstars]]''. He impressed the show's judges with a rendition of "[[Angels (Robbie Williams song)|Angels]]" by [[Robbie Williams]] and progressed on to the "[[Recruit training|boot camp]]" stage of the competition. During the second day of boot camp, Stacey opted to perform a [[hymn]] rather than a [[pop song]] for the judges. [[Nigel Lythgoe]], one of the show's judges, informed him that the final band was obviously not going to perform hymns and that, at that stage in the competition, the judges were looking for small reasons such as this to eliminate contestants. However, Stacey's part in a group performance of "[[Monday, Monday]]" by [[The Mamas & the Papas]] was seen as sufficient enough to keep him in the competition for another day.
