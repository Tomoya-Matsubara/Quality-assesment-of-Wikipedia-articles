The '''Knights of Equity''' (KOE) is an [[Irish-Catholic]] [[fraternal organization]] established in the U.S. in 1895 and still in active operation in the 21st century. The group is among the oldest Irish-Catholic membership associations in America. With some 65 local chapters, called "courts", during its period of greatest influence, the group was an important [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] political and fraternal benefit society. The early society organized Irish Catholics in America against discrimination, and gave finaincial aid to impoverished Irish immigrants.

==Organizational history==
===Establishment===
The Knights of Equity (KOE) was established in [[Cleveland, Ohio]] in 1895,<ref name=WRHS>Lonnie McCauley, Deborah Shell, and Michael McCormick, [http://ead.ohiolink.edu/xtf-ead/view?docId=ead/OCLWHi0136.xml;chunk.id=bioghist_1;brand=default "History of the Knights of Equity,"] Knights of Equity online finding aid, Western Reserve Historical Society, 2000. [http://barbera.wrhs.org/docs/library/irisharch/knights.pdf PDF version] also available.</ref> making it one of the oldest Irish-Catholic organizations in America.<ref name=Pitt>ULS Archives Service Center, [http://digital.library.pitt.edu/cgi-bin/f/findaid/findaid-idx?type=simple;c=ascead;view=text;subview=outline;didno=US-PPiU-ais197736 "Knights of Equity Court #9 Records: Summary Information,"] Pittsburgh, PA: University of Pittsburgh Library System, 2003.</ref> Although the group's articles of incorporation innocuously stated the group's purpose as the creation of "a spirit of mutual helpfulness among its members; to advance them intellectually and socially; and by co-operation among them, to promote their material interests and well-being,"<ref name=WRHS /> in practice the organization served economic and political functions, lending aid to needy Irish immigrants and organizing to fight bigotry and discrimination against the Irish in America.<ref>''Irish America: Volume 8.'' Irish Voice, 1992; pg. 8.</ref> Of prime importance to the early organization were orphans, the indigent elderly, and financially strapped young men pursuing Catholic priesthood.<ref>Jerrold I. Casway, [http://books.google.com/books?id=-pKGAAAAMAAJ&q=%22+the+elderly,+and+young+men+interested+%22&dq=%22+the+elderly,+and+young+men+interested+%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=9HiWT7TOFMimiQKy_PmvCg&ved=0CDUQ6AEwAA ''Ed Delahanty in the Emerald Age of Baseball.''] Notre Dame, IN: University of Notre Dame Press, 2004; pg. 97.</ref>

Cleveland proved to be a fertile ground for organization, and the Knights of Equity soon had established three local groups, known as "courts", in the city <U+2014> the largest of which had some 5,000 members.<ref name=WRHS /> Other Irish communities throughout the [[Eastern United States|Eastern]] and [[Midwestern United States]] soon followed the Cleveland example, establishing local courts of their own. At the peak of the organization's size and influence during its first decade, the Knights of Equity included some 65 local courts stretching from [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] in the East to [[Sioux City, Iowa]] in the West, and from the [[Canada|Canadian]] border to the Mid-South.<ref name=Why />

In its earliest incarnation, the Knights of Equity was part of the broad Catholic reaction to the [[protestant]] [[chauvinism]] espoused by the [[American Protective Association]] (APA), an anti-Catholic secret society established in 1887. Working together with other Catholic groups, the Knights of Equity managed to isolate and neutralize the APA and its anti-immigrant nationalism by the end of the 19th century.<ref name=Why>[http://www.knightsofequity.com/AboutUs.html "Why? The Knights of Equity,"] www.knightsofequity.com</ref>

===Membership===
Membership in the organization was open to men 21 years or older of Irish birth or extraction, who were practicing members of the Catholic Church, and who resided in a city where the organization had a local court.<ref name=Pitt /> The group functioned as a [[secret society]], making use of esoteric ritual, including a four degree system of [[initiation]].<ref>[http://www.phoenixmasonry.org/masonicmuseum/fraternalism/catholic_orders.htm "Catholic Orders: Knights of Equity,"] Phoenix Masonry Museum, www.phoenixmasonry.org, 2010.</ref>

The organization is governed by an executive body known as the Supreme Council, headed by a chief executive officer known as the Worthy Supreme Sir Knight (WSSK).<ref>[http://www.knightsofequity.com/supreme.html "Supreme Council News,"] revised November 2001, www.knightsofequity.com</ref>

===Later development===

As their goals of non-discrimination and the financial security of Irish-Americans were accomplished over many decades, membership declined, and the social and [[philanthropy|philanthropic]] aspects of the organization gained increased importance.<ref>''Social Action, Volumes 31-32''. Council for Christian Social Action of the United Church of Christ, 1964; pg. 8.</ref> 

The center of the Knights of Equity's organizational strength over many decades has been in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]]. Shortly after the conclusion of [[World War II]] there remained about 1,100 members of the KOE in Pittsburgh alone.<ref name=PP0948>[http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1144&dat=19480916&id=4NIbAAAAIBAJ&sjid=MVEEAAAAIBAJ&pg=2926,219559 "Knights of Equity Open Convention,"] ''Pittsburgh Press,'' Sept. 16, 1948, pg. 27.</ref> The organization held its 53rd annual convention in that city in 1948, a three-day session attended by 500 delegates from 11 cities of the East and Midwest.<ref name=PP0948 /> At this juncture the group emphasized its patriotic nature, with assembled delegates demonstratively joining in a so-called "Freedom Pledge" to fight [[Communism]].<ref name=PP0948 /> The Pittsburgh court also mounted annual St. Patrick's Day banquets,<ref>[http://www.knightsofequity.com/pit_hist.html "History of Court Nine, Pittsburgh, PA"]. knightsofequity.com.</ref><ref>[http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=g7gaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=v0kEAAAAIBAJ&pg=3606,4190354&dq=knights-of-equity&hl=en "Knights of Equity Arrange Banquet St. Patrick's Day"]. ''[[Pittsburgh Press]]''. February 12, 1922.</ref> and in 1949 sponsored a football team.<ref>[http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=NX1IAAAAIBAJ&sjid=QmoDAAAAIBAJ&pg=3097,5751449&dq=knights-of-equity&hl=en "Knights of Equity Grid Team Seeks Victory".] ''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]''. October 16, 1949.</ref>

In 1954 the Knights of Equity added a so-called "women's auxiliary", known as the [[Daughters of Erin]] (DOE), to be comprised of wives and sisters of KOE members.<ref name=DOE>[http://www.knightsofequity.com/doehome.html "Daughters of Erin: History,"] updated September 2007, www.knightsofequity.com</ref> The DOE were to "aid the Knights of Equity financially, socially, and to further its aim, principles and causes," as well as to "participate in Catholic action and contribute to charity" and "foster [[Americanism (ideology)|Americanism]]."<ref name=DOE />
 
As of 2012{{cn|date=April 2012}} three active Knights of Equity Courts remain: "Court 9" in Pittsburgh, "Court 5" in [[Buffalo, New York]], and "Court 6" in [[Detroit, Michigan]].<ref name=Why /> The group today provides [[scholarships]] and conducts other philanthropic activities.{{cn|date=April 2012}}

===Archival holdings===

There are two partial archival holdings dedicated to the Knights of Equity, a small collection of early material at the Western Reserve Historical Society in Cleveland,<ref name=WRHS /> and a more extensive holding of later material dealing with Pittsburgh's Court 9, housed at the [[University of Pittsburgh]].<ref name=Pitt /> The Pittsburgh material is available on three reels of microfilm.<ref name=Pitt />
