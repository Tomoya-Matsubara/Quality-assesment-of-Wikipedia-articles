The is some disagreement about the correct dedication of the church.  Ormerod states it is dedicated to St Mary and All Saints.<ref>{{cite book | last =Ormerod | first =George | authorlink =George Ormerod | coauthors =Thomas Helsby (Ed.) | title =The History of the County Palatine and City of Chester |edition=2nd | publisher =George Routledge and Sons | date =1882 | location =London | pages =ii:223 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = }}</ref>  However a bequest in 1526 was made by Hugh Starkey of [[Oulton Estate|Oulton]] to "St. Peter of Budworth" and the church is usually now referred to as St Peter's.<ref name="richards">{{cite book | last =Richards | first =Raymond | title =Old Cheshire Churches | publisher =Batsford | date =1947 | location =London | pages =197&ndash;199}}</ref>

==History==

The precise date of foundation of the church is not known but the west tower was erected between 1490 and 1526.  The body of the church was rebuilt in stone in 1800 following a bequest from Ralph Kirkham, a wealthy merchant of [[Manchester]].  This consisted of a nave and sanctuary with no architectural division, which Richards describes as being "a poor attempt at imitation of the classical style".  In 1870 there was a restoration as  a result of which most of the fittings were lost.  By 1936 the roof timbers were becoming unsafe and they were replaced by a steel roof.<ref name="richards"/>  

==Structure==

The church is built in red [[sandstone]] [[ashlar]] with a slate roof.  The plan consists of a west tower with a nave and chancel in one range.<ref name="images"/>  The tower is [[perpendicular Period|perpendicular]] in style with windows of three lights, a string course with carvings of animals and heads, and an embattled top.  On the south face is a clock which was made in 1727 and a clock face dated 1785.<ref name="richards"/>  

==Fittings and furniture==

The ceilings of the nave and chancel are barrel vaults and are plastered.<ref name="images"/>  The [[pulpit]] dates from the [[Georgian era|Georgian]] period and the painted [[baptismal font|font]] from the 17th century.  The latter has a fluted bowl with a scrolled cover resting on an octagonal base.  It is one of the few painted fonts remaining in the county.  The Grey-Egertons of Oulton Park have a vault in the church which was sealed in 1870.  Memorials to members of the family include a brass relating to an incident in the [[Crimean War]].  Philip R. Egerton donated to the church a painting by [[Caravaggio]], or a member of his school, depicting ''[[Descent from the Cross|The Deposition from the Cross]]''.<ref name="richards"/>  A few fragments of pre-[[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] stained glass remain.<ref name="richards"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://merlin.cch.kcl.ac.uk:8080/cvma/servlet/site?countyCode=CH&place=Little%20Budworth&site=%20St%20Peter&LocationID=310&-querytype=2&county=Cheshire |title=	Little Budworth, St Peter |accessdate=2007-11-09|publisher=Corpus Vitrearum Medii Aevi (CVMA) of Great Britain (Stained glass) }}</ref>  The church plate includes a silver-gilt [[flagon]] from the late 17th century and a silver-gilt [[chalice]] and [[paten]] dated 1711.
