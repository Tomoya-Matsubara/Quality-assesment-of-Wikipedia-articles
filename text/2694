'''''Tsesarevich''''' (''{{lang-ru|<U+0426><U+0435><U+0441><U+0430><U+0440><U+0435><U+0432><U+0438><U+0447>}}'') was a [[pre-dreadnought battleship]] of the [[Imperial Russian Navy]], built in France at the end of the [[19th century]]. The ship's design formed the basis of the Russian-built {{Sclass-|Borodino|battleship|2}}s. She was based at [[L<U+00FC>shunkou District|Port Arthur]], [[Manchuria]] after entering service and fought in the [[Russo-Japanese War]] of 1904<U+2013>05. ''Tsesarevich'' was the [[flagship]] of [[Admiral]] [[Wilgelm Vitgeft]] in the [[Battle of the Yellow Sea]] and was [[interned]] in [[Tsingtau]] after the battle.

After the end of the war, the ship was transferred to the [[Baltic Fleet]] and helped to suppress the [[Sveaborg Rebellion]] in mid-1906. While on a Mediterranean cruise, she helped survivors of the [[1908 Messina earthquake]]. ''Tsesarevich'' was not very active during the early part of [[World War I]] and her bored sailors joined the general [[mutiny]] of the [[Baltic Fleet]] in early 1917. Now named ''Grazhdanin'', the ship participated in the [[Battle of Moon Sound]] in 1917, during which she was lightly damaged. The ship seized by the [[Bolsheviks]] during the [[Russian Revolution]] in late 1917 and [[Ship decommissioning|decommissioned]] the following year. ''Grazhdanin'' was [[ship breaking|scrapped]] in 1924<U+2013>1925.

==Design and description==
The ship was ordered as part of the "Programme for the Needs of the Far East", authorised by [[List of Russian rulers|Tsar]] [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]] in 1898 to defend Russia's newly acquired ice-free port of [[L<U+00FC>shunkou District|Port Arthur]] in [[Manchuria]]. Russian shipyards were already at full capacity so the Naval Ministry decided to order ships from abroad. Specifications were issued on 14 June 1898 and a few days later the chief designer of the French shipyard [[Soci<U+00E9>t<U+00E9> Nouvelle des Forges et Chantiers de la M<U+00E9>diterran<U+00E9>e|Forges et Chantiers de la M<U+00E9>diterran<U+00E9>e]] proposed a design based on that of the {{ship|French battleship|Jaur<U+00E9>guiberry}}. The Naval Technical Committee approved the design with a few changes to which the French readily agreed. The [[General Admiral]], [[Grand Duke Alexei Alexandrovich of Russia|Grand Duke Alexei Alexandrovich]] selected the French design over a competing proposal from the [[Baltic Works]]. A contract was signed on 20 July 1898 at a cost of 30.28 million [[franc]]s (11.355 million [[ruble]]s) for delivery in 42 months.<ref>McLaughlin, pp. 130<U+2013>31</ref>

''Tsesarevich''{{'}}s most obvious design feature was her [[tumblehome]] hull. This had several advantages because it allowed greater [[freeboard (nautical)|freeboard]] since the narrow upper decks reduced the structural weight of the vessel's hull, it increased the [[field of fire (weaponry)|field of fire]] of guns mounted on the sides, and it reduced the ship's roll in heavy seas. Its great disadvantage was that it reduced [[buoyancy]] and [[stability conditions|stability]] which contributed to excessive [[Heeling (sailing)|heel]] during turns.  During the Battle of the Yellow Sea in August 1904, [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] observers thought the ''Tsesarevich'' was going to capsize when she suddenly turned out of the battleline.<ref name=m2/>

''Tsesarevich'' was {{convert|118.5|m|ftin}} long [[length overall|long overall]], had a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|23.2|m|ftin}} and a [[Draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|7.92|m|ftin}}. The ship [[Displacement (ship)|displaced]] {{convert|13105|t|LT}}. Her crew consisted of 28<U+2013>29 officers and 750 enlisted men.<ref>McLaughlin, pp. 129<U+2013>30</ref>

The ship was powered by two [[Marine steam engine#Triple or multiple expansion|vertical triple-expansion steam engines]] using steam generated by 20 [[Belleville boiler]]s at a working pressure of {{convert|19|kg/cm2|kPa psi|0|abbr=on|lk=on}}. The boilers were fitted with [[economizer]]s that preheated their feed water. The engines were rated at {{convert|16300|ihp|lk=in}} and designed to reach a top speed of {{convert|18|kn|lk=in}}. ''Tsesarevich'' handily exceeded her design speed and reached {{convert|18.77|kn}} from {{convert|15254|ihp}} during her official machinery trials in July<U+2013>August 1903. She normally carried {{convert|800|LT|t}} of coal, but could carry a maximum of {{convert|1350|LT|t}}. This allowed the ship to steam for {{convert|5500|lk=in|nmi}} at a speed of {{convert|10|kn}}. ''Tsesarevich'' was fitted with six steam-driven generators with a total capacity of {{convert|550|kW|lk=in}}.<ref>McLaughlin, pp. 129<U+2013>30, 134<U+2013>35</ref>

=== Armament and fire control===
''Tsesarevich''{{'}}s [[Main battery|main armament]] consisted of two pairs of 40-[[caliber (artillery)|calibre]] [[Russian 12 inch 40 caliber naval gun|12-inch]] guns mounted in center-pivot, electrically powered, twin-[[gun turret]]s fore and aft. The guns and their mountings were Russian-built, but the turrets themselves were made in France. The guns could be loaded at all angles of elevation and the turrets could traverse 270<U+00B0>. Trials revealed that the ammunition hoists tended to jam when the ship was rolling; the shipyard shipped new hoists to Port Arthur because the Russians wanted the ship in the Far East as soon as possible and they were installed in January 1904. 70 [[Cartridge (firearms)|rounds]] per gun were carried.<ref name=m2/> The guns fired one shell every 90<U+2013>132 seconds.<ref>Forczyk, p. 29</ref> They fired a {{convert|731.3|lb|kg|adj=on}} shell at a [[muzzle velocity]] of {{convert|2598|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}<ref>Friedman, pp. 251<U+2013>52</ref> to a range of {{convert|14640|m|yd|disp=flip}} at an elevation of 15<U+00B0>.<ref>Forczyk, p. 28</ref>

The secondary armament of the ships consisted of a dozen 45-caliber [[Canet guns|Canet]] Model 1892 {{convert|6|in|mm|adj=on}} [[quick-firing gun|(QF) guns]] mounted in six electrically powered twin-gun turrets on the upper deck. The corner turrets had an 150<U+00B0> arc of fire and the center turrets could cover 180<U+00B0>. Each six-inch gun was provided with 200 rounds.<ref name=m2/> Their rate of fire was 2<U+2013>4 rounds per minute.<ref name=f0>Forczyk, p. 30</ref> They fired shells that weighed {{convert|41.4|kg|lb|abbr=on|disp=flip}} with a muzzle velocity of {{convert|792.5|m/s|ft/s|abbr=on|disp=flip}}.<ref>Friedman, pp. 260<U+2013>61</ref> They had a maximum range of approximately {{convert|12600|yd|m}}.<ref name=f0/>

A number of smaller guns were carried for defense against [[torpedo boat]]s. These included twenty 50-calibre Canet QF {{convert|75|mm|adj=on}} guns; 14 in hull [[embrasure]]s and the remaining six mounted on the superstructure. The ship carried 300 shells for each gun.<ref name=m2/> They fired a {{convert|4.9|kg|lb|adj=on|disp=flip}} shell at a muzzle velocity of {{convert|2700|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}} to a maximum range of {{convert|6405|m|yd|disp=flip}} at an elevation of 13<U+00B0>.<ref>Friedman, p. 264</ref> ''Tsesarevich'' also mounted twenty {{convert|47|mm|adj=on}} [[Hotchkiss gun]]s in the superstructure.<ref name=m2/> They fired a {{convert|2.2|lb|kg|adj=on}} shell at a muzzle velocity of {{convert|1400|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}<ref>Smigielski, p. 160</ref> at a rate of around 15 rounds per minute.<ref name=f0/> Eight smaller {{convert|37|mm|adj=on}} Hotchkiss guns were also fitted, but their locations are unknown.<ref name=m2>McLaughlin, p. 132</ref>

The ship carried four {{convert|381|mm|in|adj=on}} [[torpedo tube]]s; two of these were mounted above water in the bow and stern, and the two [[broadside]] underwater tubes were located near the forward 12-inch [[magazine (artillery)|magazine]]. ''Tsesarevich'' carried a total of 14 torpedoes. The ship also carried 45 [[Naval mine|mines]] to be laid to protect her anchorage in remote areas.<ref name=m2/>

The ship was fitted with two [[Barr and Stroud]] [[coincidence rangefinder]]s that used two images that had to be superimposed to derive the range. The gunnery officer then calculated the proper elevation and [[deflection (ballistics)|deflection]] required to hit the target and transmitted his commands via a Geisler electro-mechanical [[Fire-control system#Naval fire control|fire-control transmission system]] to each turret.<ref name=m2/><ref>Forczyk, pp. 28, 57</ref>

=== Protection ===
''Tsesarevich'' used the latest [[Krupp armor]] in a version of the French cellular armor scheme. This consisted of a full-length [[waterline]] [[Belt armor|armoured belt]] with armored [[deck (ship)|deck]]s above and below. Behind the belt were well-subdivided compartments mostly used to store coal. This was intended to keep the ship afloat regardless of the damage inflicted above the upper armoured deck. The waterline armor belt was {{convert|2|m|ftin}} high, with {{convert|1.5|m|ftin}} below the waterline at normal load. It had a maximum thickness of {{convert|250|mm|in|1}} for a length of {{convert|60|m|ftin}} amidships which gradually reduced to a thickness of {{convert|180|mm|in|1}} at the bow and {{convert|170|mm|in|1}}. The belt tapered to a thickness of 170 millimetres at its bottom edge amidships and presumably tapered proportionally along its length. Above the waterline belt was an upper [[strake]] of armour that was {{convert|1.67|m|ftin}} high and had a maximum thickness of {{convert|200|mm|in|1}}. It was slightly shorter than the waterline belt and similarly reduced in thickness towards the ends of the ship. Forward it consisted of {{convert|120|mm|in|1|adj=on}} armour plates and {{convert|130|mm|in|1}} aft.<ref>McLaughlin, pp. 132<U+2013>34</ref>

The armor of the main gun turrets and their supporting tubes was 250 millimetres thick with roofs {{convert|63|mm|in}} thick. Below the upper armour deck the armour of the support tubes decreased to {{convert|100|mm|in|1}}. The turrets of the secondary armament had {{convert|150|mm|in|1|adj=on}} sides with {{convert|30|mm|in|1}} roofs. The sides of the [[conning tower]] were {{convert|254|mm|in|1}} thick and it had a 63-millimetre roof. It had a communications tube that extended down to the upper armoured deck that was protected by 100-millimetre armour. The [[funnel (ship)|funnel]] uptakes were protected by {{convert|19|mm|in|1}} of armour for the height of one deck above the upper armoured deck.<ref name=m4>McLaughlin, p. 134</ref>

Above the upper armour belt there was a deck that ran the full length of the ship that consisted of a {{convert|50|mm|in|adj=on}} armour plate laid on {{convert|10|mm|in|adj=on}} deck plating. At the top of the waterline belt was two layers of {{convert|20|mm|in|adj=on}} armour. It also extended the full length of the ship, but not the full width; it curved downward behind the belt and was connected to the lower edge of the belt by a 20-millimetre plate. It continued downward to the ship's inner bottom plates and formed a sort of [[torpedo bulkhead]]. This bulkhead was {{convert|2|m|ftin}} from the side of the ship and extended for a length of {{convert|84|m|ftin}}. It was backed with coal bunkers.<ref name=m4/>

==Construction and service==
[[Image:Tsesarevich Russian Battleship.jpg|thumb|left|Midships of ''Tsesarevich'']]
Construction began on ''Tsesarevich'', named after the title of the [[Tsesarevich|heir to the Russian throne]],<ref>Silverstone, p. 387</ref> on 18 May 1899 at the Forges et Chantiers de la M<U+00E9>diterran<U+00E9>e shipyard in [[La Seyne-sur-Mer]], France. The ship was [[Keel|laid down]] on 8 July 1899 and [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] on 23 February 1901. Construction was supervised by Captain [[Ivan Grigorovich]], who became the ship's first [[captain (nautical)|captain]]. ''Tsesarevich'' entered service in August 1903 and was assigned to the [[Far East]]. She arrived in Port Arthur on 2 December 1903.<ref>McLaughlin, p. 135</ref> Upon completion, the ''Tsesarevich'' was the Russian Navy's best battleship at the beginning of the Russo-Japanese War.<ref>Forczyk, p. 18</ref>

===Russo-Japanese War===
She was one of three ships to be struck by Japanese torpedoes during the surprise attack on Port Arthur during the night of 8/9 February 1904. ''Tsesarevich'' was hit [[abaft]] the portside torpedo bulkhead and the ship took on a 18<U+00B0> [[list (watercraft)|list]] that was partially corrected by counterflooding compartments on the starboard side. She got underway, but ran aground at the narrow harbor entrance. She was refloated and moved into the harbour for repairs that lasted until 7 June. Some of the ship's guns were removed during the summer to reinforce the defenses of the port. ''Tsesarevich'' lost a total of four 75-millimeter, two 47-millimeter and two 37-millimeter guns.<ref>McLaughlin, pp. 135, 160<U+2013>61, 163</ref> The ship was hit twice on 7 August by Japanese {{convert|4.7|in|mm|adj=on}} shells fired at long range; a fragment from one of them lightly wounded Vitgeft.<ref>Forczyk, p. 48</ref> 

On the morning of 10 August 1904, the [[First Pacific Squadron]] sortied from Port Arthur in an attempt to break through the Japanese fleet blockading the port and reach [[Vladivostok]]. The Russian squadron consisted of five battleships, ''Tsesarevich'', {{Ship|Russian battleship|Retvizan||2}}, {{Ship|Russian battleship|Pobeda||2}}, ''[[Russian battleship Peresvet|Peresvet]]'', ''[[Russian battleship Sevastopol (1895)|Sevastopol]]'' and [[Japanese battleship Tango|''Poltava'']], along with four protected cruisers and eight destroyers.  The Japanese fleet, commanded by [[Admiral Togo]], was comprised four battleships, {{Ship|Japanese battleship|Mikasa||2}}, {{Ship|Japanese battleship|Asahi||2}}, {{Ship|Japanese battleship|Fuji||2}}, {{Ship|Japanese battleship|Shikishima||2}}, two armoured cruisers {{Ship|Japanese cruiser|Nishin||2}} and {{Ship|Japanese cruiser|Kasuga||2}}, as well as seven protected cruisers.<ref>Forczyk, pp. 48, 50<U+2013>51</ref>

''Tsesarevich'' and ''Pobeda'' both suffered mechanical problems within an hour of departure that forced the fleet to slow down to a speed of {{convert|13|kn}}. Togo failed in his attempt to [[Crossing the T|cross the Russian's T]] after spotting them around 12:25 and and a general engagement began around 13:25 with the Japanese ships concentrating their fire on ''Tsesarevich'' and ''Retvizan'', but the effective Russian fire forced Togo to disengage around 15:20. He closed with the Russians about two hours later and opened fire at 17:35. Neither side was able to mortally damage any ships while the Russians were still in the lead with about a half-hour of daylight left when two 12-inch shells fired by ''Asahi'' struck near ''Tsesarevich''{{'}}s conning tower at 18:40. Shell fragments bounced off the conning tower's overhanging roof into the conning tower, killing Vitgeft, two staff officers and the [[helmsman]]. The ship turned to port with the steering wheel jammed and was followed by several other battleships. ''Tsesarevich'' became the focus of attention from every Japanese ship so the captain of ''Retvizan'' decided to charge the Japanese battleline to buy time for ''Tsesarevich'' to fix her steering problem. He succeeded in doing so and the squadron's second-in-command, Rear Admiral Prince [[Pavel Ukhtomsky]] gradually asserted command over the scattered Russian ships and ordered them back to Port Arthur in the darkness.<ref>Forczyk, pp. 48, 50<U+2013>53</ref> ''Tsesarevich'' attempted to head north to Vladivostok in the dark, but her damaged funnels greatly increased her coal consumption and reduced her speed to only {{convert|6|kn}} so that she was forced to head for the German [[treaty port]] of Tsingtau instead with three destroyers for escort. Upon arrival the following day, ''Tsesarevich'' and her companions were interned and disarmed. The ship had been hit by thirteen 12-inch and two {{convert|8|in|adj=on}} shells<ref>McLaughlin, p. 163</ref> that killed 12 and wounded 47 members of her crew.<ref>Forczyk, p. 52</ref>

At the end of the Russo-Japanese war, the ship was transferred to the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] in early 1906 and helped to suppress the Sveaborg Rebellion later that year. Around 1906, her [[Top (sailing ship)|fighting top]] was removed and her superstructure was cut down. The 75 mm guns in the superstructure were apparently removed as well. ''Tsesarevich'' made regular winter cruises to the Mediterranean before World War I and aided survivors of the Messina earthquake in December 1908. In 1909<U+2013>10 the ship's machinery was [[wikt:overhaul|overhauled]] and her amidships casemated 75 mm guns were removed and plated over four years later. ''Tsesarevich'' was not very active during the early part of [[World War I]] and she reportedly received two 37 mm [[anti-aircraft gun]]s during the war. Because of her inactivity her bored sailors joined the general [[mutiny]] of the [[Baltic Fleet]] in early 1917. She was renamed ''Grazhdanin'' (''{{lang-ru|<U+0413><U+0440><U+0430><U+0436><U+0434><U+0430><U+043D><U+0438><U+043D>}}'' (meaning ''Citizen'')) on 13 April 1917 after the [[February Revolution]].<ref>McLaughlin, pp. 135, 295, 300<U+2013>02</ref> The ship took part in the Battle of Moon Sound in October 1917. During the climatic part of the battle, ''Grazhdanin'' engaged the German minesweepers on 17 October with little effect while {{ship|Russian battleship|Slava||2}} engaged the German dreadnoughts {{SMS|K<U+00F6>nig||2}} and {{SMS|Kronprinz||2}}. The latter fired at ''Grazhdanin'' and hit her twice, killing one and wounding four crewmen, although neither hit caused significant damage. The German dreadnoughts outranged ''Grazhdanin'' and she was forced to retreat and abandon [[Moon Sound]] in the face of German pressure.<ref>Staff, pp. 114<U+2013>16, 139</ref>

By December the ship was in Kronstadt where she came under the control of the Bolsheviks and she was [[Ship breaking|hulked]] there in May 1918. ''Grazhdanin'' was scrapped beginning in 1924, although she was not officially stricken from the Navy List until 21 November 1925.<ref>McLaughlin, pp. 135, 301</ref>
