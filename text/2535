'''''Murderworks''''' is the third [[studio album]] by the Finnish [[grindcore]] band [[Rotten Sound]]. The album was recorded at Soundlab studios with production of [[Mieszko Talarczyk]].

== Release ==
''Murderworks'' was released in June 2002 through [[Death vomit records|Deathvomit Records]] (a subsidiary of [[Necropolis Records]]) in the United States, and [[Century Media Records|Century Media]] in Europe, where the album's artwork was censored by manufacturers in Germany, who considered the original cover and band photos too disturbing for German consumers.<ref name="Disturbing">{{cite news|url=http://www.bravewords.com/news/1994|title=Rotten Sound Too Disturbing!|date=2 June 2002|publisher=''[[BW&BK]]''|accessdate=7 May 2009}}</ref> As a replacement, the cover was re-colored in shades of red and white, with a note on top saying, "Check booklet for original artwork."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chapitre.com/CHAPITRE/fr/MUSIC/rotten-sound/murderworks,897551.aspx |title=Murderworks details |publisher=Chapitre.com |language=French |accessdate=7 May 2009}}</ref>

The album also includes two live videos for "Seeds" and "Strongman," and the "Targets" music video, which later appeared on the ''Murderlive'' DVD, released in 2004.<ref name="Disturbing" /> ''Murderworks'' was reissued by [[Relapse Records]] in 2005,<ref name="Pop Rocks" /> and regarding this re-release, critics have different opinions. While a review in the ''[[Exclaim!]]'' magazine defined this reissue of ''Murderworks'' as "essential to the grind[core] fan,"<ref name="Pop Rocks">{{cite web|url=http://exclaim.ca/musicreviews/generalreview.aspx?csid1=76&csid2=850&fid1=19486|title=Pop Rocks: Rotten Sound - Murderworks|date=December 2005|publisher=''Exclaim!''|accessdate=6 May 2009}}</ref> Kevin Stewart-Panko from ''[[Decibel (magazine)|Decibel]]'' quoted it with a question, which says: "The easiest reissue job ever?" He also noted that "the actual recording doesn't appear to have been remastered" and concluded his review stating, "Maybe the advantage with Relapse reissuing this is that, this time, it<U+2019>ll actually get released."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.decibelmagazine.com/reviews/jan2006/rotten_sound.aspx |title=Review of Murderworks |accessdate=8 May 2009 |author=Stewart-Panko, Kevin |date=January 2006 |work=[[Decibel (magazine)|Decibel]] |publisher=Red Flag Media |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060506040446/www.decibelmagazine.com/reviews/jan2006/rotten_sound.aspx |archivedate=6 May 2006}}</ref>

== Critical reception ==
[[Allmusic]] writer Alex Henderson, stated that "from start to finish, ''Murderworks'' is an exercise in sensory assault for the sake of sensory assault."<ref name="hbfuxq90ldte" /> Henderson defined the band's tempo as "insanely fast", and criticized their "one-dimensional" musical style, comparing with Rotten Sound's previous releases, saying: <blockquote>
After you have heard the opening number, "Targets," you've pretty much heard it all; headbangers who like their metal albums with a lot of variety won't find it here. But despite the CD's obvious limitations, ''Murderworks'' is, in its own way, exhilarating<U+2014>that is, if you have a taste for this type of extreme metal.<ref name="hbfuxq90ldte" />
</blockquote>

Evaluating all aspects of ''Murderworks'', [[Chronicles of Chaos (webzine)|Chronicles of Chaos]] reviewer Aaron McKay gave the album six out of ten stars, saying, "Fourteen tracks of single-word titles rip unforgivingly and in a way such that enjoyment can be easily gained from every cut to some degree."<ref name="CoC" /> He also stated, "Anger, violence and aggression are, of course, the staples on which ''Murderworks'' fuels its insatiable appetite."<ref name="CoC" />
