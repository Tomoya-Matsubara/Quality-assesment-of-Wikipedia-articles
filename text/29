There is nothing to imply there is [an infectious process], but our mind is open to everything, including that remote possibility." Since then, the CDC has launched a funded study (see below) that will include further examination of fibers taken from Morgellons lesions by the CDC.

In June 2007, the CDC opened a website on "Unexplained Dermopathy (aka 'Morgellons')".<ref name="Investigation"/> By November 2007, the CDC had announced an investigation process, stating that, "The primary goals of the investigation are to better describe the clinical and epidemiologic features of this condition and to generate hypotheses about possible risk factors."<ref name="Investigation"/> [[Kaiser Permanente]] in Northern California was chosen to assist with investigation, which will begin when the scientific protocols and review board structure have been prepared and approved.  Investigators will report on the geographic distribution of the illness and estimate rates of illness in affected communities. The investigation will involve skin biopsies from affected patients and characterization of foreign material such as fibers or threads obtained from patients to determine their potential source.<ref name="Investigation"/><ref>{{cite news |first=Mike |last=Stobbe |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/sns-ap-morgellons-cdc,0,5755057,print.story |title=U.S. to Study Bizarre Medical Condition |publisher=Chicago Tribune |date=2008-01-16 }}</ref> In January 2008 it was reported that CDC was enlisting the aid of the U.S. Armed Forces Institute of Pathology and the American Academy of Dermatology "to conduct 'immediate' and 'rigorous' research."<ref name="CDC_AFIP_AAD">{{cite news |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080118/NATION/36179823/1002 |title=CDC enlists military to study skin ailment |first=Jennifer |last=Harper |publisher=The Washington Times |date=2008-01-18 }}</ref>

Following a mailing campaign coordinated by the Morgellons Research Foundation in which "self-described sufferers clicked on the foundation Web site and sent thousands of form letters to members of Congress,"<ref name="Schulte"/> the CDC, in conjunction with Kaiser Permanente's Northern California Division of Research, launched a study of the unexplained skin condition known as Morgellons. A press conference was held on Jan 16, 2008, with Michele Pearson, principal investigator for the CDC, and Joe Selby, Director of Kaiser Permanente's Northern California Division of Research.<ref name="CDC-STUDY">{{cite news |url=http://www.cdc.gov/media/transcripts/2008/t080116.htm|title=CDC to Launch Study on Unexplained Illness|publisher=CDC |date=2008-01-16 }}</ref> During the press conference, Pearson stated: "What I can tell you is real is the suffering that these patients are experiencing. I cannot characterize this as a syndrome, as disease. I can tell you it's an unexplained illness." Clinical examinations for the study will be done in [[Oakland, California]].

On 4 November 2009, the CDC issued a preliminary report based on an external peer review of the project. The report stated that "Data collection has been completed and analysis is ongoing."<ref>http://www.cdc.gov/unexplaineddermopathy/docs/ud_peer_review_progress-nov_2009.pdf</ref> This report also explained that any findings would most likely be published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal once data analysis is complete and results are available.

== Symptoms and diagnosis ==
Morgellons is not recognized as a unique disorder, so there is currently no list of symptoms or [[differential diagnosis]] for Morgellons that is generally accepted by the medical community. Patients usually self-diagnose based on media reports and the internet.

The 2007 ''Atlas of Human Parasitology'' covers the proposed condition in its section on "Pseudoparasites and Artifacts":

{{quote|Many dermatologists refute the suggestion that this is an actual disease but instead indicate that many of these patients have psychological problems or other common skin disorders.  Given the large numbers of individuals who feel that they have this affliction, it will be most helpful over the coming years to have a valid scientific assessment of Morgellons disease and its possible etiology (or etiologies).  One of the chief criticisms by many patients has been that they feel the medical community and other scientists consulted have not been open to the idea that there is possibly an as yet unidentified infectious or physiologic causation for the disease. However it is certainly true that in fact many expert parasitologists, medical entomologists and other microbiologists have in fact carefully examined fibers and other materials expressed or extracted from such patients and found that biological organisms are not present. Although an apparent association of the condition with the presence of Lyme disease has been reported (Savely et al., 2006, Am J Clin Dermatol, 7:1<U+2013>6), further research will be needed to help resolve the validity of Morgellons disease.  Until then, whether Morgellons disease is another name for delusional parasitosis or a real disease entity with a biologic or physiologic basis will remain up in the air.<ref name="Atlas">{{cite book |last=Ash |first=L.R. |coauthors=Orihel, T.C. |year=2007 |title=Atlas of Human Parasitology |edition=5 |publisher=American Society for Clinical Pathology Press |location=Chicago, Illinois |pages=386<U+2013>387 |isbn=0891891676 }}</ref>}}

In delusional parasitosis, patients hold a delusional belief that they are infested with parasites. They may experience [[formication]], a sensation similar to that of insects crawling on or under the skin. Individuals suffering from this condition may develop elaborate rituals of inspection and cleansing to locate and remove "parasites" and fibers, resulting in a form of self-mutilation; they injure themselves in attempts to be rid of the "parasites" by picking at the skin, causing [[lesion]]s, and then pick at the lesions, preventing them from healing.<ref name="AJP"/> Patients with delusional parasitosis often present at the doctor's office with what MDs term the "[[matchbox sign]]"<ref name="AJCD"/><ref name=koo>{{cite journal |last=Koo |first=Lebwohl |url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/20011201/1873.html |title=Psychodermatology: The Mind and Skin Connection |journal=American Family Physician |volume=64 |issue=11 |date=2001-12-01 }}</ref> -- a [[medical sign]] characterized by the patient making collections of fibers and other foreign objects supposedly retrieved from the skin<ref name="AJP"/> -- and, because of "unshakeable delusional ideation", strongly reject diagnoses that do not involve parasites.<ref name="AJCD"/><ref name="DermTher">{{cite journal |doi= 10.1111/j.1529-8019.2008.00163.x |title= Delusions of parasitosis |year= 2008 |author= Lee, Chai Sue |journal= Dermatologic Therapy |volume= 21 |pages= 2 |pmid= 18318879 |issue= 1 }}</ref> A significant minority of DP cases occur in groups of two, three, or more individuals in close proximity, even families, known by the French terms ''[[folie <U+00E0> deux]]'', ''[[folie <U+00E0> trois]]'', and ''[[folie <U+00E0> famille]]''.<ref name="AJCD"/> Delusional parasitosis, with symptoms that have "extraordinary similarities" to Morgellons, has been described in the medical literature for over 75 years.<ref name="JAAD">{{cite journal |last=Koblenzer |first=C.S. |title=The challenge of Morgellons disease |journal=J Am Acad Dermatol |year=2006 |volume=55 |pages=920<U+2013>922 |pmid=17052516 |doi=10.1016/j.jaad.2006.04.043 |issue=5 }}</ref> Dr. Noah Craft, a dermatologist at the Harbor-[[UCLA]] Medical Center, [[Torrance, California|Torrance, CA]], has seen a handful of Morgellons patients and biopsied their skin lesions, but found only normal skin and inflammation, as one would find in a bump that has been picked at.<ref name="psychologytoday"/>

Some cases of delusional parasitosis have organic causes other than those associated with neurological/psychological conditions of unknown etiology. For example, formication, the sensation that bugs are crawling under ones' skin, can be caused by allergies, [[diabetic neuropathy]], [[menopause]], [[skin cancer]], [[demodex]] mites, stimulant drug abuse or [[herpes zoster]]. Both dementia and mental retardation have been reported in association with DP.<ref name="Slaughter">Slaughter JR et al.

The MRF's William Harvey has written that non-healing "Morgellons lesions" have been found on infants' bodies in locations that the infants cannot themselves reach to scratch.<ref name="Harvey"/> In his letter to the editor, he does not provide evidence to support this claim.

Some cases of Morgellons have been diagnosed as "cutaneous dysaesthesia".<ref name="Pop"/>

=== Role of the Internet ===
Morgellons patients usually self-diagnose on the [[Internet]] and find support and confirmation in on-line communities of people with similar illness beliefs.<ref name="AJPVR"/><ref name="PsychosomaticsLMS">{{cite journal|coauthors=Lustig A, Mackay S, Strauss J |title=Morgellons Disease as Internet Meme |journal=Psychosomatics |year=2009 |volume=50 |pages=90 |pmid=19213978 |url=http://psy.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/full/50/1/90 |doi = 10.1176/appi.psy.50.1.90|last1=Lustig|first1=A|issue=1 }}</ref><ref name="Healy"/> In 2006, Waddell and Burke reported the influence of the Internet on their self-diagnosed Morgellons patients: "physicians are becoming more and more challenged by the many persons who attempt self-diagnosis on-line.

The ''LA Times'', in an article on Morgellons, notes that "(t)he recent upsurge in symptoms can be traced directly to the Internet, following the naming of the disease by Mary Leitao, a Pennsylvania mother."<ref name="Healy"/> Robert Bartholomew, a sociologist who has studied the Morgellons phenomenon, states that the "World Wide Web has become the incubator for mass delusion and it (Morgellons) seems to be a socially transmitted disease over the Internet."

=== Known skin conditions ===
It has been hypothesized that some cases of (self-diagnosed) Morgellons disease are actually other recognized skin disorders, including allergic dermatitis, [[contact dermatitis]], and the parasite [[scabies]].<ref name="nature"/><ref name="JAAD"/>

=== Hypotheses about the fibers ===
Randy Wymore, a former research director of the MRF and presently director of the Oklahoma State University Center for Health Sciences' Center for the Investigation of Morgellons Disease, claims that Morgellons patients have masses of dark fibers visible at 60x magnification under the unbroken skin, while unaffected individuals do not.<ref name=nature/> Wymore sent samples of fibers supplied by Morgellons patients to the Police Crime Lab in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]], for analysis. A forensic scientist at the Tulsa Police Crime Lab in Oklahoma searched the FBI's national database, but the Morgellons sample did not match any known fiber in the database.<ref name="Primetime" /> Lab director Mark Boese said the fibers were "consistent with something that the body may be producing," adding, "These fibers cannot be manmade and do not come from a plant. This could be a byproduct of a biological organism."<ref name="Primetime">{{cite news |title='Morgellons' Mystery |publisher=ABC News Primetime |date=2006-08-09 |accessdate=2007-08-14 |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Primetime/Story?id=2283503&page=1}}</ref>

Rhonda Casey, chief of pediatrics at Oklahoma State University Hospital and part of the MRF research team at OSU, claimed that she has examined many patients' skin via a [[dermatoscope]] and performed biopsies on both lesions and apparently healthy skin, and that "she saw fibers embedded in both places. The white ones, she says, are hard to see. A dermatologist who either didn't look at all, or didn't use a dermatoscope, might not see them under the skin."<ref name="psychologytoday"/>

=== Bacterial hypothesis ===
Three members of the Morgellons Research Foundation, including Raphael Stricker, Director and former President of the International Lyme and Associated Diseases Society (ILADS), and Ginger Savely, also an ILADS member,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ilads.org |title=International Lyme and Associated Diseases Society (ILADS) }}</ref> authored an article about Morgellons published by the ''American Journal of Clinical Dermatology'' in early 2006. The authors wrote that "Morgellons disease may be linked to an undefined infectious process," and reported that many patients with Morgellons disease have positive [[Western blot]]s for ''[[Borrelia burgdorferi]]'', the causative agent of [[Lyme disease]], and treatment with anti-bacterials appropriate for Lyme disease leads to remission of Morgellons symptoms in most patients;<ref name="AJCD"/> however, no methodology or clinical data are provided in support of any of these claims.  Harvey, another member of ILADS, has also stated there is [[serology|serological]] evidence of bacterial pathogens in Morgellons patients, but did not provide any such evidence.<ref name="Harvey"/> Stricker, along with Citovsky, MRF board member from the [[State University of New York at Stony Brook]], claimed that Morgellons skin fibers could come from ''[[Agrobacterium]]'', a plant-infecting organism known to induce cellulose fibers at infected sites within plant tissues.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Stricker |first1=R.B. |last2=Savely |first2=V.R. |last3=Zaltsman |first3=A. |last4=Citovsky |first4=V. |title=Contribution of ''Agrobacterium'' to morgellons disease |journal=J Invest Med |year=2007 |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=S123 #287 Suppl.

=== Environmental toxins ===
Richard Fagerlund, an entomologist who has a column titled "Ask the Bugman" in the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' and ''[[Albuquerque Journal]]'', stated that he takes Morgellons disease seriously, and he receives letters from people with Morgellons symptoms daily. Twenty years ago, he got three to four letters like this a year. He believes the condition is reaching epidemic proportions and speculates only a small percentage of cases are delusional parasitosis, while the rest may be caused by something else, such as pollutants, especially [[pesticide]]s.<ref name="SFchron">{{cite news |title=Persistent scabies-like condition may not be all in people's heads |first=Richard |last=Fagerlund |publisher=San Francisco Chronicle |date=2006-12-30 |page=F-6 |url=http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/12/30/HOG2VN91IS1.DTL  }}</ref>

== Treatment ==
=== Treatment for delusional parasitosis ===
Many dermatologists treat Morgellons as delusional parasitosis. After a thorough medical examination to rule out known organic causes for the symptoms, delusional parasitosis patients are typically prescribed one of several [[typical antipsychotic]] drugs.<ref name="Koo">{{Cite journal |last1=Koo |first1=J. |last2=Lee |first2=C.S. |title=Delusions of Parasitosis: A Dermatologist's Guide to Diagnosis and Treatment |journal=Am J Clin Dermatol |year=2001 |volume=2 |issue=5 |pages=285<U+2013>290 |pmid=11721647 |doi=10.2165/00128071-200102050-00003 }}</ref><ref name="Meehan">{{Cite journal |last1=Meehan |first=W.J. |last2=Badreshia |first2=S. |last3=Mackley |first3=C.L. |title=Successful treatment of delusions of parasitosis with olanzapine |date=2006-03 |journal=Arch Dermatol |volume=142 |issue=3 |pages=352<U+2013>355 |pmid=16549712 |url=http://archderm.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/142/3/352 |doi=10.1001/archderm.142.3.352 }}</ref> In the past, [[pimozide]] was the drug of choice; in addition to antipsychotic activity, it also has [[antipruritic]] activity, meaning it inhibits the sensation of itching.<ref name="Koblenzer">{{cite journal |last=Koblenzer |first=C.S. |title=Pimozide at least as safe and perhaps more effective than olanzapine for treatment of Morgellons disease |year=2006 |journal=Arch Dermatol |volume=142 |issue=10 |pages=1364 |pmid=17043201 |doi=10.1001/archderm.142.10.1364-b }}</ref> However, pimozide requires frequent electrocardiographic monitoring.<ref name="Meehan"/> Currently, [[atypical antipsychotic]]s such as [[olanzapine]] or [[risperidone]] are used as first line treatment.<ref name="Meehan"/> Antipsychotics are effective at treating delusional parasitosis at doses as low as one-fifth to one-tenth the dose typically prescribed for schizophrenia.<ref name="Meehan"/> It is common for patients who believe they have Morgellons to reject a physician's diagnosis of delusional parasitosis.  It has been suggested that the term Morgellons should be adopted by dermatologists to enhance their [[rapport]] with their patients, allowing them to overcome this resistance.<ref name="Murase">{{Cite journal |last1=Murase |first=J.E. |last2=Wu |first2=J.J. |last3=Koo |first3=J. |title=Morgellons disease: A rapport-enhancing term for delusions of parasitosis |journal=J Am Acad Dermatol |year=2006 |volume=55 |issue=5 |pages=913<U+2013>914 |pmid=17052509 |url=http://www.eblue.org/article/PIIS0190962206012175/fulltext |doi=10.1016/j.jaad.2006.04.042 }}</ref>

A ''Popular Mechanics'' article described a dermatologist who would not allow the use of his name, citing "concern for his safety." He said he has "diagnosed 50 or so Morgellons patients" with a disorder that can result in the sensation of insects, and "typically puts a cast over the lesions to prevent further irritation and after four weeks removes it." According to the doctor, the patients' lesions heal under the cast.<ref name="Pop"/>

=== Treatment for infectious disease ===
People who say they have Morgellons frequently reject the diagnosis of delusional parasitosis,<ref name="Pop">{{cite news |url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/health_medicine/1662162.html |title=Morgellons Disease Baffles Patients And Doctors |first=Benjamin |last=Chertoff |publisher=Popular Mechanics |date=2005-06 }}</ref> "report that their symptoms are not taken seriously,"<ref name="AJCD"/> and refuse psychotropic medicine.

They advise against prescribing antibiotics, which may reinforce the patients' delusions instead of addressing what these doctors consider the core problem: delusional parasitosis.<ref name="Accordino"/> In addition, long-term antibiotic use can have serious side effects.

=== Self-treatment ===
Persons with Morgellons symptoms may turn to alternative remedies described on web sites and discussion groups. Some treatments are dangerous, however, and have included the use of bleach, veterinary medicines intended for deworming horses, and industrial insecticides.<ref name="CDC Probes"/>
