The '''Colorado River''' is the principal river of the [[American Southwest|southwestern]] [[United States]] and northwest [[Mexico]]. The {{convert|1450|mi|km|sing=on}} river drains an expansive, arid [[drainage basin|watershed]] that encompasses parts of seven U.S. and two Mexican states. Rising in the central [[Rocky Mountains]] in the U.S., the river flows generally southwest across the [[Colorado Plateau]] before reaching [[Lake Mead]] on the [[Arizona]]<U+2013>[[Nevada]] line, where it turns south towards the international border. After entering Mexico, the Colorado forms a large [[River delta|delta]], emptying into the [[Gulf of California]] between [[Baja California]] and [[Sonora]].

Known for its dramatic canyons and whitewater rapids, the Colorado is a vital source of water for agricultural and urban areas in the southwestern desert lands of North America.<ref name="leesferrycompact">{{cite web

Beginning with small bands of nomadic [[hunter-gatherer]]s, [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] have inhabited the Colorado River basin for at least 8,000 years. Between 2,000 and 1,000 years ago, the river and its tributaries fostered large, sedentary agricultural civilizations, which may have been some of the most sophisticated indigenous cultures in North America. These societies are believed to have collapsed due to a combination of severe drought and poor land use practices. Most native peoples that inhabit the river basin today are descended from other groups that settled in the region beginning about 1,000 years ago. [[Europe]]ans first entered the Colorado River watershed in the 16th&nbsp;century, when explorers from Spain began mapping and claiming the area, which later became part of Mexico upon its independence from Spain in 1821. Early contact between foreigners and natives was generally limited to the [[North American fur trade|fur trade]] in the headwaters and sporadic trade interactions along the lower river.

After the Colorado River basin became part of the U.S. in 1846, the river's course was still largely unknown, and the whereabouts of its headwaters and mouth were still the subject of myths and speculation. Several expeditions charted the Colorado in the mid-19th&nbsp;century, of which one was the first to run the rapids of the [[Grand Canyon]], led by [[John Wesley Powell]] in 1869. American explorers collected valuable information that would later be used to investigate the feasibility of developing the river for navigation and water supply. Large-scale settlement of the lower basin began in the mid-to-late 19th&nbsp;century, with [[steamboat]]s providing transportation and trade along the Colorado and [[Gila River|Gila]] rivers. Lesser numbers settled in the upper basin, which was also the setting of major gold strikes in the 1860s and 1870s.

Major engineering of the river basin began around the start of the 20th&nbsp;century, with many guidelines for development established in a series of domestic and international treaties known as the "Law of the River". The U.S. federal government was the main driving force behind the construction of hydraulic engineering projects in the river system, although many state and local water agencies were also involved. Most of the major dams in the river basin were built between 1910 and 1970, with the system keystone, [[Hoover Dam]], completed in 1935.  Because of these developments, the Colorado River is now considered among the most controlled and litigated in the world, with every drop of its water fully allocated. High rates of water removal for irrigation and industry combined with declines in natural runoff due to climate change could lead to severe shortages by the mid-21st&nbsp;century, endangering power generation and water supply.

The construction of dams and associated [[water export]] schemes on the Colorado River system have been a flashpoint for the [[environmental movement]] in the American Southwest, due to their impacts on the ecology and natural beauty of the river and its tributaries. During the construction of [[Glen Canyon Dam]], environmental organizations vowed to block any further development of the river, and a number of later dam and aqueduct proposals were defeated by citizen opposition. As demands for Colorado River water continue to rise, the level of human development and control of the river continues to generate controversy.

The Colorado River basin shares drainage boundaries with many other major watersheds of North America. The Continental Divide of the Americas forms a large portion of the eastern boundary of the watershed, separating it from the basins of the [[Yellowstone River]] and the [[Platte River]] <U+2013> both tributaries of the [[Missouri River]] <U+2013> on the northeast, and from the headwaters of the [[Arkansas River]] on the east. Both the Missouri and Arkansas rivers are part of the [[Mississippi River]] system.

==Geology==
As recently as the [[Cretaceous]] period 100&nbsp;million years ago, much of western North America was still part of the [[Pacific Ocean]]. Tectonic forces from the collision of the [[Farallon Plate]] with the [[North American Plate]] pushed up the Rocky Mountains between 75 and 50&nbsp;million years ago in a mountain-building episode known as the [[Laramide orogeny]].{{sfn|Prisciantelli|2002|p=56}} The Colorado first formed as a west-flowing stream draining the southwestern portion of the range, and the uplift also diverted the Green River from its original course to the Mississippi River west towards the Colorado. About 30 to 20&nbsp;million years ago, volcanic activity related to the orogeny led to the [[Mid-Tertiary ignimbrite flare-up]], which created smaller formations such as the [[Chiricahua Mountains]] in Arizona and deposited massive amounts of volcanic ash and debris over the watershed.<ref>{{cite web

Between 1.8&nbsp;million and 10,000 years ago, massive flows of [[basalt]] from the [[Uinkaret volcanic field]] in northern Arizona dammed the Colorado River within the Grand Canyon.

The first humans of the Colorado River basin were likely [[Paleo-Indian]]s of the [[Clovis culture|Clovis]] and [[Folsom Complex|Folsom]] cultures, who first arrived on the Colorado Plateau about 12,000 years ago. Very little human activity occurred in the watershed until the rise of the [[Desert Archaic Culture]], which from 8,000 to 2,000 years ago constituted most of the region's human population. These prehistoric inhabitants led a generally nomadic lifestyle, gathering plants and hunting small animals (though some of the earliest peoples hunted larger mammals that became extinct in North America after the end of the Pleistocene epoch).<ref name="CP">{{cite web

Beginning in the early centuries A.D., Colorado River basin peoples began to form large agriculture-based societies, some of which lasted hundreds of years and grew into well-organized civilizations encompassing tens of thousands of inhabitants.

These sedentary peoples heavily exploited their surroundings, practicing logging and harvesting of other resources on a large scale. The construction of irrigation canals may have led to a significant change in the morphology of many waterways in the Colorado River basin. Prior to human contact, rivers such as the Gila, Salt and [[Chaco Wash|Chaco]] were shallow perennial streams with low, vegetated banks and large [[floodplain]]s. In time, [[flash flood]]s caused significant downcutting on irrigation canals, which in turn led to the entrenchment of the original streams into [[Arroyo (creek)|arroyos]], making agriculture difficult.<ref name="tenthmil"/> A variety of methods were employed to combat these problems, including the construction of large dams, but when a megadrought hit the region in the 14th&nbsp;century A.D. the ancient civilizations of the Colorado River basin abruptly collapsed.<ref name="tenthmil">{{cite web

Beginning in the 17th&nbsp;century, contact with Europeans brought significant changes to the lifestyles of Native Americans in the Colorado River basin. Missionaries sought to convert indigenous peoples to Christianity, some of which met with success such as [[Eusebio Kino|Father Eusebio Francisco Kino]]'s 1694 encounter with the "docile Pimas of the Gila Valley [who] readily accepted Father Kino and his Christian teachings".<ref name="pima"/> The Spanish introduced sheep and goats to the Navajo, who came to rely heavily on them for meat, milk and wool.<ref name="NavajoUC"/> By the mid-16th&nbsp;century, the Utes, having acquired horses from the Spanish, introduced them to the Colorado River basin. The use of horses spread through the basin via trade between the various tribes and greatly facilitated hunting, communications and travel for indigenous peoples. More warlike groups such as the Utes and Navajos often used the horse to their advantage in raids against tribes that were slower to adopt horses, such as the [[Goshute]]s and [[Southern Paiute]]s.{{sfn|Pritzker|p=309|1998}}

The gradual influx of European and American explorers, fortune seekers and settlers into the region eventually led to conflicts that forced many Native Americans off their traditional lands. After the acquisition of the Colorado River basin from Mexico in the [[Mexican<U+2013>American War]] in 1846, U.S. military forces commanded by [[Kit Carson]] forced more than 8,000 Navajo men, women and children from their homes after a series of unsuccessful attempts to confine their territory <U+2013> many of which were met with violent resistance. In what is now known as the Long Walk of the Navajo, the captives <U+2013> many of whom died along the harsh route <U+2013> were marched from Arizona to [[Fort Sumner]] in New Mexico. Four years later, the Navajo signed a treaty that moved them onto a reservation in the Four Corners region that is today known as the [[Navajo Nation]], the largest Native American reservation in the United States, encompassing {{convert|27000|mi2|km2}} with a population of over 180,000 as of 2000.<ref>{{cite web

Water rights of Native Americans in the Colorado River basin were largely ignored during the extensive water resources development carried out on the river and its tributaries in the 19th and 20th&nbsp;centuries. The construction of dams has often had negative impacts on tribal peoples, such as the Chemehuevi when their riverside lands were flooded after the completion of [[Parker Dam]] in 1938. Ten Native American tribes in the basin now hold, or continue to claim, water rights to the Colorado River.<ref>{{cite web

===Early explorers===
During the 16th&nbsp;century, the Spanish began to explore and colonize western North America. An early motive was the search for the [[Seven Cities of Gold (myth)|Seven Cities of Gold]], or "Cibola", rumored to have been built by Native Americans somewhere in the desert Southwest. In 1536 [[Francisco de Ulloa]], the first documented European to reach the Colorado River, sailed up the Gulf of California and a short distance into the river's delta.<ref>{{cite web

With the guidance of Hopi Indians, C<U+00E1>rdenas and his men became the first outsiders to see the Grand Canyon.{{sfn|Axelrod|Phillips|p=4|2008}} C<U+00E1>rdenas was reportedly unimpressed with the canyon, assuming the width of the Colorado River at {{convert|6|ft|m}} and estimating {{convert|300|ft|m|adj=on}}-tall rock formations to be the size of a man. After unsuccessfully attempting to descend to the river, they left the area, defeated by the difficult terrain and torrid weather.{{sfn|Lankford|pp=100<U+2013>101|2010}}

In 1540, [[Hernando de Alarc<U+00F3>n]] and his fleet reached the mouth of the river, intending to provide additional supplies to Coronado's expedition. Alarc<U+00F3>n may have sailed the Colorado as far upstream as the present-day California<U+2013>Arizona border. Coronado never reached the Gulf of California, and Alarc<U+00F3>n eventually gave up and left.

During the 18th and early 19th&nbsp;centuries, many Americans and Spanish believed in the existence of the [[Buenaventura River (legend)|Buenaventura River]], purported to run from the Rocky Mountains in Utah or Colorado to the Pacific Ocean.{{sfn|Gudde|Bright|p=50|2004}} The name ''Buenaventura'' was given to the Green River by [[Silvestre V<U+00E9>lez de Escalante]] as early as 1776, but Escalante did not know that the Green drained to the Colorado. Many later maps showed the headwaters of the Green and Colorado rivers connecting with the Sevier River (Rio San Ysabel) and [[Utah Lake]] (Lake Timpanogos) before flowing west through the Sierra Nevada into California. Mountain man [[Jedediah Smith]] reached the lower Colorado by way of the Virgin River canyon in 1826. Smith called the Colorado the "Seedskeedee", as the Green River in Wyoming was known to fur trappers, correctly believing it to be a continuation of the Green and not a separate river as others believed under the Buenaventura myth.{{sfn|Dellenbaugh|p=60|1909}} [[John C. Fr<U+00E9>mont]]'s 1843 Great Basin expedition proved that no river traversed the Great Basin and Sierra Nevada, officially debunking the Buenaventura myth.{{sfn|Rolle|p=54|1999}}

[[File:Canyon midday.jpg|thumb|right|alt=View of a steep-sided canyon from river level|Marble Canyon, one of the many gorges that [[Powell Geographic Expedition of 1869|Powell's expedition]] traversed]]
In 1857, Lieutenant [[Joseph Christmas Ives|Joseph C. Ives]] led an expedition to explore the feasibility of using the Colorado River as a navigation route in the Southwest. Ives and his men used a specially built steamboat, the shallow-draft U.S.S. ''Explorer'', and traveled up the river as far as [[Black Canyon of the Colorado|Black Canyon]] on the present Arizona<U+2013>Nevada border. After experiencing numerous groundings and accidents and inhibited by low water in the river, Ives declared: "Ours has been the first, and will doubtless be the last, party of whites to visit this profitless locality. It seems intended by nature that the Colorado River, along the greater portion of its lonely and majestic way, shall be forever unvisited and undisturbed."{{sfn|Dellenbaugh|p=170|1909}}{{sfn|Schmidt|p=12|1993}}

Up until the mid-19th&nbsp;century, long stretches of the Colorado and Green rivers between Wyoming and Nevada remained largely unexplored due to the remote location and dangers of navigating the river. Because of the dramatic drop in elevation of the two rivers, there were rumors of huge waterfalls and violent rapids, and Native American tales strengthened their credibility.{{sfn|Dolnick|2002|p=5}} In 1869, one-armed Civil War veteran [[John Wesley Powell]] led [[Powell Geographic Expedition of 1869|an expedition]] from [[Green River, Wyoming|Green River Station]] in Wyoming, aiming to run the two rivers all the way down to [[St. Thomas, Nevada]], near present-day Hoover Dam.{{sfn|Leuchtenburg|2000|p=360}} Powell and nine men <U+2013> none of whom had prior whitewater experience <U+2013> set out in May. After braving the rapids of the [[Gates of Lodore]], Cataract Canyon and other gorges along the Colorado, the party arrived at the mouth of the Little Colorado River, where Powell noted down arguably the most famous words{{sfn|Dolnick|2002|p=238}} ever written about the Grand Canyon of the Colorado:

{{quote|We are now ready to start on our way down the Great Unknown. Our boats, tied to a common stake, are chafing each other, as they are tossed by the fretful river. They ride high and buoyant, for their loads are lighter than we could desire. We have but a month's rations remaining. The flour has been resifted through the mosquito net sieve; the spoiled bacon has been dried, and the worst of it boiled; the few pounds of dried apples have been spread in the sun, and reshrunken to their normal bulk; the sugar has all melted, and gone on its way down the river; but we have a large sack of coffee. The lighting of the boats has this advantage: they will ride the waves better, and we shall have little to carry when we make a portage.

We are three-quarters of a mile in the depths of the earth, and the great river shrinks into insignificance, as it dashes its angry waves against the walls and cliffs, that rise to the world above; they are but puny ripples, and we but pigmies, running up and down the sands, or lost among the boulders.

We have an unknown distance yet to run; an unknown river yet to explore. What falls there are, we know not; what rocks beset the channel, we know not; what walls rise over the river, we know not; Ah, well! we may conjecture many things. The men talk as cheerfully as ever; jests are bandied about freely this morning; but to me the cheer is somber and the jests are ghastly.|John Wesley Powell's journal, August 1869{{sfn|Dolnick|2002|p=238}}

On August&nbsp;28, 1869, three men deserted the expedition, convinced that they could not possibly survive the trip through the canyon.

Gold strikes from the mid-19th to the early 20th&nbsp;centuries played a major role in attracting settlers to the upper Colorado River basin.

Starting in the latter half of the 19th&nbsp;century, the lower Colorado below Black Canyon became an important waterway for steamboat commerce. In 1852, the ''Uncle Sam'' was launched to provide supplies to the [[U.S. Army]] outpost at [[Fort Yuma]]. Although this vessel struck a sandbar and sank early in its career, commercial traffic quickly proliferated because river transport was much cheaper than hauling freight over land.<ref>{{cite web

====Naming controversy====
Prior to 1921, the upper Colorado above the confluence with the Green River in Utah was not considered part of the main stem. This section of the Colorado had been known as the ''Grand River'' since 1836. In 1921, U.S. Representative [[Edward T. Taylor]] of Colorado petitioned the [[United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce|Congressional Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce]] to rename the Grand River as the Colorado River. Taylor saw the fact that the Colorado River started outside the border of his state as an "abomination".<ref>{{cite news

Meanwhile, large-scale development was also beginning on the opposite end of the Colorado River. In 1900, entrepreneurs of the [[California Development Company]] (CDC) looked to the Imperial Valley of southern California as an excellent location to develop agriculture irrigated by the waters of the river. Engineer [[George Chaffey]] was hired to design the [[Alamo Canal]], which split off from the Colorado River near [[Pilot Knob (Imperial County, California)|Pilot Knob]], curved south into Mexico, and dumped into the [[Alamo River]], a dry arroyo which had historically been observed to carry flood flows of the Colorado into the Salton Sink. With a stable year-round flow in the Alamo River, irrigators in the Imperial Valley were able to begin large-scale farming, and small towns in the region started to expand with the influx of job-seeking migrants.<ref name="Alamocanal">{{cite journal

It was not long before the Colorado River began to wreak havoc with its erratic flows. In autumn, the river would drop below the level of the canal inlet, and temporary brush diversion dams had to be constructed. In early 1905, heavy floods destroyed the headworks of the canal, and water began to flow uncontrolled down the canal towards the Salton Sink. On August 9, the entire flow of the Colorado swerved into the canal and began to flood the bottom of the Imperial Valley. In a desperate gamble to close the breach, crews of the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]], whose tracks ran through the valley, attempted to dam the Colorado above the canal, only to see their work demolished by a flash flood.<ref name="Alamocanal"/> It took seven attempts, more than $3&nbsp;million, and two years for the railroad, the CDC, and the federal government to permanently block the breach and send the Colorado on its natural course to the gulf <U+2013> but not before part of the Imperial Valley was flooded under a {{convert|45|mi|km|adj=mid|-long}} lake, today's Salton Sea. After the immediate flooding threat passed, it was realized that a more permanent solution would be needed to rein in the Colorado.<ref>Patten, McCaskie and Unitt, pp. 4<U+2013>5</ref><ref>{{cite web

In 1922, six U.S. states in the Colorado River basin signed the [[Colorado River Compact]], which divided half of the river's flow to both the Upper Basin (the drainage area above Lee's Ferry, comprising parts of Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming and a small portion of Arizona) and the Lower Basin (Arizona, California, Nevada, and parts of New Mexico and Utah).

Water use had increased significantly by the 1950s, and more water was being diverted out of the Colorado River basin to the Front Range corridor, the [[Salt Lake City]] area in Utah, and the Rio Grande basin in New Mexico.{{sfn|Fradkin|p=191|1996}} Such projects included the Roberts Tunnel, completed in 1956, which diverts {{convert|63000|acre.ft|km3}} per year from the Blue River to the city of Denver,<ref>{{cite web

There was also the concern that drought could impair the upper basin's ability to deliver the required {{convert|7.5|e6acre.ft}} past Lee's Ferry per year as stipulated by the compact. A 1956 act of Congress cleared the way for the USBR's [[Colorado River Storage Project]] (CRSP), which entailed the construction of large dams on the Colorado, Green, Gunnison and San Juan Rivers.<ref>{{cite web

The famed opposition to Glen Canyon Dam, the primary feature of the CRSP, did not build momentum until construction was well underway. This was primarily because of Glen Canyon's remote location and the result that most of the American public did not even know of the existence of the impressive gorge; the few who had, contended that it had much greater scenic value than Echo Park. Sierra Club leader [[David Brower]] fought the dam both during the construction and for many years afterwards until his death in 2000. Brower strongly believed that he was personally responsible for the failure to prevent Glen Canyon's flooding, calling it his "greatest mistake, greatest sin".<ref>{{cite web

Reduced flows have led to increases in the concentration of certain substances in the lower river that have impacted water quality. Salinity is one of the major issues.

More than 1,600 species of plants grow in the Colorado River watershed, ranging from the [[creosote bush]], [[saguaro cactus]], and [[Joshua tree]]s of the Sonoran and Mojave Deserts to the forests of the Rocky Mountains and other uplands, composed mainly of [[ponderosa pine]], [[subalpine fir]], [[Douglas-fir]] and [[Engelmann spruce]].{{sfn|Benke|Cushing|p=488|2005}} Before logging in the 19th&nbsp;century, forests were abundant in high elevations as far south as the Mexico<U+2013>U.S. border, and runoff from these areas nourished abundant grassland communities in river valleys. Some arid regions of the watershed, such as the upper Green River valley in Wyoming, [[Canyonlands National Park]] in Utah and the [[San Pedro River (Arizona)|San Pedro River]] valley in Arizona and Sonora, supported extensive reaches of grassland roamed by large mammals such as [[American bison|buffalo]] and [[pronghorn|antelope]] as late as the 1860s. Near [[Tucson, Arizona]], "where now there is only powder-dry desert, the grass once reached as high as the head of a man on horse back".<ref>{{cite web

Rivers and streams in the Colorado basin were once home to 49 species of native fish, of which 42 were [[endemic species|endemic]]. Engineering projects and river regulation have led to the extinction of four species and severe declines in the populations of 40 species.{{sfn|Benke|Cushing|p=493|2005}} [[Bonytail chub]], [[razorback sucker]], [[Colorado pikeminnow]], and [[humpback chub]] are among those considered the most at risk; all are unique to the Colorado River system and well adapted to the river's natural silty conditions and flow variations. Clear, cold water released by dams has significantly changed characteristics of habitat for these and other Colorado River basin fishes.<ref>{{cite web
