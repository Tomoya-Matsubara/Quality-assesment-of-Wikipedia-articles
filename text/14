'''Hajnal Ban''' (also known as '''Hajnal Black''') is an Australian author, right wing politician and convicted of charges that prevent her being elected to public office for four years.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/hajnal-black-found-guilty/story-e6freoof-1226311101288|title=Hajnal Black fined $5000 after being found guilty of four charges relating to pecuniary interests|last=Baskin|first=Brooke|date=27 March 2012|work=couriermail.com.au|accessdate=20 July 2012}}</ref> She was  elected 15 March 2008 a councillor for [[Logan City]] but was disqualified from 27 March 2012. Previously she was a councillor for the (now defunct) [[Shire of Beaudesert|Beaudesert Shire]] Council from 27 March 2004. She was an unsuccessful [[National Party of Australia|National Party]] candidate for the federal seat of [[Division of Forde|Forde]], south of Brisbane, at the 2007 federal election. She won [[Liberal National Party of Queensland|Liberal National Party]] selection for the newly-created federal seat of [[Division of Wright|Wright]] in November 2009 but subsequently lost endorsement following allegations that she mismanaged the funds of a 65-year-old man.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/hajnal-bans-federal-election-bid-in-doubt-after-funds-allegations/story-e6freoof-1225876663785|title=Hajnal Ban's federal election bid in doubt after funds allegations|last=Sandy|first=Alison|coauthors=Chalmers, Emma|date=7 June 2010|work=couriermail.com.au|accessdate=7 June 2010}}</ref> She had meantime openly acknowledged that she was backed by the Australian TEA Party (and [[English Defence League|Australian Defence League]], ADL, group) with David Goodridge<ref>Massola, James 16 September 2010, "Tea Party comes to Australia" http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/capital-circle/tea-party-comes-to-australia/story-fn59nqgy-1225924785030</ref>

In 2002 she underwent surgery to increase the length of each leg by 8&nbsp;cm. She published her experiences in the book ''God Made Me Small, Surgery Made Me Tall'' under the [[pseudonym]] Sara Vornamen. She also released a book called ''Her Secret''.<ref>http://www.borders.com.au/book/hajnal-ban-her-secret/7452437/</ref><ref>http://www.hajnalban.com/node/22</ref>

== Early life ==
Hajnal Ban was born in [[Afula]], [[Israel]], to [[Hungary|Hungarian]] parents.<ref>Vornamen, Sara (Hajnal Ban's pen name)(2003) ''God made small, surgery made me tall''. Vornamen Enterprises</ref> Ban's grandfather was an Eastern European [[Judaism|Jewish]] [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] survivor who moved the family to Israel in 1976 to escape communism.<ref name="Laszlo">Laszlo, Dr Tanka (editor) (2005) ''Ausztralia es Uj-Zealand Magyar Vilaga (in English - Hungarians in the Australian and New Zealand part of the world)''. Panarama Konyvek (in English - Panarama Books), pg 34 article titled ''Ban, Hajnal - Kepviselo, jogasz (in English political/representative)'' and ''Szeret masokon segiteni (in English - She likes to help others)''.  This is a Hungarian written A-Z of ''notable'' Hungarians from around the world.  This edition is for the Australia/New Zealand region</ref>  The family moved to [[Austria]] in 1980 and then immigrated to [[Logan City]], south of [[Brisbane]], [[Australia]] in 1983.  On gaining pre-selection for a Federal seat, Ban relinquished her Israeli citizenship as [[Section 44 of the Australian Constitution]] forbids the election of people holding dual citizenship to its parliament.

== Education ==
Ban was educated at [[Marsden, Queensland|Marsden]] Primary School and then [[Marsden State High School]] in [[Logan City]], graduating in 1995. After high school she entered [[Griffith University|Griffith University's]] [[Griffith Law School|law school]] and completed a double degree in Law and International Business. Ban was then admitted as a Barrister-at-Law in 2001.<ref name="Laszlo"/>

== Leg lengthening surgery ==
In 2002 Ban undertook radical cosmetic surgery to gain 8&nbsp;cm of height. She travelled to the [[Russian Ilizarov Scientific Center for Restorative Traumatology and Orthopaedics]] in [[Kurgan, Kurgan Oblast|Kurgan]], Russia where she was operated on by Dr Constantine Novikov.<ref>Vornamen, Sara (Hajnal Ban's pen name)(2003) ''God made small, surgery made me tall''. Vornamen Enterprises, pg 19</ref><ref>[[Who (magazine)|Who]] (18 May 2009) ''Extreme measures''. Pacific Magazines, pg 24</ref>
 
Over a period of 5 months Ban was bedridden as her legs were lengthened. The process of lengthening took 12 months.  She returned to Australia and talked to the media about her operation under the pseudonym Sara Vornamen in an attempt to hide her identity.  Under the name 'Sara Vornamen' Hajnal Ban wrote a book about her surgery, ''God made me small, Surgery made me Tall''.<ref name="Calligeros -1">{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/big-op-overcomes-small-anxiety-siberian-surgeons-add-8cms-20090429-amfy.html?page=-1|title=Big op overcomes small anxiety: Siberian surgeons add 8cms|last=Calligeros|first=Marissa  |date=29 April 2009|work=Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=2009-05-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/World/Mad-Mad-World/God-made-me-small-surgery-made-me-tall/articleshow/4467545.cms|title=God made me small, surgery made me tall|date=30 April 2009|work=Times of India|accessdate=2009-05-25}}</ref>

Brisbane's [[The Courier-Mail|Courier-Mail]] revealed in April 2009 that Ban was actually Sara Vornamen.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/story/0,,25399893-23272,00.html|title=Hajnal Ban has legs broken to be 8cm taller|last=Sandy|first=Alison|date=29 April 2009|work=The Courier-Mail|accessdate=2009-05-25}}</ref>  Since that time Ban has received world wide attention for her surgery<ref>{{cite news|url=http://women.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/women/article6196646.ece|title=Australian councillor, Hajnal Ban, has legs broken to become taller|last=Tedmanson|first=Sophie|date=1 May 2009|work=Times Online|accessdate=2009-05-31 | location=London}}</ref> and has been a commentator on issues from sex-discrimination to extra airline charges.<ref>Robertson, Josh (23 May 2009) ''Giving hot girls a leg up''. The Courier Mail, pg 72</ref>

==Personal life== 

Ban made no secret of her relationship with Russell Tacon.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.couriermail.com.au/entertainment/celebrity/hajnal-ban-says-she-owes-it-all-to-mentor-russell-tacon/story-e6freq7o-1225875670155|title=Hajnal Ban says she owes it all to mentor Russell Tacon|date=4 June 2010|work=The Courier Mail|accessdate=2010-08-03}}</ref>

Ban married Logan City Councillor [[Sean Black]] at [[Tamborine Mountain]] on 30 May 2010.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/hajnal-ban-sean-black-marry-in-mt-tambourine-ceremony/story-e6freoof-1225873200589|title=Hajnal Ban, Sean Black marry in Mt Tamborine ceremony|last=Sandy|first=Alison|date=30 May 2010|work=The Courier-Mail|accessdate=2010-06-01}}</ref> Black has acted as her campaign manager. She was known as '''Hajnal Black''' until they separated in mid 2012.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/former-logan-city-councillor-hajnal-ban-back-in-court-to-defend-spend/story-e6freon6-1226430687949|title=Former Logan City councillor Hajnal Ban back in court to defend spend|publisher=Courier-Mail|date=20 July 2012}}</ref>

== Political career ==
=== 2004 - 2008, Shire of Beaudesert Council ===

Hajnal Ban was first elected as Councillor for Division 4 in the former Shire of Beaudesert on 27 March 2004 at the age of 26 where she significantly outpolled her four male opponents.<ref>Flack, Mark (26 October 2007). ''Ban believes people contact is key to electoral success''. Albert and Logan News, p. 14</ref>  She was the youngest ever councillor to be elected in the shire and the only Barrister. She was elected to council as an independent and had no previous political party affiliation.  She joined the National Party in 2006.   

She was Chairperson of the Shire's Planning and Development Committee from April 2004, until December 2005 when she was removed from the post, a move spearheaded by Councillor John Fronis, over her opposition to the State's decision to designate the North McLean Enterprise Precinct in the [[South East Queensland]] Regional Plan, which would have placed heavy industry in the middle of her rural residential division.<ref>Waters, Brenton (12 December 2005) ''Ban-ished!''. Jimboomba Times, pg 5</ref>

=== 2007 Federal election ===

In the November 2007 [[Australian federal election, 2007|Federal Election]] Ban stood as the National Party candidate for the seat of Forde.<ref>Jacobson, Micheal (10<U+2013>11 November 2007) "Long-standing MPs to sit out". Weekend Bulletin, pg 58</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/happy-national-breaks-the-mould/2006/10/25/1161749190650.html|title=Happy National breaks the mould|last=Coorey|first=Phillip  |date=26 October 2006|work=Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=2009-06-01}}</ref>   Although she worked hard at her campaign<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,22794635-5006786,00.html|title=Libs lose faith and turn to Nats|last=McKenna|first=Michael|date=21 November 2007|work=The Australian|accessdate=2009-05-31}}</ref> and was credited with achieving a larger than expected swing, Ban only achieved 12.2% of the primary vote.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://results.aec.gov.au/13745/Website/HouseDivisionFirstPrefs-13745-162.htm|title=House of Representatives - Forde (2007 general election)|date=11 December 2007|publisher=[[Australian Electoral Commission]]|accessdate=2009-05-31}}</ref>  The Forde electorate's voter base is heavily urban, so it was always unlikely the electorate would have voted for a National Party candidate over their urban Conservative sister party, the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberals]].

=== 2008 Local Government Elections ===

In July 2007, the Queensland [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] [[Government of Queensland|Government]] announced widespread [[Local Government Reform Commission|reform to local government]].  The major reform was to amalgamate many councils, and Beaudesert was included in the process.  Half of the Shire was amalgamated with the [[Shire of Boonah]] to create the [[Scenic Rim Region]] while the other half was amalgamated with Logan City.  Hajnal Ban's entire division was in the transferring area to be amalgamated into Logan City.  Her division underwent significant change as it was merged with the neighbouring Division 5 (held by John Fronis, a Labor councillor) to form the new Logan City Division 11. Fronis and Ban subsequently contested the new division at the March 2008 elections, with Ban winning convincingly, even in areas where the Labor vote at state and federal elections has historically been high. Ban achieved 66.06% of the two-candidate-preferred vote to John Fronis' 33.94%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ecq.qld.gov.au/elections/local/lg2008/LoganCity/results/councillor/booth11.html|title=2008 Logan City - Councillor Election - Division 11|date=7 April 2008|publisher=Electoral Commission of Queensland|accessdate=2009-05-31}}</ref>

=== Post 2008 election ===
After her election to Logan City Hajnal Ban was elected Chairperson of the Community, Sport and Customer Services Committee but was removed from this position in May 2009 and replaced by a neighbouring urban based councillor, Phil Pidgeon, because of her strong and somewhat outspoken advocacy for the amalgamated areas she represents.<ref>Fraser, Kelmeny (24 May 2009) ''Council bars rebels''.  The Sunday Mail, pg 39</ref>

Ban formed an alliance with the only other Logan City rural councillor, Sean Black, in late 2008. Together they formed a strong allegiance in council advocating and representing their similar constituencies. Ban and Black married in 2010.

=== 2010 LNP candidacy for Wright ===
After questions were raised by Queensland<U+2019>s Adult Guardian about her administration of an elderly man<U+2019>s [[Estate (law)|estate]], the Liberal National Party revoked their endorsement of Ban as their candidate for the federal division of Wright on 7 June 2010.<ref>{{cite web|last=Maizey|first=Judith|title=Hajnal Ban dropped by LNP|url=http://albert-and-logan.whereilive.com.au/news/story/hajnal-ban-dropped-by-lnp/|accessdate=8 July 2010}}</ref> The LNP claim the Adult Guardian<U+2019>s questions were never disclosed in her vetting committee. Ban voluntarily surrendered her Power of Attorney on 2 July 2010 after which proceedings in the [[Queensland Civil and Administrative Tribunal]] (QCAT) were ceased.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/politics/state-politics/ban-attacks-lnp-over-guardian-case/story-e6frgczx-1225888235879|title=Ban attacks LNP over guardian case|last=Barrett|first=Rosanne|date=6 July 2010|publisher = [[The Australian]]|accessdate=6 July 2010}}</ref>

Ban hit out at the Liberal National Party for taking pre-emptive action against her despite tribunal matters being settled within a month.{{citation needed|date=July 2010}} She went on to say men in the LNP hierarchy were never comfortable with a woman being preselected in a winnable seat.<ref>Fraser, Kelmeny (4 July 2010). "Dumped for being a woman, says Hajnal". ''The Sunday Mail'' (News Ltd), p. 10</ref> She had meantime openly acknowledged that she was backed by the Australian TEA Party (and Australian Defence League, ADL, group) with David Goodridge<ref>Massola, James 16 September 2010, "Tea Party comes to Australia" http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/capital-circle/tea-party-comes-to-australia/story-fn59nqgy-1225924785030</ref>

2012 Logan Council Election

Hajnal originally nominated to run again as councillor for Division 11, but several weeks prior to the election she withdrew from the contest.
As of the 28th of April 2012, she is unemployed and most likely, completely unemployable, due to the criminal convictions she has accrued over the course of 2012.

=== Policies on Gaming Machines ===

Hajnal Ban is an anti-[[Slot machine|pokies]] campaigner and continues to advocate for the reduction in the number of gaming machines within the Logan City local government area.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://logan-west-leader.whereilive.com.au/news/story/ban-moves-on-greenbank-tavern-pokie-plan/|last=Maizey|first=Judith|title=Ban moves on Greenbank Tavern pokie plan|date=16 June 2009|work=Albert & Logan News|accessdate=2009-06-16}}</ref> Ban voted prominently in several ballots to remove Deputy Mayor of Logan, Russell Lutton, who is a pro-pokies councillor.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/queensland/lions-slot-new-venue-into-queenslands-poker-machine-capital-20090429-anaq.html|last=Barrett|first=Chris|title=Lions slot new venue into Queensland's poker machine capital|date=29 April 2009|work=Brisbanetimes.com.au|accessdate=2010-03-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://albert-and-logan.whereilive.com.au/news/story/council-out-on-a-limb/|last=Helbig|first=Koren|title=Council out on limb|date=1 May 2009|work=Albert & Logan News|accessdate=2009-06-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.logan.qld.gov.au/LCC/logan/news/Current/N090316decisionisaboutgivingresidents.htm|last=Lutton|first=Russell|title=Decision is about giving residents a choice|date=16 March 2009|work=Logan City press release obtained from LCC website|accessdate=2010-02-03}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/story/0,23739,25138847-952,00.html|last=Davies|first=Hannah|title=Logan City moves to ban poker machines|date=4 March 2009|work=Courier Mail|accessdate=2010-02-03}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>  Lutton has since fought back criticising Ban, including references to her leg lengthening story.<ref name="Calligeros -1"/><ref>Robertson, Josh (5 May 2009) ''Tall tales at Logan circus''. The Courier-Mail, pg 38</ref>

=== Criminal charges ===
{{update|Criminal charges|date=July 2012}} 
In November 2011, Black faced criminal charges for allegedly breaching local government financial disclosure laws. In December 2011, a Brisbane judge found that she had failed to act properly on behalf of a dementia patient after the sale of his Park Ridge property south of Brisbane. The funds from the sale had been transferred into her own bank account instead of being held in a separate trust account.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-12-07/court-rules-against-councillor-in-2413m-dispute/3718778|title=Court rules against councillor in $1.3m dispute|publisher=ABC Online|date=7 December 2011}}</ref> Black lodged an appeal against the decision of the Supreme court in January 2012, the case has yet to be set down for mention.  She has had two warrants issued for her arrest in March 2012, for ignoring a court date and storming out of another. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/hajnal-black-diagnosed-with-laryngitis-as-warrant-for-her-arrest-remains-active/story-e6freoof-1226304034309|title=Hajnal Black on move to Brisbane Court of Appeal as warrant for her arrest remains active|publisher=Courier Mail|date=19 March 2012}}</ref> On 27 March 2012 she was found guilty on four of the five charges, fined $3500 and ordered to pay costs of $5000 and had a conviction recorded.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/hajnal-black-found-guilty/story-e6freoof-1226311101288|title=Hajnal Black found guilty|publisher=Courier Mail|date=27 March 2012}}</ref> Black has 28 days to appeal that verdict. {{update after|2012|7|20}}
