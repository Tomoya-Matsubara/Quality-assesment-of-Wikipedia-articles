'''Allan Louis Benson''' (1871<U+2013>1940) was an [[United States|American]] newspaper editor and author who ran for [[President of the United States|President]] as the [[Socialist Party of America]] candidate in [[United States presidential election, 1916|1916]].

==Biography==
===Early years===

Benson was born in [[Plainfield Township, Kent County, Michigan|Plainfield]], [[Michigan]] on November 6, 1871. His father, Adelbert L. Benson, was a factory worker during Allan's boyhood, later becoming a [[miller]], while his mother, Rose Morris Benson, died when Allan was an infant.<ref name="MiSoc">"Biographical Sketch of Allan L. Benson," ''The Michigan Socialist,'' no. 11 (September 22, 1916), pg. 1.</ref> Allan lived until he was 12 with his grandfather, a farmer in [[Silver Creek, Michigan]].<ref name="MiSoc" />

At the age of 15, Benson's father's mill burned and he was forced to give up his aspiration of attending college and becoming a lawyer.<ref name="MiSoc" /> Benson left home and took a job in a chair factory, later working in a paper mill.<ref name="MiSoc" />

Benson only attended one year of high school, but he nevertheless took the state examination to become a school teacher and passed, earning a certificate to teach in a district school.<ref name="MiSoc" /> He became involved in a physical conflict with some farm boys in the first school to which he was assigned and was apparently forced to resign his post.<ref name="MiSoc" />

In April 1891, Benson left [[Otsego, Michigan]] for Detroit, where he went to work for the Peninsular Car Company as a machine hand.<ref name="MiSoc" /> He began to regularly visit the offices of the various Detroit newspapers in search of a position and was finally hired as a reporter, earning the starvation wage of $6 a week.<ref name="MiSoc" />

Benson moved to [[Ann Arbor]] in the fall of 1891 to assume the position of managing editor of the ''Washetaw Daily Times.''<ref name="MiSoc" /> He continued to move up the ranks of the newspaper profession, moving to a position as telegraph editor of the ''Chicago Inter-Ocean'' in the spring of 1892.<ref name="MiSoc" /> He later worked as telegraph editor of the ''[[Salt Lake Tribune]]'' and as a writer in San Francisco.<ref name="MiSoc" />

Benson subsequently worked as managing editor of the ''[[Detroit Journal]]'', the ''[[Detroit Times]]'', and the ''[[Washington Times]]''.  He married [[Mary Hugh]] in [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]], [[Ontario]] on November 19, 1899 and had four children.

===Political career===

In 1916, after [[Eugene V. Debs]] declined the [[Socialist Party of America|Socialist Party's]] nomination for the Presidential candidacy, Benson was nominated by a direct mail vote of party members. Benson received 590,524 votes for 3.2% of the total vote.<ref>[http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/national.php?year=1916&minper=0&f=1&off=0&elect=0 1916 Presidential Election Results], US Election Atlas.org Retrieved July 4, 2010.</ref> Benson was an anti-war voice in the years leading up to [[World War I]]; one of the planks of his Presidential campaign platform was that war should be only entered into by national referendum.  However, when the Socialist Party issued a manifesto placing equal blame on Germany and the allies, he resigned from the party.

[[File:Reconstruction-June1920.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Cover of the June 1920 issue of Benson's magazine, ''Reconstruction.'']]
From January 1919 through June 1921, Benson was the publisher of a new monthly magazine called ''Reconstruction,'' subtitled "A Herald of the New Time." The publication used a newsprint format similar to ''[[The Nation]]'' and ''[[The New Republic]]'' and advanced a [[liberalism|liberal]] political line slightly to the right of those journals. Frequent contributors included former Socialists [[Charles Edward Russell]] and [[Max S. Hayes]]. A substantial run of the publication is present in the collection of the [[New York Public Library]].<ref>[http://catalog.nypl.org/record=b15424979~S1 ''Reconstruction: A Herald of the New Time.''] New York Public Library catalog, nypl.org/</ref>

===Later years, death, and legacy===

Benson's later years were spent housebound in [[Yonkers, New York]]. Several months before his death, Benson wrote a letter to cartoonist [[Art Young]] explaining his plight:

<blockquote>
"I am suffering not from pernicious [[anemia]] but from the injury to my nervous system that this disease did when four dumbbell doctors (who were supposed to be good) did not recognize it for what it was and let it go until I collapsed, was in bed for six months and have scarcely been able to walk across the room ever since. I have been away from the house but seven times in nine years, for an hour's motor trip each time, and have not now been out in almost two years. I am in more or less distress all the time, but I read almost constantly and thus enjoy myself pretty well considering the circumstances."<ref>Allan S. Benson in Yonkers, New York to Art Young in Bethel, Connecticut, May 31, 1940. Art Young Papers, University of Michigan Special Collections, box 1, folder "Correspondence (1940-1941)."</ref></blockquote>

Benson died in Yonkers, [[New York]], on August 19, 1940.
