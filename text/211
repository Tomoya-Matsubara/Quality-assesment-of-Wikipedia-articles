==Early life==
Buffett was born in 1930 in [[Omaha, Nebraska]], the second of three children and only son of businessman and politician [[Howard Buffett]],<ref>{{cite news|last=Blair |first=Elliot |url=http://www.usatoday.com/money/2004-01-29-nebraska_x.htm |title=Nebraska family clashes over love, money and death |work=USA Today  |date=January 29, 2004 |accessdate=May 23, 2010}}</ref> and his wife Leila (n<U+00E9>e Stahl). Buffett began his education at Rose Hill Elementary School in Omaha. In 1942, his father was elected to the first of four terms in the [[United States Congress]], and after moving with his family to Washington, D.C., Warren finished elementary school, attended Alice Deal Junior High School, and graduated from [[Woodrow Wilson High School (Washington, DC)|Woodrow Wilson High School]] in 1947, where his senior yearbook picture reads: "likes math; a future stock broker."<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=May 20, 2008|url=http://www.nti.org/b_aboutnti/b1t.html|title=Warren E. Buffett|publisher=[[Nuclear Threat Initiative]]}}</ref>

Even as a child, Buffett displayed an interest in making and saving money. He went door to door selling chewing gum, [[Coca-Cola]], or weekly magazines. For a while, he worked in his grandfather's grocery store. While still in high school he was successful in making money by delivering newspapers, selling golfballs and stamps, and detailing cars, among other means. Filing his first income [[Tax return (United States)|tax return]] in 1944, Buffett took a $35 deduction for the use of his bicycle and watch on his paper route.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7280569.stm|title=Buffett 'becomes world's richest'|accessdate=May 20, 2008|publisher=BBC  | date=March 6, 2008}}</ref> In 1945, in his sophomore year of high school, Buffett and a friend spent $25 to purchase a used [[pinball]] machine, which they placed in the local [[barber|barber shop]]. Within months, they owned several machines in different barber shops.

Buffett's interest in the stock market and investing also dated to his childhood, to the days he spent in the customers' lounge of a regional [[stock brokerage]] near the office of his father's own brokerage company. On a trip to New York City at the age of ten, he made a point to visit the [[New York Stock Exchange]]. At the age of 11, he bought three shares of [[Cities Service]] Preferred for himself, and three for his sister.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fool.com/specials/1999/sp990429Berkshire002.htm |title=Special Feature, April&nbsp;29, 1999: Berkshire and Buffett |publisher=Fool.com |accessdate=November 28, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite book| url=http://books.google.com/?id=OOZWykmT-KUC&pg=PA26&lpg=PA26&dq=buffett+city+services+preferred#v=onepage&q=buffett%20city%20services%20preferred&f=false| title=Warren Buffett wealth: principles and practical methods used by the world's greatest investor| author=Robert P.

By the time he finished college, Buffett had accumulated more than $90,000 in savings measured in 2009 dollars.

Buffett entered college as a freshmen in 1947 at the [[Wharton Business School]] of the [[University of Pennsylvania]] and studied there for two years from 1947 to 1949. In the year 1950, when he entered his junior year, he transferred to the [[University of Nebraska<U+2013>Lincoln]] where at the age of nineteen, he graduated with a degree of Bachelor of Science in Business Administration. After the completion of his undergraduate studies, Buffett enrolled at [[Columbia Business School]] after learning that [[Benjamin Graham]] (author of "[[The Intelligent Investor]]" <U+2013> one of his favorite books on investing) and [[David Dodd]], two well-known [[securities analyst]]s, taught there. He received a M.S. in Economics from [[Columbia Business School]] in 1951. Buffett also attended the [[New York Institute of Finance]]. In Buffett<U+2019>s own words: {{cquote|I<U+2019>m 15 percent [[Philip Arthur Fisher|Fisher]] and 85 percent [[Benjamin Graham]].<ref>{{harvnb|Hagstrom|2005|p= 27}}</ref></p><p>The basic ideas of investing are to look at stocks as business, use the market's fluctuations to your advantage, and seek a [[Margin of safety (financial)|margin of safety]].

==Career==
{{See also|List of assets owned by Berkshire Hathaway}}

Warren Buffett was employed from 1951<U+2013>54 at ''Buffett-Falk & Co.'', [[Omaha, Nebraska|Omaha]] as an investment salesman, from 1954<U+2013>1956 at ''Graham-Newman Corp.'', New York as a securities analyst, from 1956<U+2013>1969 at ''Buffett Partnership, Ltd.'', Omaha as a general partner and from 1970&nbsp;<U+2013> Present at [[Berkshire Hathaway|Berkshire Hathaway Inc]], Omaha as its [[Chair (official)|Chairman]], CEO.

In 1950, at the age of 20, Buffett had made and saved $9,800. In April 1952, Buffett discovered [[Benjamin Graham|Graham]] was on the board of [[GEICO]] insurance. Taking a train to Washington, D.C. on a Saturday, he knocked on the door of GEICO's headquarters until a janitor allowed him in. There he met Lorimer Davidson, Geico's Vice President, and the two discussed the insurance business for hours. Davidson would eventually become Buffett's life-long friend and a lasting influence<ref>{{cite book|author=Lowenstein, Roger|title=Buffett: The Making of an American Capitalist|page=43|isbn=0385484917}}</ref> and later recall that he found Buffett to be an "extraordinary man" after only fifteen minutes. Buffett graduated from Columbia and wanted to work on [[Wall Street]], however, both his father and Ben Graham urged him not to. He offered to work for Graham for free, but Graham refused.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.intelligentinvestorclub.com/downloads/Warren-Buffett-Florida-Speech.pdf |title=Lecture at the University of Florida School of Business <U+2013> Transcript (PDF document) |publisher=Intelligent Investor |date=October 15, 1998|accessdate=May 7, 2010}}</ref>

Buffett returned to Omaha and worked as a stockbroker while taking a [[Dale Carnegie]] public speaking course.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} Using what he learned, he felt confident enough to teach an "Investment Principles" night class at the [[University of Nebraska-Omaha]]. The average age of his students was more than twice his own. During this time he also purchased a Sinclair Texaco gas station as a side investment. However, this did not turn out to be a successful business venture.

 }}</ref> Buffett married [[Susan Buffett|Susan Thompson]] at Dundee Presbyterian Church and the next year they had their first child, [[Susan Alice Buffett]]. In 1954, Buffett accepted a job at [[Benjamin Graham]]'s partnership. His starting salary was $12,000 a year (approximately $97,000 adjusted to 2008 dollars). There he worked closely with [[Walter Schloss]]. Graham was a tough man to work for. He was adamant that stocks provide a wide margin of safety after weighting the trade-off between their price and their intrinsic value. The argument made sense to Buffett but he questioned whether the criteria were too stringent and caused the company to miss out on big winners that had more qualitative values.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} That same year the Buffetts had their second child, [[Howard Graham Buffett]]. In 1956, [[Benjamin Graham]] retired and closed his partnership. At this time Buffett's personal savings were over $174,000 ($1.2&nbsp;million inflation adjusted to 2009 dollars) and he started Buffett Partnership Ltd., an investment partnership in Omaha.

[[File:Dundee HD Omaha NE.JPG|thumb|Buffett's home in Omaha]]
In 1957, Buffett had three partnerships operating the entire year. He purchased a five-bedroom stucco house in [[Omaha, Nebraska|Omaha]], where he still lives, for $31,500. In 1958 the Buffett's third child, [[Peter Andrew Buffett]], was born. Buffett operated five partnerships the entire year. In 1959, the company grew to six partnerships operating the entire year and Buffett was introduced to [[Charlie Munger]]. By 1960, Buffett had seven partnerships operating: Buffett Associates, Buffett Fund, Dacee, Emdee, Glenoff, Mo-Buff and Underwood. He asked one of his partners, a doctor, to find ten other doctors willing to invest $10,000 each in his partnership. Eventually eleven agreed, and Buffett pooled their money with a mere $100 original investment of his own. In 1961, Buffett revealed that Sanborn Map Company accounted for 35% of the partnership's assets. He explained that in 1958 Sanborn stock sold at only $45 per share when the value of the Sanborn investment portfolio was $65 per share. This meant that buyers valued Sanborn stock at "minus $20" per share and were unwilling to pay more than 70 cents on the dollar for an investment portfolio with a map business thrown in for nothing. This earned him a spot on the board of Sanborn.

===As a millionaire===
In 1962, Buffett became a millionaire, because of his partnerships, which in January 1962 had an excess of $7,178,500, of which over $1,025,000 belonged to Buffett. Buffett merged all partnerships into one partnership. Buffett invested in and eventually took control of a textile manufacturing firm, Berkshire Hathaway. Buffett's partnerships began purchasing shares at $7.60 per share. In 1965, when Buffett's partnerships began purchasing Berkshire aggressively, they paid $14.86 per share while the company had [[working capital]] of $19 per share. This did not include the value of fixed assets (factory and equipment). Buffett took control of Berkshire Hathaway at the board meeting and named a new president, Ken Chace, to run the company. In 1966, Buffett closed the partnership to new money. Buffett wrote in his letter: "... unless it appears that circumstances have changed (under some conditions added capital would improve results) or unless new partners can bring some asset to the partnership other than simply capital, I intend to admit no additional partners to BPL."

In a second letter, Buffett announced his first investment in a private business&nbsp;<U+2014> Hochschild, Kohn and Co, a privately owned Baltimore department store. In 1967, Berkshire paid out its first and only dividend of 10 cents. In 1969, following his most successful year, Buffett liquidated the partnership and transferred their assets to his partners. Among the assets paid out were shares of Berkshire Hathaway. In 1970, as chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, Buffett began writing his now-famous annual letters to shareholders. However, he lived solely on his salary of $50,000 per year, and his outside investment income. In 1979, Berkshire began the year trading at $775 per share, and ended at $1,310. Buffett's net worth reached $620&nbsp;million, placing him on the [[Forbes 400]] for the first time.

In 1973, Berkshire began to acquire stock in the [[Washington Post Company]]. Buffett became close friends with [[Katharine Graham]], who controlled the company and its flagship newspaper, and became a member of its board of directors. In 1974, the SEC opened a formal investigation into Warren Buffett and Berkshire's acquisition of WESCO, due to possible conflict of interest. No charges were brought. In 1977, Berkshire indirectly purchased the ''Buffalo Evening News'' for $32.5&nbsp;million. Antitrust charges started, instigated by its rival, the ''Buffalo Courier-Express''. Both papers lost money, until the ''Courier-Express'' folded in 1982.

In 1979, Berkshire began to acquire stock in ABC. Capital Cities announced $3.5&nbsp;billion purchase of ABC on March 18, 1985 surprised the media industry, as ABC was four times bigger than Capital Cities at the time. [[Berkshire Hathaway]] chairman Warren Buffett helped finance the deal in return for a 25% stake in the combined company.<ref>Kleinfield, N.R. "ABC is being sold for $3.5&nbsp;billion; 1st network sale". ''The New York Times'', March 19, 1985.</ref> The newly merged company, known as Capital Cities/ABC (or CapCities/ABC), was forced to sell off some stations due to FCC ownership rules. Also, the two companies owned several radio stations in the same markets.<ref>"FCC approval of Capcities/ABC deal likely". ''[[Broadcasting & Cable|Broadcasting]]'', March 25, 1985.</ref>

In 1987, Berkshire Hathaway purchased a 12% stake in Salomon Inc., making it the largest shareholder and Buffett the director. In 1990, a scandal involving [[John Gutfreund]] (former CEO of [[Salomon Brothers]]) surfaced. A [[rogue trader]], [[Paul Mozer]], was submitting bids in excess of what was allowed by the Treasury rules. When this was discovered and brought to the attention of Gutfreund, he did not immediately suspend the rogue trader. Gutfreund left the company in August 1991.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mbaa.fuqua.duke.edu/ldi/press_johngutfreund.html |title='&#39;Inaction Can be as Dangerous as Bad Action'&#39;, Aly Gonenne, Class of 2004, Duke Leadership Development Initiative |publisher=Mbaa.fuqua.duke.edu |accessdate=May 23, 2010}}</ref> Buffett became Chairman of Salomon until the crisis passed; on September 4, 1991, he testified before Congress.<ref>[http://www.c-spanarchives.org/library/index.php?main_page=product_video_info&products_id=21029-1]</ref> In 1988, Buffett began buying stock in [[Coca-Cola Company]], eventually purchasing up to 7% of the company for $1.02&nbsp;billion. It would turn out to be one of Berkshire's most lucrative investments, and one which it still holds.

===As a billionaire===
Buffett became a billionaire on paper when Berkshire Hathaway began selling class A shares on May 29, 1990, when the market closed at $7,175 a share.<ref>{{cite web |accessdate=May 23, 2010 |url=http://www.google.com/finance/historical?cid=4376&startdate=May+29%2C+1990&enddate=Jun+29%2C+1990 |title=Berkshire Hathaway Inc. historical prices |publisher=Google Finance }}</ref> In 1998, in an unusual move, he acquired [[General Re]] (Gen Re) for stock. In 2002, Buffett became involved with [[Maurice R. Greenberg]] at [[AIG]], with General Re providing [[reinsurance]]. On March 15, 2005, AIG's board forced Greenberg to resign from his post as Chairman and CEO under the shadow of criticism from [[Eliot Spitzer]], former attorney general of the state of New York. On February 9, 2006, AIG and the New York State Attorney General's office agreed to a settlement in which AIG would pay a fine of $1.6&nbsp;billion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sec.gov/news/press/2006-19.htm |title=AIG to Pay $800&nbsp;Million to Settle Securities Fraud Charges by SEC; Over $1.6&nbsp;billion to be Paid to Resolve Federal and New York State Actions |date=February 9, 2006 |publisher=[[Securities and Exchange Commission]] }}</ref> In 2010, the federal government settled with Berkshire Hathaway for $92&nbsp;million in return for the firm avoiding prosecution in an AIG fraud scheme, and undergoing 'corporate governance concessions'.<ref>[http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704320104575015131135869288.html GenRe Reaches Deal With Justice Department in AIG Case ] By AMIR EFRATI , 2010 Jan 21, Wall Street Journal</ref>

In 2002, Buffett entered in $11&nbsp;billion worth of [[forward contract]]s to deliver U.S. dollars against other currencies. By April 2006, his total gain on these contracts was over $2&nbsp;billion. In 2006, Buffett announced in June that he gradually would give away 85% of his Berkshire holdings to five foundations in annual gifts of stock, starting in July 2006. The largest contribution would go to the [[Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]].<ref>{{cite journal|first=Carol J.|last=Loomis|title=Warren Buffett gives away his fortune|journal=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]|date=June 25, 2006|ref=harv}}</ref> In 2007, in a letter to shareholders, Buffett announced that he was looking for a younger successor, or perhaps successors, to run his investment business.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=May 20, 2008|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Business/story?id=2916457&page=1|title=HELP WANTED: Warren Buffett Replacement|publisher=[[ABC News]]}}</ref> Buffett had previously selected Lou Simpson, who runs investments at [[Geico]], to fill that role.

In addition to suggestions of mistiming, questions have been raised as to the wisdom in keeping some of Berkshire's major holdings, including The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) which in 1998 peaked at $86.

===Philanthropy===
The following quotation from 1988 highlights Warren Buffett's thoughts on his wealth and why he long planned to re-allocate it:

{{cquote|I don't have a problem with guilt about money. The way I see it is that my money represents an enormous number of claim checks on society. It's like I have these little pieces of paper that I can turn into consumption. If I wanted to, I could hire 10,000 people to do nothing but paint my picture every day for the rest of my life. And the GDP would go up. But the utility of the product would be zilch, and I would be keeping those 10,000 people from doing AIDS research, or teaching, or nursing. I don't do that though. I don't use very many of those claim checks. There's nothing material I want very much. And I'm going to give virtually all of those claim checks to charity when my wife and I die. (Lowe 1997:165<U+2013>166)}}

From a ''NY Times'' article: "I don't believe in dynastic wealth", Warren Buffett said, calling those who grow up in wealthy circumstances "members of the lucky sperm club".<ref>NY Times article should go here <!-- but not from a blog that copied it without permission! --></ref> Buffett has written several times of his belief that, in a market economy, the rich earn outsized rewards for their talents: {{cquote|A market economy creates some lopsided payoffs to participants. The right endowment of vocal chords, anatomical structure, physical strength, or mental powers can produce enormous piles of claim checks (stocks, bonds, and other forms of capital) on future national output. Proper selection of ancestors similarly can result in lifetime supplies of such tickets upon birth. If zero real investment returns diverted a bit greater portion of the national output from such stockholders to equally worthy and hardworking citizens lacking jackpot-producing talents, it would seem unlikely to pose such an insult to an equitable world as to risk Divine Intervention.<ref>"How Inflation Swindles the Equity Investor", Warren E. Buffett, ''Fortune'' May 1977 #</ref>}}

His children will not inherit a significant proportion of his wealth. This is consistent with statements he has made in the past indicating his opposition to the transfer of great fortunes from one generation to the next.<ref>"[http://www.economist.com/books/displaystory.cfm?story_id=12414924 A biography of Warren Buffett]" (review of ''[[The Snowball]]''), ''[[The Economist]]'', Oct. 16, 2008.</ref> Buffett once commented, "I want to give my kids just enough so that they would feel that they could do anything, but not so much that they would feel like doing nothing".<ref>{{cite video|accessdate=May 20, 2008|title=An Exclusive Hour with Warren Buffett and Bill and Melinda Gates|publisher=[[Charlie Rose (talk show)|Charlie Rose]]}}</ref>

In a letter to Fortune Magazine's website in 2010 Buffett remarked:
{{cquote|<U+201C>My luck was accentuated by my living in a market system that sometimes produces distorted results, though overall it serves our country well... I<U+2019>ve worked in an economy that rewards someone who saves the lives of others on a battlefield with a medal, rewards a great teacher with thank-you notes from parents, but rewards those who can detect the mispricing of securities with sums reaching into the billions. In short, fate<U+2019>s distribution of long straws is wildly capricious.<U+201D>
. (Buffett Says <U+2018>Capricious<U+2019> Economy Requires Charity (Update1) by Hugh Son, Bloomberg, June 16, 2010 16:17 EDT)}}

This statement was made as part of a joint proposal with Bill Gates to encourage other wealthy individuals to pool some of their fortunes for charitable purposes.  

Bill Gates's wife Melinda urged people to learn a lesson from the philanthropic efforts of the family that sold its home and gave away half of its value, as detailed in ''[[The Power of Half]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://gulfnews.com/life-style/general/they-half-it-in-them-1.686505 |title=They half it in them |publisher=Gulf News |author=Bina Abraham |date=October 1, 2010 |accessdate=March 17, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.motherearthnews.com/natural-home-living/a-rich-gift-homemade-jelly-for-bill-melinda-gates.aspx |title=A Rich Gift: Homemade Jelly for Bill and Melinda Gates |work=Mother Earth News |date=February 22, 2011 |author=Robyn Griggs Lawrence|accessdate=March 10, 2011}}</ref>  On December 9, 2010, Buffett, Bill Gates, and [[Mark Zuckerberg]] (Facebook's CEO), signed a promise they called the "Gates-Buffett [[Giving Pledge]]", in which they promised to donate to charity at least half of their wealth over time, and invited others among the wealthy to donate 50% or more of their wealth to charity.<ref name="bbc">{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-10870361|title=US billionaires pledge 50% of their wealth to charity|date=August 4, 2010|publisher=BBC |accessdate=September 6, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Moss |first=Rosabeth |url=http://www.businessweek.com/managing/content/dec2010/ca20101214_945792.htm |title=Four Strategic Generosity Lessons|work=Business Week  |date=December 14, 2010 |accessdate=March 9, 2011}}</ref>

==Public positions==
Buffett's speeches are known for mixing business discussions with humor. Each year, Buffett presides over Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder meeting in the [[Qwest Center]] in [[Omaha, Nebraska|Omaha]], [[Nebraska]], an event drawing over 20,000 visitors from both United States and abroad, giving it the nickname "Woodstock of Capitalism".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters |title= Warren Buffett's Letters to Shareholders |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070322071600/http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters |archivedate=March 22, 2007|accessdate=May 20, 2008|publisher=[[Berkshire Hathaway]]}}</ref> Berkshire's annual reports and letters to shareholders, prepared by Buffett, frequently receive coverage by the financial media. Buffett's writings are known for containing quotations from sources as ranging  between the Bible and [[Mae West]],<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=May 20, 2008|url=http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/1993.html|title=Chairman's Letter<U+2014>1993|publisher=[[Berkshire Hathaway]]}}</ref> as well as advice in a Midwestern folk style, and numerous jokes.

===Buffett and tobacco===
During the [[RJR Nabisco]], Inc. hostile takeover fight in 1987, Buffett was quoted as telling John Gutfreund:<ref>{{cite book | author=Burrough, Bryan; Helyar, John | title=[[Barbarians at the Gate: The Fall of RJR Nabisco]] | publisher=[[Harper & Row]] | location=New York | year=1990 | isbn=0-060-16172-8}}</ref>

Speaking at Berkshire Hathaway Inc.'s 1994 annual meeting, Buffett said investments in tobacco are:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://legacy.library.ucsf.edu/tid/whg85e00/pdf |title='&#39;Warren Buffett Cools on His Attraction to Tobacco Business'&#39;, Jenell Wallace, Bloomberg news, Apr/25/94, Legacy Tobacco Documents Library, University of California San Diego Library |publisher=Legacy.library.ucsf.edu |accessdate=May 23, 2010}}</ref>

===Buffett and coal===
In 2007, Buffett's [[PacifiCorp]], a subsidiary of his [[MidAmerican Energy Company]], canceled six proposed coal-fired power plants. These included Utah's [[Intermountain Power Project]] Unit 3, Jim Bridger Unit 5, and four proposed plants previously included in PacifiCorp's Integrated Resource Plan. The cancellations came in the wake of pressure from regulators and citizen groups, including a petition drive organized by Salt Lake City commercial real estate broker Alexander Lofft and directed at Buffett personally. The 1,600 petitioners, who described themselves in a letter to Buffett as "a collection of citizens, business owners and managers, service professionals, public servants, and organization representatives ... your friends and new customers here in Utah," explained that, in their view, any further expansion of coal generation in Utah would "compromise our health, obscure our viewsheds, shrink and contaminate our watersheds, and thin out our most beloved snow pack," concluding that "our attractiveness as a place to live and work is also threatened, and so is our economic competitiveness as a major metro area and a state, compromising our recent gains in income and property values".<ref>[http://gristmill.grist.org/story/2008/4/14/01432/7381 "The Education of Warren Buffett: Why did the guru cancel six coal plants?"] Ted Nace, Gristmill, April 15, 2008</ref>

===Klamath river===
American Indian tribes and salmon fishermen sought to win support from Warren Buffett for a proposal to remove four hydroelectric dams from the [[Klamath River]]. He had David Sokol respond that the [[FERC]] would decide the question.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.usatoday.com/money/topstories/2008-05-03-3055404993_x.htm|title=Buffett again rebuffs advocates who want Klamath dams out| author=Josh Funk|date=5/3/2008|work=USA Today|ref=harv}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Bacher |first=Dan |url=http://www.indybay.org/newsitems/2009/05/01/18592169.php |title=Indybay.org |publisher=Indybay.org |date=May 1, 2009 |accessdate=May 23, 2010}}</ref>

===Trade deficit===
Buffett views the United States' expanding [[trade deficit]] as a trend that will devalue the US dollar and US assets. He believes that the US dollar will lose value in the long run, as a result of putting a larger portion of ownership of US assets in the hands of foreigners. In his letter to shareholders in March 2005, Warren Buffett predicted that in another ten years<U+2019> time the net ownership of the U.S. by outsiders would amount to $11 [[Trillion (short scale)|trillion]]. <blockquote>Americans ... would chafe at the idea of perpetually paying tribute to their creditors and owners abroad. A country that is now aspiring to an <U+2018>[[ownership society]]<U+2019> will not find happiness in <U+2013> and I<U+2019>ll use hyperbole here for emphasis <U+2013> a '[[sharecropping|sharecropping society]]<U+2019>.</blockquote>
Author [[Ann Pettifor]] has adopted the image in her writings and has stated: "He is right. And so the thing we must fear most now, is not just the collapse of banks and investment funds, or of the international financial architecture, but of a 'sharecropper society, angry at its downfall".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/08/06/AR2005080600862.html |title=A Sharecropper's Society? |work=The Washington Post  |date=August 7, 2005 |accessdate=February 23, 2009}}</ref>

===Dollar and gold===
The trade deficit induced Buffett to enter the foreign currency market for the first time in 2002. However, he substantially reduced his stake in 2005 as changing interest rates increased the costs of holding currency contracts. Buffett continues to be [[Bear market|bearish]] on the dollar, and says he is looking to acquire companies which derive a substantial portion of their revenues from outside the United States. Buffett emphasized the non-productive aspect of a [[gold standard]] for the USD in 1998 at Harvard: <blockquote>It gets dug out of the ground in Africa, or someplace. Then we melt it down, dig another hole, bury it again and pay people to stand around guarding it. It has no utility. Anyone watching from Mars would be scratching their head.</blockquote> In 1977 Buffett was also quoted as saying about stocks, gold, farmland, and inflation:<blockquote>Stocks are probably still the best of all the poor alternatives in an era of inflation <U+2013> at least they are if you buy in at appropriate prices.<ref>{{Cite journal | last=Buffett | first=Warren | title=How Inflation Swindles the Equity Investor | journal=Fortune | date=1977<U+2013>05 | ref=harv | postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref></blockquote>

===Taxes===
Buffett stated that he only paid 19% of his income for 2006 ($48.1&nbsp;million) in total federal taxes (due to their being from dividends & capital gains), while his employees paid 33% of theirs, despite making much less money.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=[[Forbes]]|date=November 26, 2007|pages=24, 42<U+2013>3|title=Warren Buffet|ref=harv}}</ref> <U+201C>How can this be fair?<U+201D> Buffet asked, regarding how little he pays in taxes compared to his employees. <U+201C>How can this be right?<U+201D> He also added:

Buffett favors the [[inheritance tax]], saying that repealing it would be like "choosing the 2020 Olympic team by picking the eldest sons of the gold-medal winners in the [[2000 Summer Olympics|2000 Olympics]]".<ref>{{cite news|accessdate=May 20, 2008| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/1170874.stm| title=Rich Americans back inheritance tax|publisher=BBC |date=February 14, 2001}}</ref> In 2007, Buffett testified before the Senate and urged them to preserve the estate tax so as to avoid a [[plutocracy]].<ref>{{cite journal| url=http://thehill.com/business--lobby/buffett-tells-senate-finance-panel-dynastic-wealth-on-the-rise-in-u.s.-2007-11-15.html| title=Buffett tells Senate Finance panel <U+2018>dynastic<U+2019> wealth on the rise in U.S. | author=Jim Snyder | date=November 15, 2007 |work=The Hill| publisher=[[The Hill (newspaper)]]| ref=harv }}</ref> Some critics have argued that Buffett (through Berkshire Hathaway) has a personal interest in the continuation of the estate tax, since Berkshire Hathaway has benefited from the estate tax in past business dealings and had developed and marketed insurance policies to protect policy holders against future estate tax payments.<ref>{{cite journal| url=http://old.nationalreview.com/issue/berlau200408180838.asp| title=Buffetted.

===Expensing of stock options===
He has been a strong proponent of [[stock option expensing]] on the Income Statement. At the 2004 annual meeting, he lambasted a bill before the United States Congress that would consider only some company-issued stock options compensation as an expense, likening the bill to one that was almost passed by the [[Indiana House of Representatives]] to [[Indiana Pi Bill|change the value of Pi]] from 3.14159 to 3.2 through legislative fiat.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A29807-2004Jul5.html |title=Warren Buffett, '&#39;Fuzzy Math And Stock Options '&#39;, The Washington Post, July&nbsp;6, 2004, Page A19 |work=The Washington Post  |date=July 6, 2004 |accessdate=May 23, 2010}}</ref>

===Investing in China===
Buffett invested in [[PetroChina]] Company Limited and in a rare move, posted a commentary<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=May 20, 2008|url=http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/sudan.pdf|format=PDF|title=Shareholder Proposal Regarding Berkshire<U+2019>s Investment In PetroChina|publisher=[[Berkshire Hathaway]]}}</ref> on Berkshire Hathaway's website stating why he would not divest from the company despite calls from some activists to do so, due to its connection with the Sudanese civil war that caused Harvard to divest from the company in 2005. He did, however, sell this stake soon afterwards, sparing him the billions of dollars he would have lost had he held on to the company in the midst of the steep drop in oil prices beginning in the summer of 2008.

In October 2008, Buffett invested in new energy automobile business by paying $230&nbsp;million for 10% of [[BYD Company]] ({{sehk|1211}}), which runs a subsidiary of electric automobile manufacturer [[BYD Auto]]. In less than one year, the investment has reaped him over 500% return of profit.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=September 16, 2009|url=http://www.chinastakes.com/2009/9/warren-buffets-500-return-from-byd-the-show-just-begun.html|title=Warren Buffet's 500% Return from BYD: The Show Just Begun? |publisher=[[ChinaStakes]]}}</ref>

==Books about Buffett==
Numerous books have been written about Warren Buffett and his investment strategies. In October 2008, ''[[USA Today]]'' reported that there were at least 47 books in print with Buffett's name in the title. The article quoted the CEO of [[Borders Books]], George Jones, as saying that the only other living persons named in as many book titles were U.S. presidents, major world political figures, and the [[14th Dalai Lama|Dalai Lama]].<ref name="name game">Del Jones, [http://www.usatoday.com/money/books/2008-10-22-buffett-books_N.htm "Book titles like to play the Warren Buffett name game,"] ''[[USA Today]]'', October 22, 2008.</ref> Buffett said that his own personal favorite is a collection of his essays called ''The Essays of Warren Buffett'',<ref>{{Cite book | author=Buffett, Warren; Cunningham, Lawrence | title=The Essays of Warren Buffett: Lessons for Corporate America, Second Edition | publisher=The Cunningham Group | isbn=978-0-9664461-2-8 }}
