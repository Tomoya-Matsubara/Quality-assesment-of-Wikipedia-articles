<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:confederations-cup.jpg|frame|The Confederations Cup]] -->The '''FIFA Confederations Cup''' is a [[football (soccer)]] tournament for national teams, held every two years by [[FIFA]]. It is contested by the winners of each of the six FIFA confederation championships ([[Confederation of African Football|CAF]], [[CONMEBOL]], [[UEFA]], [[Asian Football Confederation|AFC]], [[Oceania Football Confederation|OFC]], [[CONCACAF]]), along with the FIFA World Cup champion and the host country, to bring the number of teams up to eight.
When the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] champion is also winner of its confederation championship, then the World Cup runner-up also enters the Confederations Cup, ensuring eight teams for the tournament. In the [[Confederations Cup 2005|2005 tournament]], however, [[Brazil]], as World Cup champion, and World Cup runner-up [[Germany]], as host, had qualified.  When Brazil also won the [[Copa Am<U+00E9>rica]], the vacant eighth spot was awarded to [[Argentina]], runner-up in the Copa Am<U+00E9>rica.

The tournament was originally organised by and held in [[Saudi Arabia]] and called the '''King Fahd Cup''', contested in [[King Fahd Cup 1992|1992]] and [[King Fahd Cup 1995|1995]] by the Saudi national side and some continental champions. In [[1997]], [[FIFA]] took over the organization of the tournament, named it the ''FIFA Confederations Cup'' and staged the competition every two years. Since 2005, the tournament has been held once in every four years, held one year prior to each World Cup in the country that will host the World Cup the following year. This decision was made to make the Confederations Cup a dress rehearsal for the World Cup. 

The [[Confederations Cup 2003|2003 tournament]] was marred by tragedy, when the [[Cameroon national football team|Cameroon]] player [[Marc-Vivien Fo<U+00E9>]] collapsed and died during the semi-final against [[Colombia national football team|Colombia]].

For the next edition of the tournament Italy (World Champion) and South Africa (Host country) are already qualified.

==Broadcasting rights==
*'''United Kingdom''': Live coverage of selected matches has been shown on terrestrial channel [[Five (TV)|Five]], formerly known as [[Channel 5]]. Delayed coverage is usually shared between Five and [[satellite]]/[[cable television|cable]] network British [[Eurosport]]. Seen as a lower key event, the Confederations Cup has never been shown on main [[BBC]] and [[ITV]] channels. The rights are generally bought up quietly, around six months before the main event for much less money than the [[FIFA World Cup]].
*In '''Italy''' RAI must, by law, broadcast the ''[[Italy national football team|Azzurri]]'' matches, therefore the state broadcaster is very likely to buy part of the rights (if not all of them, since they are cheaper than the World Cup ones) for the Confederations Cup when Italy participates.
