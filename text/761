'''Lev Tikhomirov''' ([[Russian language|Russian]]: '''<U+041B><U+0435><U+0432> <U+0422><U+0438><U+0445><U+043E><U+043C><U+0438><U+0440><U+043E><U+0432>'''; 1850-1922) was a Russian revolutionary and one of members on the Executive Committee of the [[Narodnaya Volya]].

Lev Tikhomirov was born in the Don province, [[Russia]]. As a student he was deeply influenced by the ideas of Sergei Nechayev and joined the People's Will group.

In 1880 there was strong disagreement in [[People's Will]] about the purpose of [[terrorism]]. One faction that included [[Nikolai Morozov]] and [[Olga Liubatovich]] argued that the main objective was to force the government to grant democratic rights to the people of [[Russia]]. However, another faction led by Tikhomirov believed that it was possible for a small group of [[revolutionaries]] to use terrorism in order to directly capture power.

Olga Liubatovich and Nikolai Morozov strongly disagreed with the ideas of Lev Tikhomirov. They argued that this was an example of Jacobinism and would result in the kind of dictatorship that had taken place after the French Revolution. Liubatovich and Morozov left the organization and Tikomirov's views prevailed.

After the [[assassination]] of [[Alexander II]] Tikhomirov fled from Russia. Tikhomirov lived in several European countries and published biographies of [[Sophia Perovskaya]], [[Andrei Zhelyabov]] and [[Nikolai Kibalchich]].

In 1888 Tikhomirov apologized for his past revolutionary activities and was allowed to return to Russia. He then became an opponent of reform and became one of Russia's leading right-wing journalists. Lev Tikhomirov died in 1922.
