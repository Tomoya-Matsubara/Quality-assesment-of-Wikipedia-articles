===Future of Cole Hall===
On February 26, Illinois Governor [[Rod Blagojevich]] and University President [[John G. Peters]] proposed the demolition of the current Cole Hall. The proposal comes as a response to the "bad" memories of the students who have to attend classes in the building. The proposal would tear down Cole Hall, leave the Cole Hall site as a memorial site, and erect a new building called "Memorial Hall" nearby, at a cost of approximately $40 million.<ref name="Northern Star"> {{cite news|title=Blagojevich, Peters propose $40M to replace Cole| url=http://www.northernstar.info/article.php?id=2466 |publisher=Northern Star |date=[[2008-02-28]] |accessdate=2008-03-15}}</ref>

However, due to mixed emotions on the decision, President Peters sent out a message to all NIU students via their student email accounts, soliciting comments from students and the extended NIU family. In addition, a committee has been established to help reach a consensus on the future of Cole Hall.<ref name="Northern Star Online"> {{cite news|title=Peters announces three-phase process for Cole Hall decision| url=http://www.northernstar.info/article/2605/|publisher=Northern Star |date=[[2008-03-06]] |accessdate=2008-03-15}}</ref>

==Earlier incident and possible threats==
The campus was shut down on [[December 10]] [[2007]], the first day during exam week, after [[graffiti]] was found on a restroom wall warning of a possible shooting. A university spokesman said that the warning, which was discovered December 10, made reference to the [[Virginia Tech massacre]], in which 32 people were killed, but it could not be immediately determined whether the threat was related to the shootings on [[February 14]] [[2008]]. The ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' reported at that time that an unknown person posted the graffiti in the Grant Towers D residence hall, which included a racial slur and the notation "What time? The VA tech shooters{{sic}} messed up w/ having only one shooter."<ref name="msnbc"/> However, NIU President John Peters stated that he did not believe that the December incident is connected to the February 14 shootings.<ref name="FoxNews_Peters-statement">Underwood, Melissa.

A few days before February 14, the university also received another threat of unspecified nature, which was dismissed due to lack of credibility.<ref name="time_mag">{{cite news|url=Gray, Steven|url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1714069,00.html|title=How the NIU Massacre Happened|publisher=''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''|date=[[February 16]] [[2008]]|accessdate=2008-02-18}}</ref>
