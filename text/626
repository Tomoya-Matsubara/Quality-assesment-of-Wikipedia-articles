== Background ==
{{Main|Olympic symbols#Mascots|l1=Olympic mascots}}

Since the [[1968 Winter Olympics]] in [[Grenoble]], France, the Olympic Games have always had a mascot(s), typically an animal native to the area where the Games take place, or occasionally human figures representing local cultural heritage. The first major mascot in the Olympic Games was [[Misha]] in the [[1980 Summer Olympics]] in Moscow. Misha was used extensively during the opening and closing ceremonies, had a TV animated cartoon and appeared on several merchandise products. Indeed, most Olympic merchandise of the current day focus on the mascots, rather than the [[Olympic symbols#Flag|Olympic flag]] or other emblems. Subsequent mascots were widely publicised and featured in the Games. Although the 2010 Summer Youth Olympics is the first Games of the type, being a departure from the senior Olympics, the tradition of carrying a mascot(s) has remained.

== Development ==
In early 2009, seven shortlisted mascot design proposals were submitted to the [[Singapore Youth Olympic Games Organising Committee]] (SYOGOC). Amongst the seven, the proposal of Cubix Internatinal, a company specialising in branding, animation and character development, was eventually selected. Cubix initially sought to develop robot mascots, intending to showcase Singapore as a "technologically advanced country". Research on Olympic mascots however prompted them to move away from the robot theme, and focus on animal mascots. The company stated it wanted to developed a pair of mascots "who had contrasting yet complementary personalities." The company's Mascots and Puppets Specialists team transformed the mascots from design to actual models.<ref name="">http://www.singapore2010.sg/public/whyohgee/en/en_the_games_section/en_updates/en_mascot.html</ref>

There were issues over the materials used to build the mascots. Eventually, foam was selected as the main material for the mascot suits. The mascots suits were noted to be heavy, with Lyo's head weighing at {{convert|8|kg}} and Merly's head weighing {{convert|6|kg}}. The heads would be strapped onto a harness donned by the mascot wearer. An inbult fan in the suit and optional vests lined with cool packs are also noted to keep the mascot wearer from gaining excessive heat.<ref>http://www.singapore2010.sg/public/whyohgee/en/en_the_games_section/en_updates/en_mascot.html</ref>

Lyo's name is the initials (L.Y.O.) of "Lion of the [[Youth Olympic Games|Youth Olympics]]",<ref name="Lyo"></ref> while Merly's name stems from the combination of "mer", which means the sea, and "l" and "y" which stands for liveliness and youthfulness. The two characters are an allusion to the "[[Lion City]]" label of Singapore, and the Merlion, a [[National symbols and emblems of Singapore|national symbol of Singapore]], respectively. Additionally, Dr. Balakrishnan commented that the duo were "an interesting play on fire and water". He added that "there are aspects of which (the mascots) we clearly can identify with as Singaporeans, but really what we hope is these mascots will be embraced by Singaporeans as well as the visitors who come."<ref name="CNA"></ref>

The [[Lion#Mane|mane]] of Lyo is stated to resemble the Flame of Passion of the Spirit of Youth, the emblem of the Games. It is also a reference to the [[Singapore 2010 Youth Olympics bid|Singapore 2010 bid]] tagline "Blazing the Trail". The paw of the mascot is also said to be shaped like the [[Pulau Ujong|island of Singapore]].<ref name="Lyo"></ref> Merly is said to be [[Vegetarianism|vegetarian]] due to "a deep respect for all living creatures", and her is said to be shaped like a heart - representations of the character attributes given by the mascot creators.<ref name="Merly"></ref>

== Outreach ==
The two mascots appear in various activities and programmes, including those to schools and roadshows and launches. The Olympic theme was featured in Singapore's [[National Day Parade]], due to the two events' proximity (both being held in August), and Lyo and Merly were seen participating in pre-parade activities.<ref>{{Cite news | author = Satish Cheney | title = August a month of fanfare and festivities with YOG & NDP | newspaper = [[Channel NewsAsia]] | location = Singapore | publisher = [[MediaCorp]] | date = 29 July 2010 | url = http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/1072226/1/.html | accessdate = 2010-08-09 }}</ref>

Lyo and Merly were also widely featured in memorabilia of the Games.
