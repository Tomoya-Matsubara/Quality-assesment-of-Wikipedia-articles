[[File:Cavour Bridge, Rome, Italy.jpg|thumb|Ponte Cavour]]
'''Ponte Cavour''' is a bridge in [[Rome]], linking piazza del Porto di Ripetta to lungotevere dei Mellini, in the [[Campo Marzio]] and [[Prati (rione of Rome)|Prati]] rioni. It also links the area around Piazza Cavour to the area around the [[Ara Pacis]] in the [[Campus Martius]].

Around 110 metres long and designed by the architect [[Angelo Vescovali]] with five arches and [[travertine]] facings, it was built between 1896 and 1901 to replace the temporary 1878 ''passerella di Ripetta''. It opened on 25 May 1901 and is named after [[Camillo Benso, conte di Cavour]], one of the pioneers of Italian unification.
