'''Route 130''' is a mostly North/South provincial highway in the [[Canada|Canadian]] province of [[New Brunswick]]. The road has a length of approximately 108 kilometers, and services small, otherwise isolated rural communities. In these areas, the highway is often unofficially referred to as "Main  Street."  The Highway is known as Broadway, Portage Road in [[Grand Falls, New Brunswick|Grand Falls]] and West Riverside Drive in [[Perth-Andover, New Brunswick|Perth-Andover]].

==History==

Route 130 was created in 1965 as a short spur from the [[Trans-Canada Highway]] into Grand Falls. When a new 4-lane TCH was opened in 2007, the route was extended by over 95 km south from Grand Falls along the former TCH to [[Aroostook, New Brunswick|Aroostook]], along a formerly unnumbered route (part of the original [[New Brunswick Route 2|Route 2]] until the 1960s) from Aroostook to Perth-Andover, the former TCH again from Perth-Andover to [[Somerville, New Brunswick|Somerville]] (near [[Hartland, New Brunswick|Hartland]]), and a new access road that meets up with the new highway at [[Waterville, Carleton County, New Brunswick|Waterville]].
