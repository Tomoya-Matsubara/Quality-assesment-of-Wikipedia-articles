'''Airspeed AS.6 Envoy''' was a light, twin-engined transport aircraft designed by [[Airspeed Ltd.]] in [[Great Britain]]. 

==Development==

The first flight, with the aircraft C-ACMT took place on [[June 26]], [[1934]] and in July 1934, the aircraft was presented to the public for the first time at an exhibition by Society of British Aerospace. In October 1936, the British [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] ordered 136 Envoys for the role of crew-training. These further developed aircraft were given a new designation; [[Airspeed AS 10 Oxford]].

==Operational use==
The machine proved as commercial success. [[William Morris, 1st Viscount Nuffield|Lord Nuffield]] bought a Envoy and won thereby the air race from [[London]] to [[Johannesburg]] in 1934.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}. Soon after, orders came from the whole Commonwealth. Two aircraft went to the [[Ansett Airlines]] in [[Australia]]. [[North Eastern Airways]] also used the AS.6. In [[Czechoslovakia]], the [[Czech Airlines|CSA]] ordered four AS.6 Envoy JC in 1937. 

The Airspeeds AS.6 Envoy also entered the Air Forces of different countries, besides Great Britain, the aircraft was used in Spain, Japan, South Africa, Finland and China was used and some others. The [[RAF]] used a small number of AS.6 in a military configuration. Seven machines were ordered for joint use by the [[South African Air Force]] and [[South African Airways]], with three being delivered in military form and four delivered to South African Airways, where they were  used on the air route between Johannesburg - [[Bloemfontein]] - [[Port Elizabeth]] on [[12 October]] [[1936]].<ref name = "jackson1"/>  All seven could be transformed by four persons within four hours from the transportation version into a light bomber or reconnaissance aircraft. In this configuration the crew consisted of four; pilot, navigator, radio operator and gunner.<ref name ="jackson1">{{Cite book

The Envoy was involved in a tragic accident in Australia. The VH-UXY, carrying Lieutenant [[Charles Ulm]], disappeared in 1934, during an attempt to fly the Pacific route between [[Oakland]] and [[Honolulu]].<ref name ="jackson1"/>  Two AS.6 aircraft were to participate in the [[MacRobertson Air Race]] in 1934, from England to Australia, but both remained on the ground, but one was damaged  on the eve of the race and was withdrawn, and the other, a specially modified version with long range tanks (the '''AS 8 Viceroy''') got as far as Athens before abandoning the race.<ref name ="jackson1"/>

During the [[Spanish Civil War]], two AS.6 Envoy were used on the nationalist side <ref name = "jackson1"/>as reconnaissance aircraft or light bombers.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

In May 1937, the British King traded his [[de Havilland Dragon Rapide]] for an Airspeed AS.6J Envoy III. The AS.6's good stability and flaps, as well as its low landing speed (less than 100 km/h) was decisive. The aircraft received had the identification code G-AEXX and was painted in distinctive red and blue colours .<ref name ="jackson1"/>

During the Second World War, the German [[Luftwaffe]] captured some machines and used them as trainer aircraft. Luftwaffe gave one aircraft to Finland on [[22 January]] [[1942]], as reparation for the mistakenly shooting down of a Finnish [[de Havilland Dragon Rapide]]. This aircraft was used between 1942 and 1943. Likewise, one aircraft was used between 1941 to 1943 by the Slovaks.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}
