'''[[Aruba]]''' sent a delegation to compete at the '''[[2004 Summer Olympics]]''' in [[Athens]], [[Greece]]. The delegation's participation in the Athens Olympics marked Aruba's fifth appearance at the Summer Olympics since the Dutch colony's debut at the [[1988 Summer Olympics]] in Seoul, South Korea. Four athletes (three men and one woman) competed across three sports ([[Pierre de Windt]] in track and field, [[Davy Bisslik]] and [[Roshendra Vrolijk]] in swimming, and [[Isnardo Faro]] weightlifting). None of the track or swimming athletes advanced past the first round in their events, and as of Athens, no Arubans had medaled in any events. Roshendra Vrolijk bore Aruba's flag at the ceremonies.

==Background==

[[Aruba]] is a small island colony of 100,000 people that is part of the Kingdom of [[the Netherlands]], and has been under Dutch control since the 1630s. The island lies in the southern [[Caribbean Sea]] just to the north of [[Venezuela]], and is very near to the Dutch colonies of [[Cura<U+00E7>ao]] and [[Bonaire]]. The colony originally was part of an autonomous union with those two islands in what was known as the [[Netherlands Antilles]], but Aruba seceded from that union in 1986. The Netherlands continues to regulate all of its foreign affairs.<ref name=cia /> While the first Dutch Antilean delegation to the Olympics was sent during the [[1952 Summer Olympics]] in Helsinki, Finland,<ref name=aho-sr /> The first uniquely Aruban delegation participated two years after the island's secession from the Netherlands Antilles at the [[1988 Summer Olympics]] in Seoul, South, Korea. Between then and the 2004 Athens Olympics, Aruba had sent a delegation to all five Summer Olympic games.<ref name=aru-sr /> The most substantial Aruban delegation was in 1988, when it included eight athletes. This delegation included more women and encompassed more sports than any Aruban delegation since then (up to the Athens Olympics).<ref name=aru-sr />

At the Athens Olympics, four athletes (three men and one woman) participated across three sports in four distinct events. Swimmer [[Roshendra Vrolijk]] was Aruba's flag bearer at the ceremonies.<ref name=aru-sr />
