==Spacecraft==
Aditya is proposed to be sent to space by 2015<U+2013>16 to study the [[solar corona]].<ref name="LaunchDelay">[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-09-09/india/33712860_1_parameters-of-space-weather-three-year-mission-polar-satellite-launch-vehicle Aditya 1 launch delayed to 2015-16] Times of India Retrieved 9 September 2012</ref> This part of the Sun has temperatures of over one million degrees, with raging solar winds that reach a velocity of up to 1000&nbsp;km a second. The satellite will carry as its payload an advanced solar [[coronagraph]].<ref name="Hindu1" /><ref>{{cite web |url= http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-09-09/india/33712860_1_parameters-of-space-weather-three-year-mission-polar-satellite-launch-vehicle|title= Aditya 1 launch delayed to 2015<U+2013>16|author= Srinivas Laxman & Rhik Kundu, TNN|date=9 September 2012|work= [[The Times of India]]|publisher= [[Bennett, Coleman & Co.

It will be a small {{convert|400|kg|lb|0}} [[satellite]]  projected to cost about {{INRConvert|50|c|-1}},<ref name="Hindu1" /> and likely to be placed into a near earth orbit of 600&nbsp;km. The spacecraft's mission will be to study the fundamental problems of coronal heating, and other phenomena that take place in the Earth's [[magnetosphere]].

==Objectives==
* to study the Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) 
* to study the crucial physical parameters for space weather such as the coronal magnetic field structures, evolution of the coronal magnetic field etc.<ref>[http://www.isro.org/scripts/futureprogramme.aspx Future Programme of ISRO]</ref>

==Progress==
This is one of the first scheduled projects in a road map formulated by the Advisory Committee for Space Research.<ref name="Hindu1" /> A working group of individuals from the [[ISRO Satellite Centre]], [[Udaipur Solar Observatory]], [[Indian Institute of Astrophysics]], Radio Astronomy Centre, [[National Centre for Radio Astrophysics]], and several universities.<ref name="Hindu1" /> was constituted to work out the optimum configuration for the coronagraph, among other parameters. The design of solar coronograph has been completed by Indian Institute of Astrophysics.<ref name="expressbuzz">[http://expressbuzz.com/cities/bangalore/design-for-space-based-solar-coronagraph-ready/195622.html Design of space-based solar chronograph ready] ''New Indian Express''. Retrieved on 22 September 2010.</ref>

ISRO is working on development of sensors and thermal structures of the satellite after which a prototype of the satellite is expected to be built by 2011.<ref name="expressbuzz" /> Aditya is to be launched in 2015-16, due to delays in the technical design and funding.<ref name="LaunchDelay"/>
