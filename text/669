The '''Battle of Achelous''' took place in 1359 near the river [[Achelous river|Achelous]], in [[Aetolia]], modern [[Greece]] fought between [[Albanians|Albanian]] troops, under [[Peter Losha]], and forces of the [[Despotate of Epirus]], under [[Nikephoros II Orsini]]. The Albanians defeated Orsini's army, which suffered massive casualties during the battle. The battle established two despotates from regions previously part of the Despotate of Epirus: the [[Despotate of Arta]] and the [[Despotate of Angelokastron and Lepanto]].

== Prelude ==
Since the early 14th century the power of the [[Despotate of Epirus]] had been decreasing while the Albanian  rulers had been increasing their control over many areas of the despotate.<ref name="mb">{{cite book|last=Van Antwerp|first=John|title=The Late Medieval Balkans: A Critical Survey from the Late Twelfth Century to the Ottoman Conquest|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=QDFVUDmAIqIC&pg=PA350&dq=Aetolia+1359&lr=&hl=en&cd=1#v=onepage&q=Aetolia%201359&f=false|year=1994|publisher=[[University of Michigan Press]]|isbn=0472082604|pages=348<U+00E2><U+0080><U+0093>51}}</ref> [[Nikephoros II Orsini]], Despot of Epirus decided to establish closer relations to the [[Serbian Empire]] by dropping his previous wife Maria Cantacuzena and marrying the sister of [[Stefan Uro<U+0161> IV Du<U+0161>an]]'s widow.

== Battle ==
Nikephoros II Orsini gathered his forces and marched against the Albanians in the regions they had settled in [[Aetolia]], modern western [[Greece]]. The Albanians gathered their forces and under the leadership of [[Peter Losha]] fought against Orsini in the late spring of 1359 near the [[Achelous river]]. The Albanians won the battle. Orsini was killed and his whole army was destroyed.<ref name="mb"/><ref name="arbel"/><ref>{{cite book|last=MacGillivray|first=Donald|title=The Byzantine family of Kantakouzenos (Cantacuzenus) ca. 1100-1460: a genealogical and prosopographical study|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=HqdBAAAAIAAJ&q=Battle+of+Acheloos+1359&dq=Battle+of+Acheloos+1359&hl=en&cd=5|series=Dumbarton Oaks studies|volume=11|year=1968|publisher=Dumbarton Oaks Center for Byzantine Studies|page=132}}</ref>

== Aftermath ==
After Nikephoros's death the remaining major towns in the Despotate Epirus, being under risk of capture by the Albanian troops, submitted to [[Simeon Uro<U+0161>]] and the remaining areas of the despotate were divided between him and Radoslav Hlapen.<ref name="mb"/> Simeon unable to expel the Albanian leaders tried to maintain indirect control of the Despotate of Epirus by recognizing as Despots of the regions of Arta and Aetolia Peter Losha and Gjin Bua Shpata, who created the [[Despotate of Arta]] and the [[Despotate of Angelokastron and Lepanto]].<ref name="mb"/> 

Although most of Epirus was under Albanian rule due to their tribal structure and lack of central authority the Albanians didn't replace any existing Greek or Serbian rule with a centralized Albanian state.<ref name="mb"/> As an aftermath by 1366-7 only the city of [[Ioannina]] wasn't under Albanian control.<ref name="mb"/>
