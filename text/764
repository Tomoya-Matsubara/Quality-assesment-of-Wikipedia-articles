"'''200'''" is the fifth episode of the [[South Park (season 14)|fourteenth season]] of ''[[South Park]]'', and the 200th overall episode of the series. It originally aired on [[Comedy Central]] in the United States on April 14, 2010. In the episode, [[Tom Cruise]] and all other celebrities who have been mocked by residents of South Park in the past plan to file a [[class action]] lawsuit against the town, but Cruise promises to end the lawsuit if the town can get the [[Muslim]] prophet [[Muhammad]] to meet him.

The episode was written and directed by series co-creator [[Trey Parker]], and was rated [[TV-MA]] L in the United States. To celebrate their landmark episode, Parker and fellow series co-creator [[Matt Stone]] combined many of ''South Park''{{'s}} past storylines and controversies. The Muhammad subplot, similar to the one previously featured in the [[South Park (season 10)|season 10]] episode "[[Cartoon Wars Part II|Cartoon Wars]]", refers to Comedy Central's past refusal to allow images of Muhammad to be shown on the network in response to the riots and threats generated from controversial cartoons in [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy|2005]] and [[Lars Vilks Muhammad drawings controversy|2007]] of Muhammad in European newspapers.

"200" includes many celebrities that have been mocked in previous episodes, including Cruise, [[Rob Reiner]], [[Steven Spielberg]], [[Kanye West]], [[Paris Hilton]],  [[George Lucas]] and [[Mel Gibson]]. An additional subplot includes Cartman learning he may not know the true identity of his father. It is said in the [[South Park (season 2)|season 2]] episode "[[Cartman's Mom Is Still a Dirty Slut]]" that Cartman's [[hermaphrodite]] [[Liane Cartman|mother]] is his father, but the events of "200" and [[201 (South Park)|the subsequent episode]] reveal that this is not the case.

"200" received mostly positive reviews. According to [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen Media Research]], the episode was seen by 3.33 million viewers, making it the most watched cable television program of the night. Both "200" and the sequel episode "[[201 (South Park)|201]]" were nominated for the [[Primetime Emmy Award]] for Outstanding Animated Program in 2010.<ref name='2010emmy'>{{cite web | url = http://www.emmys.com/sites/emmys.com/files/62ndemmys_noms.pdf | title = Complete Emmy lisitngs | accessdate = 2010-07-08 | first = Emmy Awards | format = PDF | publisher = Emmy Award}}</ref>
Within a week of the episode's original broadcast date, the website for the radical Muslim organization [[Revolution Muslim]] posted an entry warning Parker and Stone they risked getting murdered for airing the episode, which several media outlets and observers interpreted as a threat. As a result, Comedy Central heavily censored portions of "201" by removing images and references to Muhammad.

==Plot==
While on a school [[field trip]] to a [[candy]] factory, [[Butters Stotch|Butters]] spots actor [[Tom Cruise]] working there, packing [[fudge]] into boxes. [[Stan Marsh|Stan]], who previously told Cruise that his acting is not as good as others' in "[[Trapped in the Closet (South Park)|Trapped in the Closet]]", accidentally insults him again by calling him a "[[:wikt:fudge packer|fudge packer]]", as Cruise claims to be [[fly fishing]]. Cruise then recruits 200 other celebrities who have been ridiculed by the town of South Park to bring a [[class action]] lawsuit against the town. Stan returns to the factory with his [[Randy and Sharon Marsh|dad]] to try to apologize and convince Cruise to drop the suit, but also finds it difficult not to call him a fudge packer as well since he was literally packing fudge while they spoke. An angry Cruise agrees to do so, but only if they can help Cruise meet [[Muhammad]]. This causes an uproar because [[depictions of Muhammad]] are forbidden, and the townsfolk fear that forcing Muhammad to appear in public will drive [[Islamic terrorism|Muslim radicals]] to bomb the town. Stan and Kyle go to the [[Super Best Friends]], a squad of superhero-like religious figures of which Muhammad is a member, to request he return with them to South Park. Meanwhile, it is revealed that Cruise and the other celebrities only want Muhammad for his "goo", as Rob Reiner, previously shown to be filled with "goo" in "[[Butt Out]]", has invented a machine to transfer Muhammad's "goo" to the celebrities, which they believe will make them immune to ridicule, just like Muhammad.

By this time, [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] arrives with "Mitch Connor", a face painted on Cartman's hand as one-half of a [[ventriloquism|ventriloquist act]]. Previously, Connor had [[Fat Butt and Pancake Head|successfully impersonated]] actress [[Jennifer Lopez]], and now Cartman and Connor return to the Lopez imitation in order to get involved in the lawsuit along with the other celebrities. Connor soon secretly convinces Cartman that they should steal Muhammad's goo for themselves to sell on the black market for more than the lawsuit could offer. Meanwhile, Kyle and Stan convince the Super Best Friends to let Muhammad come to town, but only if he stays in the back of a [[U-Haul]] truck and is not seen. When the townspeople realize they must bring Muhammad to Cruise's limo, they allegedly put him inside a bear mascot outfit. South Park is about to give Muhammad to the celebrities when the exchange is interrupted by a bomb planted by the [[Ginger Kids|Ginger Separatist Movement]], a group of fair-skinned, red-haired children who are tired of being made fun of for their physical appearance. The Gingers want Muhammad for themselves, hoping to use his goo for their own means. They threaten to blow up the town if Muhammad is not turned over to them.

The people of South Park decide to turn Muhammad over to the Gingers, fearing the violence that will befall their town if they do not. The celebrities are angered by this change in events, but refuse to resort to violence for fear of ruining their careers. Instead, the celebrities decide to awaken the rebuilt [[Mecha-Streisand]], a giant mechanical monster form of [[Barbra Streisand]], who previously terrorized the town of South Park before being destroyed. The celebrities hope to use Mecha-Streisand to force South Park to accept their demands. Meanwhile, due to the chain of events, Cartman decides Connor's scheme has become too complicated and tries to quit, but Connor convinces him to stay involved by revealing that the townspeople of South Park have lied to Cartman about his true father. Although they previously claimed his [[hermaphrodite|hermaphroditic]] [[Liane Cartman|mother]] was also his father, Connor insists this is a lie. Cartman confronts his school teacher [[Mr. Garrison]] and Garrison's old hand puppet [[Mr. Hat]], who admits to Cartman there was indeed a cover-up. Mecha-Streisand roars threateningly and continues her reign of destruction. The episode ends on that [[cliffhanger]] note.

Stone said in writing the episode, they were determined not to produce a [[clip show]], but to merge all of the old ideas into a new, original script. The process proved challenging for the duo because it involved incorporating many ideas, subplots and characters into a single episode.<ref name="Boing" /> Parker and Stone included a joke about this process at the start of the episode, when Cartman and Kyle are fighting with each other, and Stan accuses them of just "rehashing a bunch of old stuff".<ref name="AVClub">{{Cite news |last=O'Neal |first=Sean |title=South Park: "200" |work=[[The A.V.

<!-- NOTE: This list must be sourced, so if you add a celebrity, please also include a source that indicates they were in the episode "200", as well as a source indicating what previous South Park episode they appeared in. -->

Near the end of "200", the celebrities seek assistance from singer and actress Barbra Streisand, who resembles a giant two-legged mechanical monster. This is a reference to Streisand's appearance in the first season episode "[[Mecha-Streisand]]", in which she transforms into a monster in the style of [[Mechagodzilla]] from the [[Godzilla (franchise)|Godzilla franchise]].<ref name="DailyMail" /> The Mecha-Streisand featured in "200" is designed with more sophisticated computer imagery than the original, which was a simple cut-out style cartoon like the rest of ''South Park''.<ref name="AVClub" /><ref name="IGN" /> Although Parker and Stone have maintained that most of the celebrities they mock in ''South Park'' are chosen at random, with no personal animosity behind it, Barbra Streisand is one of the few they actively and vehemently dislike.<ref>{{Cite video | people=[[Trey Parker|Parker, Trey]] |date=2003|title=South Park: The Complete First Season: "Mecha-Streisand"|format=Audio commentary |medium=CD|publisher=Comedy Central}}</ref> Streisand, in turn, has been critical of ''South Park'' and her portrayal in it, and has accused the show of adding "to the cynicism and negativity in our culture, especially in children".<ref name="Mirabella">{{cite news|title=The Way She Is|last=Dreifus|first=Claudia|authorlink=Claudia Dreifus|date=May 1998|work=[[Hachette Filipacchi M<U+00E9>dias]]}}</ref>

===Cartman's father===
The episode ends with a [[cliffhanger]] involving Cartman's father.<ref name="IGN" /><ref name="WCAU" /> The identity of Cartman's father made up a major plot point at the end of the [[South Park (season 1)|first season]], culminating in the [[South Park (season 2)|second season]] episode "[[Cartman's Mom Is Still a Dirty Slut]]", in which it is revealed Cartman's mother, [[Liane Cartman]], is a [[hermaphrodite]] and, in fact, is Cartman's father. "200" is the first episode to return to the matter and suggest this was not the actual truth.<ref name="EW0415" /> Throughout the episode, Cartman uses a hand-puppet con-artist named Mitch Connor, who had, presumably, just been made up by Cartman in trying to fool Kyle in the seventh season episode "[[Fat Butt and Pancake Head]]", resuming his role in pretending to be [[Jennifer Lopez]] and utilizing many offensive [[Hispanic]] stereotypes in his portrayal of her.<ref name="AVClub" /><ref name="IGN" /> The hand puppet portrayal is very similar to the work of Spanish ventriloquist [[Se<U+00F1>or Wences]].<ref name="EW0415" />

Several other references to previous ''South Park'' episodes are featured throughout "200". It marks the reappearance of [[Herbert Garrison#Mr. Hat|Mr. Hat]], a hand puppet that had been frequently used by Mr. Garrison during the early ''South Park'' seasons, but had long been abandoned in later episodes.<ref name="IGN" /><ref name="EW0415" /> During the second half of "200", an army of red-haired "ginger kids" attempt to capture Muhammad themselves. Several ''South Park'' episodes, most prominently the ninth season episode "[[Ginger Kids]]", have featured the ginger kids, which are children with fair skin, freckles and red hair. In most cases, they have been made the subject of ridicule by Cartman, who views them in an offensively stereotypical way.<ref name="EW0415" /><ref>{{Cite news |work=[[Metro (Associated Metro Limited)|Metro]] |title=Celebrating South Park's 200 episode: Five of the best |date=April 15, 2010 |url=http://www.metro.co.uk/news/821914-celebrating-south-parks-200-episode-five-of-the-best |accessdate=April 15, 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100418210433/http://www.metro.co.uk/news/821914-celebrating-south-parks-200-episode-five-of-the-best| archivedate= 18 April 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

==Cultural references==
During one scene, a frustrated Tom Cruise angrily jumps up and down on a couch while Oprah Winfrey sits next to him. This is a reference to [[Jumping the couch|incident on ''The Oprah Winfrey Show'']] in 2005, in which Cruise repeatedly jumped on the couch next to Oprah, fell to one knee and loudly professed his love for actress [[Katie Holmes]]. Cruise has been repeatedly mocked for his behavior.<ref name="DailyMail" /> In another scene, George Lucas and Steven Spielberg are shown to have actor [[Harrison Ford]] leashed, chained and ball-gagged, as the actor wears the fedora he wore in the [[Indiana Jones]] films. This is a reference to the [[South Park (season 12)|twelfth season]] episode "[[The China Probrem]]", in which Lucas and Spielberg literally rape Indiana Jones repeatedly, which served as a commentary by Parker and Stone for the poor quality of the 2008 Spielberg/Lucas film, ''[[Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull]]''.<ref name="EW0415" /> A cartoon image of film director [[Tim Burton]] is featured in the episode, despite having not been previously ridiculed by the show. In the episode, Burton is mocked for not having an original idea since the 1988 comedy horror film ''[[Beetlejuice]]'', and for his tendency to feature film actor [[Johnny Depp]] in so many of his films that he should "just have sex with him [Johnny Depp] already".<ref name="AVClub" /> Cartman's Jennifer Lopez hand-puppet repeatedly demands food from the American restaurant chain [[Taco Bell]], particularly [[enchirito]]s, which is one of the many Hispanic stereotypes utilized by the character.<ref name="AVClub" />  Also, when the celebrities are discussing who to bring in to help capture Mohammed, Barbra Streisand is referenced as "her," to which the discussion goes "her who?" "her" "oh...her."  This is slightly reminiscent of the movie Little Shop of Horrors when Rick Moranis and Steve Martin are talking about Audrey, who the dentist had physically abused, where Steve asks "what did I ever do to you" and Rick answers "it wasn't what you did to me, it was what you did to her" Steve: "her? oh...her" {{citation needed|date=January 2012}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.script-o-rama.com/movie_scripts/l/little-shop-of-horrors-script.html |title=Little Shop Of Horrors Script - transcript from the screenplay and/or Rick Moranis and Steve Martin musical movie based on the play |publisher=Script-o-rama.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-11}}</ref>

The episode received mostly positive reviews. Ken Tucker of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' said he was surprised by the complexity of "200" and the amount of ''South Park'' references and subplots it encompassed, especially the questions over Cartman's father. Tucker praised the episode, and said, "With jokes raining down like hell-fire, the 200th episode spared no one except the South Park kids themselves."<ref name="EW0415" /> Ramsey Isler of ''[[IGN]]'' said it was fun to identify all the references to past ''South Park'' moments, but felt "200" itself didn't stand out as a great episode. Isler said the new material wasn't very funny, and that the rehashed material was not as funny as the first time they were shown, which was disappointing due to the hype surrounding the episode.<ref name="IGN" /> ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' writer Sean O'Neal said the episode was funny, but that the original material was far outnumbered by rehashed jokes. O'Neal said the use of all the celebrities demonstrated how ''South Park'' had been more original in early episodes, but now had "morph[ed] into something whose default mode is mocking famous people in the news".<ref name="AVClub" />

[[Douglas Murray (author)|Douglas Murray]] of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' said of the episode, "I can't recommend it enough",<ref name="Murray" /> and particularly complimented the episode scenes with Buddha snorting cocaine and the South Park townspeople hiding Muhammad. Murray said, "They make the point about the absurd self-censorship and thuggish intimidation surrounding the Islamic faith better than anything else I've seen."<ref name="Murray" /> Amy Duncan of ''[[Metro (Associated Metro Limited)|Metro]]'' said it "certainly was an episode to remember". Duncan praised the story, which she said "develops with [''South Park''{{'s}}] usual rude inferences and below-the-belt remarks".<ref>{{Cite news |last=Duncan |first=Amy |title=Tom Cruise called a 'fudge-packer' by South Park |work=[[Metro (Associated Metro Limited)|Metro]] |date=April 15, 2010 |url=http://www.metro.co.uk/metrolife/821855-tom-cruise-called-a-fudge-packer-by-south-park |accessdate=April 16, 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100417091548/http://www.metro.co.uk/metrolife/821855-tom-cruise-called-a-fudge-packer-by-south-park| archivedate= 17 April 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Ryan Broderick of ''The Hofstra Chronicle'' said the episode "came together so simply, so smoothly, and so hilariously that it forgives the last couple lame duck episodes of the season".

The [[Council on American-Islamic Relations]], a Washington, D.C.-based civil rights and advocacy group, said they were aware of the depiction of Muhammad in "200", but declined to put out a formal statement about it because they did not want to draw any more attention to the show.
