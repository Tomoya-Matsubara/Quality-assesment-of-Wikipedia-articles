The '''United Kingdom general election of December 1910''' was held from 3 to 19 December. It was the last British election to be held over several days<ref>[http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/briefings/snpc-04512.pdf General Election Dates 1832<U+2013>2005], [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]</ref> and the last to be held prior to the [[World War I|First World War]] (1914<U+2013>18).

The [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]], led by [[Arthur Balfour]] with their [[Liberal Unionist Party|Liberal Unionist]] allies, and the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberals]], led by [[H. H. Asquith]], could not break the deadlock produced in the [[United Kingdom general election, January 1910|January general election]], with the Conservatives again winning the largest number of votes. The Liberal Party under Asquith formed a government with the support of the [[Irish Parliamentary Party|Irish Nationalists]]. This was the last election in which the Liberals won the highest number of seats in the House of Commons.
