 |ShortSummary    = In the surprise attack by Disith, several Anatoray ships are destroyed in the opening engagement. As Guild members continue to watch the engagement from above the battlefield, they note that Minagith will fall to Disith forces. Word is also sent to the Anatoray capital that Duke Mad-thane's fleet is losing the battle, and the Anatoray emperor orders that its asset be sent to a safe place away from the Guild. As the Disith attack continues, Claus and Lavie are forced to leave the bridge, unable to give the message tube to Mad-thane directly. They also realize that the second message tube from [[List of Last Exile characters#Holly Mad-thane|Mad-thane's daughter]], Holly, was not delivered. While Mad-thane gives the order to face the Disith fleet to the last ship, Claus interrupts over the speaker system in order to read the message written by Holly expressing her wishes that her father returns home. Anatoray soldiers attempt to stop Claus and Lavie but are held back by musketeer [[List of Last Exile characters#Mullin Shetland|Mullin Shetland]]. After hearing the message and ridding himself of feeling ashamed, Mad-thane orders his fleet to withdraw. Claus and Lavie create a [[smokescreen]] for the retreating fleet with their vanship but are told by a red vanship that they are in the line of fire. At the same time, the ''Silvana'' appears in the middle of the field and fires at the pursuing Disith. Given this chance, the Anatoray fleet escapes, and the ''Silvana'' and the red vanship disappear under the clouds. Claus and Lavie return to the Mad-thane residence to bring news of the Duke's safety. They also find out that they will be starting at last position in the Norkia Cup race after missing the [[time attack]].<br/><br/>''Note:'' "Luft" is the [[German language|German]] word for "sky".

The three escape through the canals in the vanship, and Al finally realizes that Guita has already died. The fighter discovers them near the end of the canal and damages the vanship, forcing an emergency landing at the temple ruins outside Norkia.

Claus and Lavie catch up to the ''Silvana'', but it opens fire on their vanship as they attempt to board.

Before Claus can answer, they are interrupted by approaching Guild fighters. The ''Silvana'', unable to effectively defend itself, is boarded by several fighters.

After observing Claus complete a [[The Scissors|Scissors]] and an [[Immelmann turn]], Dio dubs him as "[[Max Immelmann|Immelmann]]" and decides to enter the battle as well with Lucciola. However, instead of shooting down Claus and Lavie, Dio toys with them to point where he achieves a lock on them before disengaging and repeats the process several times. Lavie, who finds herself fearful of being killed, experiences a [[redout]] when Claus attempts to escape from Dio's fighter. Midway through the battle, Tatiana returns to find the ''Silvana'' under attack and also engages Dio's fighter. Lucciola disconnects his fighter from Dio's and begins to engage Tatiana. Dio decides to stop playing with Claus, but all Guild forces are recalled before he is able to fire on the next target lock.

 |ShortSummary    = The ''Silvana'' arrives at the station ''Casino Royale'' for repairs, and its crew is given temporary [[shore leave]]. At the station, Lavie once again meets Mullin Shetland, who resigned his commission on the ''Claimh Solais'' after the battle at Minagith and intends on joining the battleship ''Goliath'', also docked at the station. While Alvis is asleep, Claus also decides to look around the station and meets Tatiana's navigator, [[List of Last Exile characters#Alister Agrew|Alister Agrew]]. Mullin introduces himself to Earl Knowles of the ''Goliath'' who ridicules Mullin for being a coward by wearing his survival medals. In the final bird race of the evening, the ''Goliath'' crew manipulates the field to allow its favored bird to win. Upon seeing this, Lavie becomes angry and accuses them of cheating. The ''Silvana'' crew uses this as an excuse to get into a fight with the ''Goliath'' crew. In the meantime, station owner Walker informs Alex Row that an object related to the ''Exile'' is being auctioned in the [[black market]] under the guise of a vanship race. Mullin reveals that the ''Goliath'' escaped from the battle at Minagith without putting a fight, to which Knowles takes offense and threatens to kill him. Walker breaks up the fight, but Knowles challenges Alex to a ship-to-ship duel. When both ships leave dock, Knowles realizes that he has challenged the invincible ''Silvana'' and orders his ship to begin firing before the duel has commenced. Unscathed, the ''Silvana'' returns fire with its newly installed weapon and sinks the ''Goliath'' in one volley.

 |ShortSummary    = When Mullin offers to help Claus and Lavie repair their vanship, he is recruited to join the ''Silvana'' flight deck crew as a mechanic. After finding out from Sophia that the ''Silvana'' is en route to Horizon Cave, Claus and Lavie decide to take a rare opportunity to participate in its famous eight-hour [[Endurance racing (motorsport)|endurance race]]. Participants are assigned vanships by lottery and must make them airworthy in time for the race. Tatiana, who also joins the race with Alister, objects to working with Claus and Lavie, but Alex ignores her protests. As the race is about to begin, Sophia briefs Tatiana and Alister on their mission for the race. Dio finally introduces himself and Lucciola as a race challenger to Claus and Lavie, who do not welcome their presence. At the start of the race, Claus's and Lavie's vanship refuses to start, and they are forced to join race several seconds late. Dio provokes Tatiana into a head-to-head race despite Alister's attempts to remind her of their true objective. As the black market [[auction]] begins, Duke Henry Knowles joins Alex and notices his disinterest towards the initial items up for bid. However, as the final item of the auction, an artifact believed to lead to the gateway of the legendary ''Exile'', is introduced, Alex opens the bid with a surprising 10 million Claudia.<br/><br/>''Note:'' In this episode, Alex Row brings several strategies into play, just as a chess player [[Glossary of chess#Calculate|calculates]] his or her moves in anticipation of the opponent's future move.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.jvcmusic.co.jp/m-serve/last-exile/entry/words_9.html | title = Episode 9 Words | publisher = [[JVC]] | language = Japanese | accessdate = 2009-08-01}}</ref>

As Alex attempts to outbid the others, Guild Maestro [[List of Last Exile characters#Delphine Eraclea|Delphine Eraclea]] challenges him and finally raises the bid price to 50 billion Claudia, at which point one of Knowles's men puts a gun at the back of Alex's back threatening him not to continue bidding. On their final [[pit stop]], Tatiana and Alister pick up a cargo of explosive charges for their mission. When the auction ends, Duke Knowles takes Alex outside and reveals to him that he wants to avenge the death of his son, captain of the ''Goliath''. Claus and Lavie pull ahead of Dio and Lucciola in the final lap of the race after only filling part of their fuel tank at the last pit stop to lighten the vanship and win the race. At precisely midnight, the explosive charges dropped by Tatiana and Alister destroy Horizon Cave's power generators, leaving it in darkness. Given this opportunity, Alex kills Knowles's men and escapes. When the artifact is taken to Delphine, it is discovered to be fake. Instead, the true artifact of ''Exile'' is revealed to be a Mysterion, one of four phrases with corresponding answers that will reveal the secret of ''Exile''. Graf, the butler of House Hamilton, entrusts Alvis and the Mysterion to Alex. After the race, Lavie tells Claus that she does not want to fly in a fighter vanship but will continue to serve as a mechanic for him. Claus understands her decision and makes a promise that they will fly together again to cross the Grand Stream.

 |ShortSummary    = Tatiana and Claus are forced to make an emergency landing after their vanship hit the ''Urbanus''. Claus, who remains optimistic that the ''Silvana'' and its crew are intact, attempts to repair the vanship but cannot bring its engine to generate enough power. Tatiana, in despair for losing Alister, cannot feel the same way as him about their circumstances. Meanwhile, an evacuation is underway in Disith, but some ships experience difficulty in generating enough lift and are destroyed when they crash back to the ground. Tatiana reveals to Claus that House Wisla is one of the noble families left behind because they are too poor to move into new urban areas and have been abandoned by the Anatoray government. Although once reaching the top of her class in the military academy, she was eventually forced to discontinue her studies. Tatiana also realizes that Claus and Lavie are the children of Hamilcar Valca and Georges Head, respectively, the vanship courier duo who attempted to cross the Grand Stream to deliver a peace proposal to Disith ten years prior. Claus is finally able to give the vanship enough lift to glide across the land, and the two make their way to one of the ''Silvana'''s secret shelters. When they arrive, Claus and Tatiana find themselves captured by Disith soldiers. They are able to escape when the female soldier guarding them rushes to the arriving Disith migration capsules. However, the soldier finds that none of the capsules carrying civilians made the journey.<br/><br/>''Note:'' An [[isolated pawn]] in chess has no pawn of the same color on an adjacent tile and is cut off from support.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.jvcmusic.co.jp/m-serve/last-exile/entry/words_13.html | title = Episode 13 Words | publisher = [[JVC]] | language = Japanese | accessdate = 2009-08-01}}</ref>

Their fathers, Hamilcar Valca and Georges Head, immediately became best friends and teamed up as a vanship pilot and navigator. Claus's mother, Justina, took care of Lavie, whose mother died upon giving birth, as if she were her own daughter. Valca and Head taught their children how to fly a vanship and assigned them mock courier missions.

When Anatoray Prime Minister Marius learns that the ''Silvana'' has completed its repairs, he decides to keep the news from the Emperor. When Dio shows Claus a photo of his and Lavie's fathers, he goes to confront Alex to find out why he has the photo.

He recounts how his fianc<U+00E9>e, Euris, and Claus's and Lavie's fathers died and the memory of seeing Delphine smiling when he flew away from the Grand Stream.

After receiving a [[pigeon post]] from Marius warning of the Emperor's actions, Sophia reveals herself as Princess of Anatoray and heir to the throne.

The alliance fleet loses one-quarter of its ships after ''Exile'' continues to indiscriminately attack nearby ships, but Sophia orders it to [[Attrition warfare|continue at all costs]] in order to defeat the Guild. In the Grand Stream, Dio pursues Claus's vanship and relives the race in the Horizon Cave. However, when he realizes Lucciola is not with him, Dio falls into despair and is thrown off his vanship by a gust of wind. As the alliance fleet falters in its attack, the ''Urbanus'' leads the remaining ships in protecting the ''Silvana'' as it makes a final attack at Delphine's ship. Alex, who remains a prisoner of Delphine, catches her off-guard and strangles her before breaking her neck. As the ''Silvana'' destroys Delphine's ship, Wina hears Alex's final words at her listening post. Claus and Lavie finally cross the Grand Stream into Disith, completing the feat that their father could not achieve. There, they find the remaining alliance fleet and bring Alvis to ''Exile''. Claus recites all four Mysteria, to which Alvis responds, and ''Exile'' sheds its defensive cocoon to reveal a [[starship]]. Inside the ship, Claus and Lavie find their father's vanship and remains. The world they have been living in is revealed to be in the shape of an [[hourglass]], and ''Exile'' takes Claus, Lavie, and many others to a new world to begin a new society. On the new world, Claus and Lavie are reunited with Dunya and Mullin, who has recovered from his injuries. They are joined by Alvis, Tatiana, Alister, Holly Mad-thane, and several children.<br/><br/>''Note:'' A chess player can [[Glossary of chess#Resign|resign]] to concede loss of a match in anticipation of a [[checkmate]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.jvcmusic.co.jp/m-serve/last-exile/entry/words_26.html | title = Episode 26 Words | publisher = [[JVC]] | language = Japanese | accessdate = 2009-08-02}}</ref>
