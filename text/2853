'''Orion''' ([[Ancient Greek language|Greek]] {{polytonic|<U+1F68><U+03C1><U+03AF><U+03C9><U+03BD>}} or {{polytonic|<U+1F68><U+03B1><U+03C1><U+03AF><U+03C9><U+03BD>}}, [[Latin language|Latin]] ''Orion'')<ref>The Latin transliteration  ''Oarion'' of {{polytonic|<U+1F68><U+03B1><U+03C1><U+03AF><U+03C9><U+03BD>}}  is found, but is quite   rare.</ref> in [[Greek mythology]],  was a great huntsman who was placed among the stars as the  [[Orion (constellation)|constellation of Orion]]. He is described as a great hunter in the ancient Greek epic, the [[Odyssey]], when [[Ulysses]] meets him in  the [[underworld]]. The bare bones of  his story are told by the Hellenistic and Roman collectors of myths, but there is no record of him comparable to that of other Greek heroes, such as [[Jason]] in  the [[Argonautica]] of [[Apollonius of Rhodes]] or in Euripides' ''[[Medea (play)|Medea]]''.  The remaining fragments of legend have provided a fertile field for speculation about the prehistory of Greek myth. 

Ancient sources  tell several different stories about Orion. There are two major versions  of his birth and three or four major versions of his death. The major recorded episodes are his birth somewhere in [[Boeotia]], his visit to [[Chios]] where he met [[Merope]] and was blinded by her father, [[Oenopion]], the recovery of his sight at [[Lemnos]], his hunting with [[Artemis]] on Crete,  his death by the blow of Artemis or of the giant scorpion which became  [[Scorpius|Scorpio]], and his elevation to the heavens. Most  ancient sources omit some of these episodes and several tell only one. These incidents may  originally have been independent, unrelated  stories and it is impossible to tell whether omissions are simple brevity or represent a real disagreement.

Orion served several roles in ancient Greek culture. The story of the adventures of Orion, the hunter, is the most supported (and that not very well). He is also the personification of the constellation Orion. In addition, he was venerated as a [[Greek hero cult|hero]], in the Greek sense,  in the region of  [[Boeotia]] and there is one [[etiology|etiological]] passage which says that Orion was responsible for the present shape of the Straits of [[Sicily]].

==Legends== 
===Homer and Hesiod===
Orion is mentioned in the oldest surviving works of Greek literature, which probably date back to the seventh or eighth century BC. In [[Homer]]'s   [[Iliad]], Orion is described as a constellation; and the star  [[Sirius]] is mentioned as his dog.<ref>Il.[http://perseus.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Hom.+Il.+18.388 <U+03A3> 486<U+2013>489], on the shield of Achilles, and [http://perseus.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Hom.+Il.+22.1 <U+03A7> 29], respectively. </ref> In the [[Odyssey]], Ulysses sees him hunting  in the underworld with a bronze club, a great slayer of animals; he is also mentioned as a constellation as the lover of the [[Eos|Goddess Dawn]]&mdash;slain by [[Artemis]]&mdash;and as the most handsome of the earthborn.<ref><U+03BB> 572<U+2013>577 (as a hunter); <U+03B5> 273<U+2013>275, as a constellation (=  <U+03A3> 487<U+2013>489); <U+03B5> 121<U+2013>124; <U+03BB> 572<U+2013>77; <U+03BB> 309<U+2013>310; Rose, p.117, notes that he never identifies the hunter and the constellation, and suggests that they were not originally the same.</ref> In the ''[[Works and Days]]'' of [[Hesiod]], Orion  is also a constellation, one  whose rising and setting with the sun is used to reckon the year.<ref>ll. 598, 623</ref>
<span id="Seiter painting"/>[[Image:Diane aupr<U+00E8>s du cadavre d'Orion.jpg|thumb|Daniel Seiter's 1685 painting of Diana over Orion's corpse, before he is placed in the heavens.]]
The legend of Orion was first told in full in Hesiod's ''Astronomy''. This no longer exists, but a Hellenistic writer on the constellations has given a fairly long summary.<ref> [[Eratosthenes]], ''[[Catasterismi]]''; translation in {{gutenberg|no=348|name=Hesiod, the Homeric Hymns, and Homerica by Hesiod|author=Evelyn-White, Hugh G.|year=1914}} Whether these works are actually by Hesiod and Eratosthenes themselves is doubtful.</ref> According to this version, Orion was the son of the sea-god [[Poseidon]] and Euryale, daughter of  [[Minos]], King of Crete.  Orion could walk on the waves and went to the island of [[Chios]] where he got drunk and attacked [[Merope]], daughter of [[Oenopion]], the  ruler there. Oenopion blinded him and drove him away. He then went to [[Lemnos]] where [[Hephaestus]], the lame smith-god, had his forge. Hephaestus  told his servent, [[Cedalion]], to guide Orion to the uttermost East where [[Helios]], the Sun, healed him. Then Orion carried Cedalion around on his shoulders. Orion  returned to Chios to punish Oenopion but instead he hid away underground. Orion next went to [[Crete]] and hunted with the goddess [[Artemis]] and [[Leto]], her mother, and threatened to kill every beast on Earth. Earth objected and sent a giant scorpion to kill him instead. After his death, the goddesses asked  [[Zeus]] to place Orion among the constellations and he consented, adding the 
[[Scorpius|Scorpion]] as a memorial.<ref>[[Scorpion]] is the type of creature, Greek <U+03C3><U+03BA><U+03BF><U+03C1><U+03C0><U+03AF><U+03BF><U+03C2>, not a proper name. The constellation is called [[Scorpius (constellation)|Scorpius]] in  astronomy; colloquially, [[Scorpio (astrology)|Scorpio]], like the related astrological sign <U+2014> both are Latin forms of the Greek word. Cicero used ''Nepa'', the older Latin word for scorpion.</ref>

===Other sources===
Although Orion is referred to in Homer and Hesiod, most of the stories about him are recorded in incidental allusions and in fairly obscure later writings. No great poet standardized the legend.<ref>Rose, p.116<U+2013>117</ref> The ancient sources for Orion's legend are mostly notes in the margins of ancient poets ([[scholia]]) or  compilations by later scholars, the equivalent of modern reference works or encyclopedias. Even the legend from Hesiod's ''Astronomy'' survives only in one such compilation.  In several cases, although the surviving work  bears the name of a famous scholar,  such as [[Apollodorus of Athens]], [[Eratosthenes]], or [[Gaius Julius Hyginus]], what survives is often an ancient forgery or an abridgement of the original compilation by a later writer of dubious competence.<ref>''OCD''. Under "Apollodorus of Athens (6)" it describes the [[Bibliotheca]] as an uncritical forgery some centuries later than Apollodorus; it distinguishes "Hyginus (4)", the author of the ''Fabulae'' and ''Astronomy'', from "Hyginus (1)", (C. Julius) adding of the former that the "absurdities" of this "abbreviated" compilation are "partly due to its compiler's ignorance of Greek." Under "Eratosthenes", it dismisses the surviving ''Catasterismi'' as pseudo-Eratosthenic. Editors of these texts suggest that they may have  borne the names of great scholars because they were abridgments, or even pupil's notes, based on them. See Frazer's Loeb Apollodorus, and Condos's translation of the other two (as ''Star myths of the Greeks and Romans'' Phanes, 1997, ISBN   1890482927 </ref> The margin of the Empress [[Aelia Eudocia|Eudocia]]'s copy of the Iliad has a note summarizing a Hellenistic poet<ref>[[Euphorion of Chalcis]], who wrote in the second century BC. The MS is Allen's [[Venetus A]], scholion to <U+03A3> 486 Dindorf ''Scholia in Iliadem'' II, 171, l.7-20; Erbse's Scholia at line cited (Vol.4) </ref> who tells a different story of Orion's birth.  Here the gods [[Zeus]], Hermes and Poseidon  come to visit   [[Hyrieus]] of [[Tanagra]], who roasted  a whole bull for them.<ref>The ancient sources for this story all phrase it so that this could be either a bull or a cow; translations vary, although "bull" may be more common. A bull would be an appropriate sacrifice to male gods.</ref>  When they offered him a favor, he asked for the birth of sons. The gods took the bull's hide and ejaculated, or urinated, into  it<ref>Both are represented by the same Greek participle, ''ourion'', thus explaining Orion's name. The Latin translations by Hyginus are ambiguous. Ejaculation of semen is the more obvious interpretation here, and Kerenyi assumes it; but [[John Peter Oleson]] argued, in the note to p.28 of [http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0002-9475%28197621%2997%3A1%3C22%3AAPPBFT%3E2.0.CO%3B2-K   A Possible Physiological Basis for the Term urinator, "diver"] (''The American Journal of Philology, Vol. 97'', No. 1. (Spring, 1976), pp. 22-29) that urination is intended here; Robert Graves compares this to a African raincharm including urination, as mentioned below. 
</ref> and buried it in the earth, then told him to dig it up ten months<ref>Literally, [[lunation]]s; the Greeks spoke of ten lunations as the normal term for childbirth</ref> later. When he did, he found Orion. This explains why Orion is earthborn.<ref>''Euforion de Calcis; Fragmentos y Epigramas'', ed. Luis Alberto de Cuenca. Madrid, 1976. fr. 127, pp.254<U+2013>255. </ref>

A second full telling (even shorter than the summary of Hesiod) is in a Roman-era collection of myths based largely on the mythologist and poet [[Pherecydes of Leros]]. Here Orion is described as earthborn and  enormous in stature. (This version also mentions Poseidon and Euryale as his parents.) It adds a first marriage to [[Side]] before his marriage to Merope. All that is known about Side is that [[Hera]] threw her into [[Hades]] for rivalling her in beauty. It also gives a  different version of Orion's death than the [[Iliad]]:  [[Eos]], the Dawn, fell in love with Orion and took him to [[Delos]] and Artemis slew him there.<ref>The ''[[Bibliotheke]]'' [http://perseus.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Apollod.+1.4.3 1.4.3<U+2013>1.4.5]. This book has come down to us with the name of [[Apollodorus]]; but this is almost certainly wrong. Pherecydes from Fontenrose, [[#References|''op.cit.'']], p.6 </ref>

Another narrative, three paragraphs, is by a Latin writer on the constellations whose brief notes have come down to us under the name of Hyginus.<ref>"Hyginus", ''de Astronomia'' 2.34; a  shorter recension in his ''Fabulae'' 195. Paragraphing according to [[Ghislane Vir<U+00E9>]]'s 1992 [[Teubner]] edition. Modern scholarship holds that these are not the original work of Hyginus either, but  latter condensations: a teacher's, possibly a student's, notes.</ref> It begins with the oxhide story of Orion's birth, which this source ascribes  to [[Callimachus]] and Aristomachus, and sets the location at [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]] or Chios.<ref> Aristomachus of Soli wrote on bee-keeping. (''OCD'': "Bee-keeping".</ref> Hyginus has two versions. In one of them he omits Poseidon;<ref>In the ''Astronomia;'' the ''Fabulae'' have Poseidon.</ref> one modern critic suggests this is the original version.<ref>Fontenrose, [[#References|''op.cit.'']]</ref> This source tells two stories of the death of Orion. The first says that because of his "living joined in too great a friendship" with Oenopion he boasted to Artemis and [[Leto]] that he could kill anything which came from Earth. Earth objected and created the Scorpion.<ref>''prope nimia conjunctum amicitia vixisse, 2.26''. Hyginus, ''Ast., loc. cit.'' </ref> In the second story, [[Apollo]] objected to Artemis's love for Orion, and (seeing Orion swimming with just his head visible) challenged his sister to shoot at that mark, which she hit and killed him.<ref>''Ibid'' 2.34, quoting Istrus. Robert Graves adds that Apollo challenged Artemis to hit "that rascal [[Candaon]]"; this is for narrative smoothness. It's not in his source. </ref> The same source connects Orion with several constellations, not just Scorpio. Orion  chased [[Pleione]], the mother of the [[Pleiades]], for seven years, until Zeus intervened and raised all of them to the stars.<ref>2.21</ref> In the ''Works and Days'',  Orion chases the Pleiades themselves. [[Canis Minor]] and [[Canis Major]] are his dogs, the one in front is called [[Procyon]]. They chase [[Lepus (constellation)|Lepus]], the hare, although Hyginus says some critics thought this too base a prey for the noble Orion and have him pursuing [[Taurus (constellation)|Taurus]] instead.<ref>Hyginus, ''Astr.'' 2.33, 35<U+2013>36; which also present these as the dogs of [[Procris]].</ref>  A Renaissance mythographer adds other names for Orion's dogs: [[Leucomelaena]], [[Maera]], [[Dromis]], [[Cisseta]], [[Lampuris]], [[Lycoctonus]], [[Ptoophagus]], [[Arctophonus]].<ref>Natalis Comes, p. 457/II 752. Whatever his interpretations, he is usually scrupulous about citing his sources, which he copies with "stenographic accuracy". Here, however, he says merely ''commemorantur'', ''adderunt'', which have the implied subject "ancient writers". The dog's names mean "White-black" (or perhaps "gray"); Sparkler; Runner;  Yearned-for; Shining; Wolf-slayer; Fear-eater(?); Bear-slayer.</ref>

===Variants===
There are numerous variants in other authors. Most of these are incidental references in poems and [[scholia]]sts. The Roman poet [[Vergil]] shows  Orion as a giant wading through the [[Aegean Sea]] rather than walking on the top of it.<ref>''[[Aeneis]]'' [http://perseus.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Verg.+A.+10.755 10, 763<U+2013>767]</ref> There are several references to Hyrieus as the father of Orion that connect him to various places in [[Boeotia]], including [[Hyria]]; this may well be the original story (although not the first attested), since Hyrieus is presumably the [[eponym]] of Hyria. He is also called [[Oeneus]] although he is not the Calydonian Oeneus.<ref>Pack, p.200; giving Hyginus's etymology for Urion, but describing it as "fantastic". Oeneus from Kerenyi ''Gods'', citing [[Servius]]'s [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Serv.+A.+10.763 note] to [[Aeneid]] 10.763; which actually reads Oenopion; but this may be corruption. </ref> Other ancient scholia say, like Hesiod, that Orion was the son of Poseidon and his mother was a daughter of Minos; but they call the daughter Brylle or Hyeles.<ref> Mulryan and Brown, trans. of Natalis Comes,  Vol II, p. 752. ''n'' 98. Cites ''Scholia in Aratum Vetera'' 322 (ed. Martin, Stuttgart, 1974; sch. to Hesiod, ''Op.'' Fr. 63. Gaisford, ''PMG''1:194, respectively</ref> There are two versions of how Artemis killed Orion, either with her arrows or by producing the Scorpion. In the second variant, Orion died of the Scorpion's sting as he does  in Hesiod. Although Orion does not defeat the Scorpion in any version, several variants have it die from its wounds.  Artemis is given various motives. One is that Orion  boasted of his beast-killing and challenged her to a contest with the [[discus]]. Another is he assaulted  either Artemis or the [[Hyperborean]] maiden [[Opis]] in her band of huntresses.<ref>Apollodorus, ''loc. cit.'' and Frazer's notes. Artemis is called Opis in [[Callimachus]] [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Call.+H.+3+hymns+3.170 Hymn 3.204''f''] and elsewhere. Fontenrose p. 13. </ref> [[Aratus]]'s brief description, in his ''Astronomy'', conflates the elements of the myth. According to Aratus, Orion attacks Artemis while hunting on ''Chios'', and the Scorpion kills him there.<ref>Aratus, ''Phaenomena'' I, 634<U+2013>646. quoted in Kubiak, p. 14.</ref> [[Nicander]], in his ''Theriaca'', has the scorpion of ordinary size, hiding under a small (''oligos'') stone.<ref>Nicander, ''Theriaca'', lines 15-20.</ref>  Most versions of  the story that continue after Orion's death tell of the gods raising Orion and the Scorpion to the stars, but even here there is a variant: Ancient poets differed greatly as to who  [[Aesculapius]] brought back from the dead;<ref>Zeus slew Aesculapius for his presumption in raising the dead, so there was only one subject.</ref> the Argive epic poet [[Telesarchus]] is quoted as saying in a scholion  that Aesculapius resurrected Orion.<ref>[[Pherecydes of Athens]] ''Testimonianze i frammenti'' ed. Paola Dolcetti 2004; frag. 160 = 35a ''Frag. Hist. Gr'' = 35 Fowler. She quotes the complete scholion (to Euripedes, ''Alcestis'' 1); the statement of Telesarchus may or may not be cited from Pherecydes.</ref> Other ancient authorities are quoted anonymously that Aesculapius healed Orion after he was blinded by Oenopion.<ref> in a scholion to Pindar ''Pyth'' 3, as cited by Fontenrose, p. 26<U+2013>27, n.9</ref>

The story of Orion and Oenopion also varies. One source refers to Merope as the wife of Oenopion and not his daughter. Another refers to  Merope as the daughter of Minos and not of Oenopion.<ref>Kerenyi, ''Gods of the Greeks'' 201<U+2013>204; for Merope as the wife of Oenopion, he cites the scholiast on [[Nicander]], ''Theriaca'' 15. Frazer's notes to Apollodorus ''loc.cit.'' (Loeb)</ref> The longest version (a page in the Loeb) is from a collection of melodramatic plots drawn up by an Alexandrian poet for the Roman [[Cornelius Gallus]] to make into Latin verse.<ref>[[Parthenius]], ''Love Romances'' XX; [[LCL]], with Longus' [[Daphnis and Chloe]]. Unlike most of Parthenius' stories, no source is noted in the MS.</ref> It describes Orion as slaying the wild beasts of Chios and looting the other inhabitants to make a bride-price for Oenopion's daughter who is  called A<U+00EB>ro or Leiro.<ref>Both are emendations of Parthenius's text, which is Haero; ''A<U+00EB>ro'' is from Gaselee's Loeb editon;  ''Leiro'' "lily" Is from J. L. Lightfoot's 1999 edition of Parthenius, p.495, which records the several emendations suggested by other editors, which include Maero and Merope. "Leiro" is supported by a Hellenistic inscription from Chios, which mentions a ''Liro'' as a companion of Oenopion.</ref> Oenopion does not want to marry her  to someone like Orion, and eventually Orion, in frustration, breaks into her bedchamber and rapes her. The text implies that Oenopion blinds him on the spot.

[[Image:Orion constellation Hevelius.jpg|thumb|[[Johannes Hevelius]] drew the Orion constellation in ''Uranographia'', his celestial catalogue in 1690]] [[Lucian]] includes a picture with Orion in a rhetorical description of an ideal building in which Orion is  walking into the rising sun with  Lemnos, Cedalion on his shoulder, nearby. He recovers his sight there with Hephaestus still watching in the background.<ref>[[Lucian]], ''De domo'' 28; [[Poussin]] followed this description, and  [[A. B. Cook]] interprets all the mentions of Orion being healed by the Sun in this sense. ''Zeus'' I, 290 ''n''. 3 Fontenrose sees a combination of two stories: the lands of Dawn in the far east; and Hephaestus' smithy, the source of fire.</ref> 
:''The next picture deals with the ancient story of Orion. He is blind, and on his shoulder carries Cedalion, who directs the sightless eyes towards the East. The rising Sun heals his infirmity; and there stands Hephaestus on Lemnos, watching the cure.<ref>[[Henry Watson Fowler|Fowler, H. W.]] & [[Francis George Fowler|Fowler F.G.]] translators (1905).

Latin sources add that Oenopion was the son of Dionysus.  Dionysus sent [[satyr]]s to put Orion into a deep sleep so he could be blinded. One source tells the same story but converts Oenopion into [[Minos]] of Crete. It adds that an oracle told Orion that his sight could be restored by walking eastward and that he found his way by hearing the [[Cyclops]]' hammer, placing a Cyclops as a  guide on his shoulder; it does not mention Cabeiri or Lemnos <U+2014> this is presumably the story of Cedalion recast. Both Hephaestus and the Cyclopes were said to make thunderbolts; they are combined in other sources.<ref>Fontenrose  p.9<U+2013>10; citing Servius and the First [[Vatican Mythographer]], who is responsible for Minos. The comparison is Fontenrose's judgment</ref> One scholion, on a Latin poem, explains that Hephaestus gave Orion a horse. <ref>Fontenrose, p. 26<U+2013>27, n.9, citing the scholion to [[Germanicus]]'<!--yes, this is the right link--> translation of Aratus, line 331 (p 93, l.2 Breysig's edition. It is so late that it uses ''caballus'' for "horse". </ref>

[[Giovanni Boccaccio]] quotes a lost Latin writer for the story that Orion and Candiope were son and daughter of Oenopion, king of Sicily. While the virgin huntsman Orion was sleeping in a cave, Venus seduced him; as he left the cave, he saw his sister shining as she crossed in front of it. He ravished her; when his father heard of this, he banished Orion. Orion consulted an oracle, which told him that if he went east, he would regain the glory of kingship. Orion, Candiope, and their son Hippologus sailed to Thrace, "a province eastward from Sicily". There he conquered the inhabitants, and became known as the son of Neptune. His son begat the [[Dryas]] mentioned in [[Statius]].<ref>Boccaccio [[#references|''op. cit.'']] Book 11 <U+00A7>19<U+2013>21. Vol XI pp.559 l.22 <U+2013> 560 l.25, quoting [[Theodontius]], who is known almost entirely from this work of Boccaccio; he may be the Roman author of this name once cited by Servius; he may be a 9th century Campagnian; Boccaccio may have made him up.</ref>

==Cult and popular appreciation==
In Ancient Greece, Orion had a [[Greek hero cult|hero cult]] in the region of [[Boeotia]]. The number of places associated with his birth  suggest that it was widespread.<ref>A birth story is often a claim to the hero by a local shrine; a tomb of a hero is a place of veneration.</ref> Hyria, the most frequently mentioned, was in the territory of Tanagra. A feast of Orion was held at Tanagra as late as the Roman Empire.<ref>Knoeplfer, Denis.

[[Image:Fontanaduomo.JPG|thumb|right|The ''Fountain of Orion'', by 16th century sculptor [[Giovanni Angelo Montorsoli]] to a design by [[Francesco Maurolico]], commemorates Orion as a symbol of modern [[Messina, Italy|Messina]] in Italy.]]
Orion also has [[etiology|etiological]] connection to the city of [[Messina, Italy|Messina]] in Sicily.  [[Diodorus Siculus|Diodorus of Sicily]] wrote a history of the world up to his own time (the beginning of the reign of [[Augustus]]). He starts with the gods and the heroes. At the end he tells the story of Orion and the two wonder-stories of his mighty earth-works in [[Sicily]]. One tells how he aided [[Zanclus]], the founder of Zancle (the former name for Messina), by building the promontory which forms the harbor.<ref>Diodorus Siculus iv.85.1 Loeb, tr. [[C.H. Oldfather]].[http://www.theoi.com/Text/DiodorusSiculus4D.html English translation]</ref>The other, which Diodorus ascribes to Hesiod, relates that there was once a broad sea between Sicily and the mainland. Orion built the whole Peloris, the [[Punta del Faro]], and the temple to Poseidon at the tip, after which he settled in [[Euboea]]. He was then "numbered among the stars of heaven and thus won for himself immortal remembrance". <ref>[[Diodorus Siculus]] iv 85.5; the intervening passage deals with the opposite aetiology of the Straits of Messina: that Sicily was once connected to the mainland, and the sea (or an earthquake) broke them apart.

Appeciation of Orion in classical art is difficult to distinguish, and clear examples are rare.  There are several ancient Greek images of club-carrying hunters that could represent Orion,<ref>For example, [[John Beazley|Beazley, John]] and [[Humfry Payne|Payne, Humfry]] (1929).

==Interpretations==
===Renaissance===
[[Image:Infans Philosophicus tres agnoscit patres, ut Orion.png|thumb|Apollo, Vulcan and Mercury conceive Orion in an allegory of the three-fathered "philosophical child".  The artist stands at the left; Mars at right. Published in 1617.]]
Mythographers have discussed Orion at least since the [[Renaissance]] of classical learning. Renaissance interpretations were allegorical. In the 14th century, Boccaccio interpreted the oxhide story as representing human conception; the hide is the womb, Neptune the moisture of semen, Jupiter its heat, and Mercury the female coldness; he also explained Orion's death at the hands of the moon-goddess as the Moon producing winter storms.<ref>Boccaccio [[#references|''op.cit.'']], Book 11 <U+00A7>19, pp. 558 l. 30 to p.559 l.11.</ref> The 16th-century Italian mythographer [[Natalis Comes]] interpreted the whole story of Orion as an [[allegory]] of the evolution of a storm cloud: Begotten by air (Zeus), water (Poseidon), and the sun (Apollo), a storm cloud is diffused (Chios, which Comes derives from <U+03C7><U+03AD><U+03C9>, "pour out"), rises though the upper air ([[Aer|A<U+00EB>r]]ope, as Comes spells Merope), chills (is blinded), and is turned into rain by the moon (Artemis). He also explains how Orion walked on the sea: "Since the subtler part of the water which is rarefied rests on the surface, it is said that Orion learned from his father how to walk on water."<ref>Gombrich; Natalis Comes 459/II 754<U+2013>755.</ref>  Similarly, Orion's conception made him a symbol of the [[Filius philosophorum|philosophical child]], an allegory of philosophy  springing from multiple sources, in the Renaissance as in alchemical works, with some variations. The 16th-century German alchemist [[Michael Maier]] lists the fathers as Apollo, Vulcan and Mercury,<ref>Maier, Michael (1617). [http://www.levity.com/alchemy/atl46<U+2013>50.html ''Atalanta fugiens''].</ref> and the 18th-century French alchemist [[Antoine-Joseph Pernety]] gave them as Jupiter, Neptune and Mercury.<ref>Pernety (1737). ''[http://alkest.club.fr/misajourdec/opernety.htm Dictionaire Mytho-Hermetique]''.</ref>

===Modern===
Modern mythographers have seen the story of Orion as a way to access local [[folk tales]] and [[cult (religious practice)|cult]]ic practices directly without the interference of ancient high culture;<ref>see for example, Rose, p.116<U+2013>117. </ref> several of them have explained Orion through his own interpretation of Greek prehistory, and how Greek mythology represents it.    There are some points of general agreement between them; for example, that the  attack on Opis is an attack on Artemis, for Opis is one of the names of Artemis.<ref>Fontenrose, p.13 and note; but also Graves, Kerenyi and Rose, ''l.c.''</ref>

There was a movement in the late nineteenth century  to interpret all the Boeotian heroes as merely personifications of the constellations.<ref>Farnell, ''Greek Hero Cults'' p. 213; he doubts it, even of Orion.</ref>  There has come to be wide agreement since that the myth of Orion existed before there was a constellation  named for him. Homer, for example, mentions Orion, the Hunter, and Orion, the constellation, but never confused the two.<ref>Fontenrose, p. 27; Graves;  Kerenyi, ''Dionysus'', ''passim''; the observation on Homer is from Rose p.117. The early nineteenth-century mythographer [[Karl Otfried M<U+00FC>ller]] considered Orion the "only purely mythological figure in the heavens" and had also divided the myths into the original myths of the giant, and the figurative expressions of [[star lore]] after he was later identified with the constellation. [[Karl Otfried M<U+00FC>ller]]: (1844 translation by John Leitch). ''Introduction to a Scientific System of Mythology'', pp. 133<U+2013>134. Longman, Brown, Green, and Longmans.</ref> Once Orion was recognized as a constellation, astronomy in turn affected the myth. The  story of Side may well be a piece of mythical astronomy. The Greek word ''side'' means [[pomegranate]], which bears fruit while Orion, the constellation, can be seen in the night sky.<ref>Frazer's notes to Apollodorus, citing a lexicon of 1884. Fontenrose is unconvinced. </ref> Rose suggests she is connected with [[Sidae]] in Boeotia, and that the pomegranate, as a sign of the Underworld, is connected with her descent thither.<ref>Rose, p. 116</ref> The 19th-century German classical scholar [[Erwin Rohde]] viewed Orion as an example of the Greeks erasing the line between the gods and mankind. That is,  if Orion was in the heavens, other mortals could hope to be also.<ref>''Psyche'', tr. H.B.Hillis; New York, Harcourt, 1925, p.58. </ref>

The Hungarian mythographer [[Karl Ker<U+00E9>nyi]], one of the founders of the modern study of Greek mythology, wrote about Orion in ''Gods of the Greeks'' (1951). Ker<U+00E9>nyi portrays Orion as a  giant of [[Titan]]ic vigor and criminality, born outside his mother as were [[Tityos]] or [[Dionysus]].<ref>Ker<U+00E9>nyi believes the story of Hyrieus to be original, and that the pun on Orion/''ourion'' was made for the myth, rather than the other way around.</ref>  Ker<U+00E9>nyi places great stress on the variant in which Merope is the wife of Oenopion. He sees this as the remnant of a lost form of the myth in which Merope was Orion's mother (converted by later generations to his stepmother and then to the present forms). Orion's blinding is therefore parallel to that of [[Aegypius]] and [[Oedipus]].  [[Joseph Fontenrose]] wrote ''Orion : the Myth of the Hunter and the Huntress'' (1981) to show Orion as the [[type specimen]] of a variety of grotesque hero. Fontenrose views him as  similar to [[C<U+00FA>chulainn]], that is, stronger, larger, and more potent than ordinary men and the violent lover of the Divine Huntress. Orion has also been identified with [[Actaeon]], [[Leucippus (mythology)|Leucippus]] (son of [[Oenomaus]]), [[Cephalus]], [[Teiresias]], and [[Zeus]] as the lover of [[Callisto]]. Fontenrose also sees Eastern parallels in the figures of [[Aqhat]], [[Attis]], [[Dumuzi]], [[Gilgamesh]], [[Dushyanta]], and [[Prajapati]] (as pursuer of [[Ushas]]).

In ''Dionysus'' (1976), Ker<U+00E9>nyi portrays Orion as a shamanic hunting hero, surviving from  Minoan times (hence his association with Crete).  Ker<U+00E9>nyi derives Hyrieus (and Hyria) from the Cretan dialect word ''hyron'', which survives only in ancient dictionaries. It means "beehive".  From this association he turns Orion into a representative of the old mead-drinking cultures, overcome by the wine masters Oenopion and Oeneus. (The Greek for "wine" is ''oinos''.)  Fontenrose cites a source stating that Oenopion taught the Chians how to make wine before anybody else knew how.<ref>Fontenrose, p. 9, citing [[Theopompus]]. 264 GH.</ref> 

In ''The Greek Myths'' (1955), [[Robert Graves]] views  Oenopion as his perennial [[Year-King]], at the stage where the king pretends to die at the end of his term and appoints a substitute, in this case Orion, who actually dies in his place. His blindness is [[iconotropy]] from a picture of Ulysses blinding the [[Cyclops]], mixed with a purely Hellenic solar legend: the Sun-hero is captured and blinded by his enemies at dusk, but escapes and regains his sight at dawn, when all beasts flee him. Graves sees the rest of the myth as a syncretism of diverse stories. These include Gilgamesh and the Scorpion-Men, Set becoming a scorpion to kill Horus and the story of [[Aqhat]] and [[Yatpan]] from [[Ras Shamra]], as well as a conjectural story of how the priestesses  of Artemis Opis killed a visitor to their island of Ortygia. He compares Orion's birth from the bull's hide  to a West African rainmaking charm and claims that the son of Poseidon should be a rainmaker.<ref>Graves <U+00A7>41, 1<U+2013>5</ref>

The ancient Greek and Roman sources which tell more about Orion than his being a gigantic huntsman are mostly both dry and obscure. The brief passages in Aratus and Vergil are mentioned [[#Variants|above]]. [[Pindar]] celebrates the [[pancratium|pancratist]] [[Melissus of Thebes]]  "who was not granted the build of an Orion", but whose strength was heavy anyway.<ref>''[[Isthmian Odes]]'' 4.49; 3.67 for those who combine this Ode with the preceding one, also on Melissus. Quote from Race's Loeb translation.</ref>  [[Cicero]] translated Aratus in his youth; he made the Orion episode half again longer than it was in the Greek, adding the traditional Latin [[literary topos|topos]] of madness to Aratus's text. Cicero's ''Aratea'' is one of the oldest Latin poems to come down to us as more than isolated lines; this episode may have established the technique of including [[epyllion|epyllia]] in non-epic poems.<ref>Kubiak, who quotes the passage. (33.418<U+2013>435 Soubiran).</ref>   Orion is used by [[Horace]], who tells of his death at the hands of [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]]/[[Artemis]],<ref>[http://perseus.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Hor.+Carm.+3.4.1 ''Carmina'' 3.4.70]. The Roman goddess Diana was identified very early with Artemis, and her name was conventionally used to ''translate'' Artemis into Latin by Horace's time. This system of translation continued to be used, in Latin and English, up through the nineteenth century, and this article will use it for Roman poetry and for the Renaissance. So also Jupiter=Zeus; Neptune=  Poseidon, and so forth. See [[Interpretatio Romana]].</ref> and by [[Ovid]], in his [[Fasti (poem)|Fasti]] for [[May 11]], the middle day of the [[Feast of the Lemures|Lemuria]], when (in Ovid's time) Orion set with the sun.<ref>''P. Ovidii Nasonis Fastorum libri'' ed. [[Giovanni Baptista Pighi]], Turin 1973, I 261 (text, [http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/ovid/ovid.fasti5.shtml Fasti V 495<U+2013>535], [http://www.tonykline.co.uk/PITBR/Latin/OvidFastiBkFive.htm#_Toc69367925  English version]); II 97, 169 (surviving texts of actual Roman ''Fasti''; these indicate the setting of Orion, an astronomical event, but not a festival). Smith's ''[[A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities]]'', 1878 edition, p. 162  indicates that this is the setting of [[Betelgeuse]]; [[Rigel]] set on the 11th of April. (This is the very long entry on ''Astronomia'', <U+00A7> on Orion.) </ref> This is the story of Hyrieus and the three gods, but Ovid is bashful about the climax; Ovid makes Hyrieus a poor man, to make the sacrifice of an entire ox more generous. There is also a single mention in his ''[[Ars Amatoria|Art of Love]]'', as a sufferer from unrequited love: "Pale Orion wandered in the forest for Side."<ref>''[http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/ovid/ovid.artis1.shtml Ars Amatoria]'', I 731. .</ref> [[Statius]] mentions Orion four times in his ''Thebiad''; twice as the constellation, a personification of storm, but twice as the ancestor of [[Dryas]] of Tanagra, one of the defenders of Thebes.<ref>Storm in ''Thebiad'' III 27, IX 461, also ''[[Silvae]]'' I. 1.45; as ancestor (''nepos'', ''sanguinis auctor'') VIII 355, IX 843.</ref>

References since antiquity are fairly rare. At the beginning of the 17th century, the French sculptor [[Barth<U+00E9>lemy Prieur]] cast a bronze statue ''Orion et C<U+00E9>dalion'', some time between 1600 and 1611. This featured Orion with [[Cedalion]] on his shoulder, in a depiction of the ancient legend of Orion recovering his sight.<ref>[http://www.insecula.com/oeuvre/O0012195.html Orion et C<U+00E9>dalion] at insecula.com.</ref> The French artist [[Nicolas Poussin]] painted ''Paysage avec Orion aveugle cherchant le soleil'' (1658) (lit: "Landscape with blind Orion seeking the sun"), after learning of a description by the 2nd-century Greek author [[Lucian]], of a picture of Orion recovering his sight. In the painting, he combined this description with Natalis Comes's 16th century interpretation of the same scene.<ref>Gombrich; see also  [http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ho/09/euwf/hod_24.45.1.htm "Nicolas Poussin: Blind Orion Searching for the Rising Sun (24.45.1)"]</ref> The Austrian artist [[Daniel Seiter]] (active in Turin, Italy), painted ''Diane aupr<U+00E8>s du cadavre d'Orion'' (c.1685) (lit: "Diana next to the corpse of Orion"), pictured [[Orion (mythology)#Seiter painting|above]].

The English poet [[John Keats]] wrote [[Endymion (poem)|Endymion]] (1818), which includes the line ''"Or blind Orion hungry for the morn"'', thought to be inspired by Poussin. [[William Hazlitt]] may have introduced Keats to the painting&mdash;he later wrote  the essay "On Landscape of Nicholas Poussin", published in ''Table Talk, Essays on Men and Manners'' (1822).<ref>[http://www.blupete.com/Literature/Essays/Hazlitt/TableTalk/Poussin.htm On Landscape of Nicholas Poussin]. In this essay, Hazlitt gives a slight misquote from Keats: "And blind Orion hungry for the morn". [[John Keats]], ''Endymion'', II, 197. See also the editor's note in [http://books.google.com/books?id=j_gQAAAAMAAJ ''The Poems of John Keats''], ed. [[Ernest de S<U+00E9>lincourt]] ,  Dodd, Mead and company, 1905,  p.430. </ref> [[Richard Henry Horne]], writing in the generation after Keats and Hazlitt, penned the  three volume epic poem [http://books.google.com/books?id=v1YCAAAAQAAJ ''Orion''] in 1843. It went into at least ten editions and was reprinted by the [[Scholartis Press]] in 1928.<ref>National Union Catalog, v.254, p134, citing the LC copy of the 10th edition of 1874.</ref>

The Italian composer [[Francesco Cavalli]] wrote the opera, "L'Orione", in 1653.  The story is set on the Greek island of [[Delos]] and focuses on Diana's love  for Orion as well as on  her rival, Aurora.  Diana shoots Orion only after being tricked by Apollo into thinking him a sea monster&mdash;she then laments his death and searches for Orion in the underworld until he is elevated to the heavens.<ref>[http://www.musicalpointers.co.uk/reviews/liveevents/orion_cavalli.html Cavalli <U+2014> ''Orion'' venetianOpera]. Musical Pointers. Retrieved on [[2007-08-02]].</ref> The German composer [[Johann Christian Bach]] ('the English Bach') wrote an opera, "Orion, or Diana Reveng<U+2019>d", first presented at London's [[Haymarket Theatre]] in 1763. Orion, sung by a [[castrato]], is in love with Candiope, the daughter of Oenopion, King of Arcadia but his arrogance has offended Diana. Diana's oracle forbids him to marry Candiope and foretells  his glory and death. He bids a touching farewell to Candiope and marches off to his destiny. Diana allows him his victory and then kills him, offstage, with her arrow. In another aria, his mother, [[Retrea]] (Queen of Thebes), laments his death but ultimately  sees his elevation to the heavens.<ref>Ernest Warburton, "Orione", ''Grove Music'' Online ed. L.

The twentieth-century French poet [[Ren<U+00E9> Char]] found the blind, lustful huntsman, both pursuer and pursued, a central symbol as [[James Lawler]] has explained at some length in his 1978 work ''Ren<U+00E9> Char: the Myth and the Poem.''<ref>[http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0010-7484%28197923%2920%3A4%3C529%3ARC%3E2.0.CO%3B2 Review] of Lawler, ''Ren<U+00E9> Char: the Myth and the Poem.'' by Sarah N.

[[JSTOR]] link</ref>  French novelist [[Claude Simon]] likewise found Orion an apt symbol, in this case of the writer, as he explained in his ''Orion aveugle'' of 1970. Marion Perret argues that Orion is a silent link in [[T. S. Eliot]]'s ''[[The Waste Land]]'' (1922), connecting the lustful [[Actaeon]]/Sweeney to the blind [[Teiresias]] and, through Sirius, to the Dog "that's friend to men".<ref>Perret, "[http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0002-9831%28197411%2946%3A3%3C289%3AETNLAT%3E2.0.CO%3B2-V  Eliot, the Naked Lady, and the Missing Link]"; ''American Literature'', Vol. 46, No. 3.
