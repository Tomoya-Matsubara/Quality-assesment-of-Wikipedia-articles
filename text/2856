'''Vincenzo Brenna''' (1747<ref name=BIR>Lanceray, p. 37, states birth year as 1745. Contemporary historians ([[Dmitry Shvidkovsky]]) agree on 1747 (Shvidkovsky, p. 293)</ref> <U+2013> May 17, 1820) was an [[Italy|Italian]] architect and painter who was the house architect of [[Paul I of Russia]]. Brenna was hired by Paul and his spouse [[Maria Feodorovna (Sophie Dorothea of W<U+00FC>rttemberg)|Maria Fyodorovna]] as interior decorator in 1781 and by the end of 1780s became the couple's leading architect. Brenna worked on [[Pavlovsk]] and [[Gatchina]] palaces, rebuilt [[Saint Isaac's Cathedral]], and most notably created [[Saint Michael's Castle]] in [[Saint Petersburg]]. Most of his architectural works were created concurrently during Paul's brief reign (November 1796 <U+2013> March 1801). Soon after Paul was murdered in a [[Coup d'<U+00E9>tat|palace coup]] Brenna, renowned for [[fraud]] and [[embezzlement]] barely tolerated by his late patron,<ref name=L197/> retired and left Russia for an uneventful life in [[Saxony]].

Brenna never reached the level of his better known contemporaries [[Giacomo Quarenghi]], [[Charles Cameron (architect)|Charles Cameron]] and [[Vasily Bazhenov]] and was soon surpassed by his own trainee [[Carlo Rossi (architect)|Carlo Rossi]].<ref name=L208/> Nevertheless, historians [[Igor Grabar]],<ref name=L207>Lanceray, p. 207</ref> [[Nikolay Lanceray]]<ref name=L207/> and [[Dmitry Shvidkovsky]]<ref name=S294/> praised him for sincere and unrestricted [[naturalism]] of his graphic work and considered him to be the watershed between the [[Age of Enlightenment]] and [[Romanticism]] in Russian architecture.

==Family roots and training==

Brenna belonged to an old [[Ticino]] family that had split into two branches, stonemasons (Brenno) and painters (Brenni) not later than the last quarter of the 17th century. Stonemasons and [[marbling]] experts Karl Antonio and Francesco Brenno worked in 1680s in [[Salzburg]]. Karl Enrico Brenno (Brennus) carved elaborate tombs in [[Denmark]] and [[Hamburg]], but was better known for his marbling artwork at [[Fredensborg Palace|Fredensborg]], [[Christiansborg]] and [[Randers|Klausholm]] palaces. Giovanni Battista Brenno, [[stucco]] expert, worked in [[Bavaria]].<ref>Lanceray, p. 36</ref> The other branch produced three brothers Brenni (born in 1730s), [[fresco]] painters.<ref name=L37>Lanceray, p. 37</ref> Vincenzo Brenna, son of Francesco, was born in 1747<ref name=BIR/> in [[Florence]] (19th century sources list him as a native of [[Rome]], perhaps due to his signature ''Del cavalier Brenna Romano'').<ref name=L37/> It is not clear whether Vincenzo Brenna belonged to ''Brenno'' or ''Brenni'' branch.<ref name=L37>Lanceray, p. 37</ref>

Since 1767 Brenna studied crafts in the Roman workshop of [[Stefano Pozzi]] together with his better known contemporary [[Giacomo Quarenghi]]. Quarenghi, who leaned to painting, converted to architecture under Brenna's influence and later even gave Brenna, who was three years younger than Quarenghi the credit for being "my first teacher in architecture".<ref name=L38>{{lang-ru|"<U+0433>. <U+0411><U+0440><U+0435><U+043D><U+043D><U+0430> <U+044F><U+0432><U+0438><U+043B><U+0441><U+044F> <U+043F><U+0435><U+0440><U+0432><U+044B><U+043C> <U+0443><U+0447><U+0438><U+0442><U+0435><U+043B><U+0435><U+043C> <U+043C><U+043E><U+0438><U+043C> <U+0432> <U+0430><U+0440><U+0445><U+0438><U+0442><U+0435><U+043A><U+0442><U+0443><U+0440><U+0435>"}} - Lanceray, p. 38, cites (in Russian) Quarenghi's 1785 letter to [[Luigi Marchesi]], written in Italian and first published in the USSR in 1934.</ref> Brenna himself did not have luck in tangible architecture; instead, commissioned by [[Lodovico Mirri]]<ref>Fejfer et al., p. 403</ref><ref>Fejfer et al. date years of Brenna's employment in Warsaw 1780<U+2013>1783; Lanceray dates 1781<U+2013>1782.</ref> under auspices of [[Pope Clement XIII]], he surveyed the relics of Rome together with [[Franciszek Smuglewicz]].

==From Poland to Russia==
[[File:Brenna,Smuglewicz - Termi di Tito,.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Baths of Titus]] from ''Vestigia delle Terme di Tito'' by Smuglewicz, Brenna and Carloni]]
Back in Italy Brenna met [[Stanis<U+0142>aw Kostka Potocki]], a well-educated and rich amateur in need of professional artists.<ref name=D151>Du Prey, p. 151</ref> Brenna followed Potocki to Poland were he prepared two drafts of a church in [[Ujazdow]].<ref name=D152>Du Prey, p. 152</ref> He received commissions to decorate Potocki's palace in [[Natolin]], for which "compensated" himself from his patron's art collection.<ref name=D163>Du Prey, pp. 163-164</ref> The two parted in a bitter conflict; "Brenna's thievery, double-dealing and desertion of his benefactor Potocki for the future czar seem the unkindest cuts of all".<ref name=D151/> According to Lanceray, Brenna also painted [[fresco]]es in [[Warsaw]] for the king [[Stanis<U+0142>aw August Poniatowski]].<ref name=L39>Lanceray, p. 39</ref>

In the end of 1781 Russian [[heir apparent]] Paul (reigned as [[Paul I of Russia]]) and his spouse [[Maria Feodorovna (Sophie Dorothea of W<U+00FC>rttemberg)|Maria]], travelling on a [[Grand Tour]] of Europe under the thin guise of ''Comte du Nord'', noticed Brenna's work in Warsaw.<ref name=L39/> Paul, aware that [[Charles Cameron (architect)|Charles Cameron]] needed interior decorators for his [[Pavlovsk]] palace, offered Brenna employment in Pavlovsk.<ref name=L39>Lanceray, p. 39</ref> Brenna and his assistant [[Franz Labensky]] were formally hired by Maria for a starting annual salary of 200 [[Russian Ruble|roubles]].<ref name=L41>Lanceray, p. 41</ref> Most recent sources (Shvidkovsky) date Brenna's arrival in Russia as the beginning of 1784;<ref name=S283>Shvidkovsky, p. 283</ref> Lanceray described Brenna's Russian drafts dated 1783.<ref name=L85>Lanceray, p. 85</ref> 

Meanwhile, when Paul and Maria were in Europe, Cameron began displaying signs of aversion to their interference with his work.<ref name=L43>Lanceray, p. 43</ref> Court intermediaries suppressed the conflict for a while, but by 1785 Maria herself grew tired of Cameron's alleged inefficiency and warned him, through [[Count Kuchelbecker]], that he will not see any new commissions.<ref name=L42>Lanceray, p. 42</ref> Cameron's influence faded, influence of his assistants, including Brenna, rose, powered in part by the Italians' assertive, self-confident behaviour.<ref name=L43>Lanceray, p. 43</ref> Aspiring Brenna was caught in the middle of "[[battle of the palaces]]", an expensive ideological contest between Catherine and Paul "hidden from the uninitiated but known to the court".<ref name=S282>Shvidkovsky, p. 282</ref> Catherine made the first move, razing Bazhenov's [[Neo-gothic architecture|gothic]] towers of [[Tsaritsino park|Tsaritsino Palace]].<ref name=S282>Shvidkovsky, p. 282</ref> Cameron, dismissed by Paul, was the second casualty. Paul suspected him of carrying out Catherine's orders: Cameron built for him "a markedly private world", not an imperial palace.<ref name=S283>Shvidkovsky, p. 283</ref> Brenna, already Paul's trusted servant, was an ideal replacement. According to Lanceray, Paul used Brenna for visualizing his architectural fantasies as early as 1783<U+2013>1785.<ref name=L85>Lanceray, p. 85</ref> Maria also favored Brenna; in 1787 she wrote that she was "fascinated by Brenna's return to work" inherited from Cameron.<ref name=L44/> 

By 1789<ref name=L44/> (Shvidkovsky: 1786)<ref name=S283>Shvidkovsky, p.283</ref> Brenna, finally, was awarded his first tangible ''architectural'' project, remodeling of Paul's study suite in Pavlovsk.<ref name=L44>Lanceray, p. 44</ref> In 1794 Brenna was rewarded with a lot of land near to Pavlovsk palace. Paul's trusted barber Count [[Ivan Kutaisov]], another Pavlovsk landlord, became Brenna's first private customer; he commissioned a summer [[dacha]] in "medieval style".<ref name=L45>Lanceray, p. 45</ref> By this time Brenna earned 750 roubles p.a., but when Paul ascended to the throne in 1796, Brenna's salary reached 3,550 roubles.<ref name=L275>Lanceray, pp. 275-279, cites verbatim Brenna's 1802 retirement application that contains his salary history.</ref><ref>For the references, Brenna's ''opus magnum'', Saint Michael's Castle, cost 6 million roubles - Lanceray, p. 123</ref>

==Gatchina==
[[File:Gay1877.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Interiors of Gatchina Palace in 1877]]
{{further|[[Gatchina]], [[Gatchina Palace]]}}
[[Gatchina Palace]], completed by [[Antonio Rinaldi]] in 1781, became Paul's residence in 1783;<ref name=L53>Lanceray, p. 53</ref> formally, it was his property and Pavlovsk became property of Maria Fyodorovna.<ref name=L55>Lanceray, p. 55</ref> Paul associated Rinaldi's style with [[Orlov|Orlov brothers]], murderers of [[Peter III of Russia|his fathers]], and immediately launched remodeling of the palace.<ref name=L54/> Paul and Maria's private suites were redesigned in austere styling with inexpensive materials, in contrast with lavishly decorated public halls.<ref name=L58/> Until 1790 Paul lived a quiet life of a landlord, but in the last six years of Catherine's reign (1790<U+2013>1796) Gatchina became a base for Paul's private militarized party, called ''[[Gatchintsy]]'' or ''[[Ostrogoths]]''.<ref name=L54>Lanceray, p. 54</ref> 

In 1793 Brenna designed [[Connetable (Gatchina)|Connetable Square]], modelled after [[Ch<U+00E2>teau de Chantilly]]. In 1796 Paul launched construction of a military base for his trusted ''Gatchina troops''; the project, led by Brenna, also employed Bazhenov, [[Ivan Starov]], [[Andreyan Zakharov]] and [[Nikolay Lvov]], architect of the [[Priory Palace]].<ref name=L58>Lanceray, p. 58</ref> At about the same time Brenna expanded the palace itself, completing two square side wings of the palace. According to Lanceray's studies of archived architectural drawings, initially Paul instructed Brenna to design these wings as single-story buildings, then two storey, and finally three storey, level with Rinaldi's central core.<ref>Lanceray, pp. 61-62</ref>  Archive evidence does not allow reliable attribution of other Gatchina buildings to Brenna;<ref name=L84>Lanceray, p. 84</ref> after Paul's ascension he retained overall management over Gatchina project, but spent most time working on Saint Michael's Castle. 

Brenna also completed a series of new, at time [[Capriccio (painting)|fantastic]], palace drafts reflecting Paul's visions.<ref>Lanceray, pp. 79-84</ref> Some of these drafts, dated 1783<U+2013>1785, are direct predecessors of Saint Michael's Castle; according to Lanceray, these early experiments explain the "mind-bogging fast" ({{lang-ru|<U+0443><U+043C><U+043E><U+043F><U+043E><U+043C><U+0440><U+0430><U+0447><U+0438><U+0442><U+0435><U+043B><U+044C><U+043D><U+043E> <U+0431><U+044B><U+0441><U+0442><U+0440><U+043E>}}) pace of design stage for the Castle.<ref name=L85>Lanceray, p. 85</ref>

==Pavlovsk==

{{further|[[Pavlovsk]]}}

Brenna's major additions to Pavlovsk Palace materialized after Paul's ascension to the throne; the architect prepared
drafts over the winter of 1796-1797 and work commenced in spring of 1797.<ref name=L45>Lanceray, p. 45</ref> By summer of 1799 Brenna completed expansion of Cameron's modest side wings into spacious private suites for Paul and Maria, and added new wings for their [[retinue]], nearly completing the [[circumference]] of oval [[cour d'honneur]]. However, the palace retained its open facade appearance and the circumference is evident only in plans or aerial photographs.<ref name=L46>Lanceray, p. 46</ref> Pavlovsk interiors retained, to a varying degree, signs of Cameron's style and cannot be reliably attributed to a particular architect, with the exception of empress Maria's suite unconditionally attributed to Brenna and [[Andrey Voronikhin]]'s repairs after the 1803 fire.<ref name=L47>Lanceray, pp. 47-49</ref>

[[:commons:Category:Bip fortress|Bip Fortress]], built on site of actual [[Sweden|Swedish]] forts of [[Great Northern War]], was Paul's favorite [[folly]] since 1778. Paul even listed Bip as a real fortress in the official Army register.<ref name=L52>Lanceray, p. 52</ref> Existing structure was completed by Brenna in 1797 and housed [[Russian tradition of the Knights Hospitaller|Maltese Order]] offices.<ref name=L52>Lanceray, p. 52</ref> 

Brenna also designed and built Pavlovsk residence for grand dukes [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander]] and [[Grand Duke Constantine Pavlovich of Russia|Konstantin]]. Completed in December 1798, it was originally intended for [[Friederike Dorothea of Brandenburg-Schwedt|empress Maria's mother]] and eventually became Konstantin's private residence. All of Brenna's original styling was lost in 19th century.<ref>Lanceray, pp. 50-51</ref> <!-- Another building by Brenna, diminutive Alexandrine Palace, was demolished in 1851.<ref name=P51>Lanceray, p. 51</ref> COMMENT Shvidkovsky, p. 286, attributes it to Cameron or Lvov -->

==Saint Michael's Castle==
[[File:V.Brenna, St.Mic.Castle West 1797.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Brenna's original 1797 drawing]]
{{ further | [[Saint Michael's Castle]] }}

In May 1782 Paul, ''Comte du Nord'', met [[Charles-Louis Cl<U+00E9>risseau]] in [[Ch<U+00E2>teau de Chantilly|Chantilly]]. Clerisseau, who knew he was admired by [[Catherine II of Russia|Paul's mother]], reprimanded the Russian heir for not paying him attention before and promised to report Paul's "disrespect" to Catherine. <ref name=S293>Shvidkovsky, p. 293</ref> The bitter exchange further alienated Paul from the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] Classicism [[Russian Enlightenment|practiced by Catherine]]; Paul formed an opinion of [[neoclassicism|neoclassic art]] as dry, emotionally inadequate reproduction of antiques.<ref name=S293/> Instead of [[Andre Le Notre]]'s geometric gardens, Paul embraced emerging [[romanticism]] and the English concept of [[landscape park]]s.<ref name=S293/><ref>Lanceray, p.66, notes that English parks were primarily Maria's obsession. Paul himself did not rule out regular French gardens and commissioned regular ''Dutch Gardens'' in Gatchina.</ref> According to [[Dmitry Shvidkovsky]], the architect and the emperor shared the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] vision of art; this emotional bond explains Brenna's survival at the court of an irrational tsar.<ref name=S294/>

Design and construction of Saint Michael's Castle began at least 13 times since 1784; in the end, Paul relied on Brenna and his trainee [[Carlo Rossi (architect)|Carlo Rossi]].<ref name=S294/> [[Vasily Bazhenov]] was involved in one of earlier abortive projects;<ref name=S294/> this information, incorrectly interpreted in 19th century, led to a widespread misconception that the castle was co-designed by Brenna and Bazhenov.<ref>Lanceray, pp. 29-32, tracked historiography of the Castle and linked "Bazhenov legend" to [[Metropolitan bishop]] Eugene Bolchovitinov (1845)</ref> Paul, in his usual manner, assigned Bazhenov to be Brenna's [[mentor]], but all creative and business issues were handled by Brenna alone.<ref name=L99>Lanceray, p. 99</ref> The castle turned out to be not a Neoclassical building, but "a rare example of an imperial palace genuinely redolent of the Romantic era."<ref name=S295/>

[[File:Mikhailovsky castle.JPG|thumb|200px|left|View in 1801. Watercolor by [[Giacomo Quarenghi]]]]
Paul decreed construction of the castle in November 1796, three weeks after Catherine's death. It took two months to demolish the old structures on site; [[groundbreaking]] was celebrated in February 1797<ref name=S295/><ref name=L99101>Lanceray, pp. 99-101</ref> but actual work commenced in earnest on March 11, exactly four years before Paul's murder.<ref name=L105>Lanceray, p. 105</ref> Initial cost budget reached 1.5 million roubles in gold, not including interior finishes<ref name=L103>Lanceray, p. 103</ref> 

Paul shut down Catherine's projects in [[Tsarskoye Selo]] and placed the redundant workforce at Brenna's disposal.<ref name=L104>Lanceray, p. 104</ref> He wanted to see the castle externally complete by the end of 1797, so work on site, employing up to 6,000 men, continued day at night while all other residents of Saint Petersburg were ''ordered to sleep'' after dusk.<ref name=L107>Lanceray, p. 107</ref> Indeed, walls of the castle and nearby ''Exerzierhaus'' (Riding House) were built (but not finished in stone) by the end of October 1797.<ref name=L110>Lanceray, p. 110</ref> Brenna, realizing that existing [[project management]] controls will delay completion, demanded elimination of all financial controls and intermediaries between Paul and himself. Paul agreed and allowed Brenna unchecked access to state finances;<ref name=L113>Lanceray, p. 113</ref> in the end, total cost of the Castle reached six million roubles in gold.<ref name=L123>Lanceray, p. 123.</ref> 

While Paul and Brenna spent millions on finishes and artwork, they placed unnecessary [[cost control]]s on essential works like [[roofing]] and [[Drainage|site drainage]]; the castle was topped out with an iron roof only in 1799.<ref name=L110>Lanceray, pp. 115-116</ref> The structure was declared ready for occupancy only in the beginning of 1800, fourteen months before Paul's death,<ref name=S295>Shvidkovsky, p. 295</ref> but "moving in" ceremony was delayed until November 1800.<ref name=L128>Lanceray, p. 128</ref> Moisture inside the ballroom was so high that candlelight could not break through the wall of fog; Paul and Maria left and returned to the castle only on February 1, 1801.<ref name=L129>Lanceray, p. 129</ref>  

Despite all setbacks, four year construction period was unprecedented for a large palace; contemporaries and modern historians agree that Brenna proved himself a capable project manager.<ref name=S293/><ref name=L119>Lanceray, p. 119</ref> In addition to Saint Michael's Castle, he was still responsible for works performed at [[Gatchina]], [[Pavlovsk]], [[Peterhof]] and [[Tsarskoye Selo]];<ref name=L109>Lanceray, p. 109</ref> he managed hundreds of suppliers and contractors, hired European artists, squeezed discounts out of merchants, arranged [[geology|geological]] expedition scouting for proper [[granite]] deposits.<ref name=L119>Lanceray, p. 119</ref> Unlike Cameron, Brenna never hesitated to assign less-than-competent artists to "fill the void" and make the schedule; he focused on the whole picture and did not seek perfection in detail.<ref name=L119/><ref name=L109/>

==Private life and retirement==
[[File:V.Brenna, Cazassi theater.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Antonio Casassi Theatre, Brenna's last building, stood on site of present-day [[Alexandrinsky Theatre]]]]
Little is known of Brenna's private life or even his personal appearance. The sole existing portrait of Brenna as a middle-aged man bears certain resemblance to images of Paul I, perhaps a deliberate [[flattery]].<ref name=L193>Lanceray, p.193</ref> Another idealistic image of Brenna was painted in the [[plafond]] of Saint Michael's Castle by a mediocre assistant who used the same model for [[cupid]]s and statesmen.<ref name=L194>Lanceray, p.194</ref> 

Brenna married Maria Trauenfeld, whose father was employed by [[Frederick II Eugene, Duke of W<U+00FC>rttemberg|Frederick Eugene]], father of empress Maria. Exact date of the marriage is unknown; it probably took place soon after Brenna's arrival in Russia.<ref name=L193>Lanceray, p. 193</ref> They had a daughter, who was around sixteen in 1798, and whose later life remains unknown (her name did not appear on the immigration records when Brennas left).<ref name=L198/> The Brennas maintained modest lifestyle in Pavlovsk and Gatchina until Brenna relocated to Saint Petersburg in 1796. In 1798 they moved to former Trauenfeld residence; Brenna purchased this building one month prior to Paul's murder.<ref name=L198>Lanceray, p. 198</ref> 

Brenna, as chief procurer of arts to Paul's court, amassed a remarkable collection of arts, including works by [[Michelangelo]], [[Rembrandt]] and [[Titian]].<ref name=L196>Lanceray, p. 196</ref> Brenna's unsrupulous handling of state treasury irreparably tarnished his reputation. Paul himself was aware of Brenna's misconduct and was credited with a [[pun]], in [[French language]]: "Voila l'architecte qui vole" (''voler'' can be interpreted as ''soar'' as well as ''steal'').<ref name=L197>Lanceray, p. 197</ref> [[Vladimir Stasov]] accused Brenna of physically stealing art from the [[Hermitage Museum|Hermitage collection]].<ref name=L197/> 

Brenna's last building in Saint Petersburg was a wooden theatre commissioned by [[Antonio Casassi]] in 1801; in 1832 [[Carlo Rossi (architect)|Carlo Rossi]] replaced it with present-day [[Alexandrinsky Theatre]] building. Murder of Paul (March 11, 1801) and ascension of [[Alexander I of Russia]] spelled end of Brenna's career; he was not even invited to decorate the funeral ceremonies. Alexander clearly preferred the art of Quarenghi and [[Andrey Voronikhin]].<ref name=L198/> The family council decided to leave Russia for [[Saxony]]; other Italians ([[Concensio Albani]], [[Antonio Rusca]], [[Giuseppe Sarti]]) followed, for different reasons. Brenna's wife, father in law and some of his apprentices left in May 1802. 

Brenna stayed in Saint Petersburg to settle his finances. He sold his art treasures and in January 1802 tended his resignation to Maria Fyodorovna, the latter granted him annual pension of 3525 roubles (half of his salary). Brenna also applied to Alexander for a raise, and was harshly shown to the door; his pension, awarded on assumption that Brenna would stay in Russia and be available for professional consultancy, was reduced to 2,000 roubles.<ref name=L201>Lanceray, p. 201</ref><ref>[[Nikolay Karamzin]] at the peak of his career as Alexander's official historian earned the same 2,000 roubles p.a. - {{ cite web | url=http://www.kostyor.ru/biography/?n=60 | title=N.

==Critical assessment==

Historians agree that Brenna's talent was nowhere near that of his illustrious rivals (Bazhenov, Cameron, Quarenghi) or his trainee, Carlo Rossi.<ref name=L208/> Degree of Brenna's talent or [[mediocrity]] was debated.

[[Igor Grabar]] praised Brenna for an extreme degree of [[Naturalism (arts)|naturalism]] in his artwork and considered Brenna to be the [[Drainage divide|watershed]] between naturalism of the 18th century and stylization of [[Empire style]].<ref name=S293/> [[Nikolay Lanceray]], who wrote a biography of Brenna in 1935<U+2013>1938, called Brenna "the last spark of 18th century art"<ref name=L209>Lanceray, p. 209</ref> and noted that his naturalism resurfaced in the middle of 19th century, but the [[eclecticism|eclectic]] architects of this period failed in reproducing Brenna's wholesome realism; only Rossi managed to combine the virtues of Brenna and Quarenghi.<ref name=L208/> Lanceray noted Brenna's weakness in [[floorplan]] designs, labeling them "helpless and primitive",<ref name=L208>Lanceray, p. 208</ref> and praised him for nearly perfect [[facade]]s of Saint Michael's Castle.<ref name=L208/>

[[Dmitry Shvidkovsky]] elaborated on the "watershed" theory, linking Brenna's art to his Roman studies: "No partisan of strict Antiquity like Cameron, he was able to combine the solemn image of Imperial Rome with heightened pre-Romantic emotionalism. Time almost seems sublimated in his work in Russia because of the impact of an [[Paul I of Russia|imperial patron]] who wanted a complete break with [[Catherine_II_of_Russia#Arts_and_culture|Catherinian tradition]]... Paul was the first emperor of the [[Romanticism|Romantic era]], Brenna was the precursor of Romantic Neoclassicism."<ref name=S294>Shvidkovsky, p. 294</ref>

==Brenna in fiction==

Brenna, played by [[Alexander Grigoryants]], appears in the 2003 Russian film ''Poor, Poor Pavel'' featuring [[Viktor Sukhorukov]] as Paul and late [[Oleg Yankovsky]] as [[Pyotr Alekseyevich Pahlen|Count Pahlen]]. The film is loosely based on a 1908 play ''Pavel I'' by [[Dmitry Merezhkovsky]]. 

In the film, Brenna is portrayed far younger than he actually was during Paul's reign, and bears no resemblance to the real Brenna's portrait. His calls for "more gold!" reflect real Brenna's generous use of gold paint, although the film omits the topic of Brenna's embezzlement.
