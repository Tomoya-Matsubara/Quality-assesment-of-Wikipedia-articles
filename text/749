'''Andrei Antanasovich Kanchelskis''' ({{lang-ru|<U+0410><U+043D><U+0434><U+0440><U+0435><U+0439> <U+0410><U+043D><U+0442><U+0430><U+043D><U+0430><U+0441><U+043E><U+0432><U+0438><U+0447> <U+041A><U+0430><U+043D><U+0447><U+0435><U+043B><U+044C><U+0441><U+043A><U+0438><U+0441>}}) is a retired [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] and [[Russia]]n [[association football|football]] [[midfielder]] of [[Lithuanian people|Lithuanian]] and [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] origin. He played for a number of teams, most notably [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] and [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]]. Kanchelskis is the only player in history to have scored in each of the [[Old Firm|Glasgow]], [[Merseyside derby|Merseyside]] and [[Manchester derby|Manchester]] local derbies.{{Fact|date=March 2008}} 

==Club career==
===Early career===
Kanchelskis started his career with [[FC Dynamo Kyiv|Dynamo Kyiv]] in 1988 and then went to [[FC Shakhtar Donetsk|Shakhtar Donetsk]] in 1990.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.givemefootball.com/player-profiles/andrei-kanchelskis |title=Andrei Kanchelskis |accessdate=2008-11-07 |last=Harding |first=John |work=givemefootball.com |publisher= The Professional Footballers Association }}</ref>

===Manchester United=== 
Kanchelskis signed for [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] on 26 March 1991 and made his debut in the final game of the [[1990-91 in English football|1990-91 season]], which United lost 3-0 at [[Selhurst Park]].

In [[1991-92 in English football|1991-92]], Kanchelskis enjoyed many first team opportunities and helped United win the [[Football League Cup]], although they were beaten to the [[Football League]] title by [[Leeds United A.F.C.|Leeds United]]. He proved himself as an able deputy to the considerably older [[Bryan Robson]] and [[Mike Phelan]].

In [[1992-93 in English football|1992-93]], Kanchelskis established on the right side of midfield, being a key part of the team who won the first ever [[Premier League]] title.

[[1993-94 in English football|1993-94]] brought more success as United won the [[Premier League]] title and the [[FA Cup]], and Kanchelskis was now United's first choice right-sided midfielder, and their first "proper" right-winger since [[Steve Coppell]] in the early 1980s, as the previous first-choice player in that position - [[Bryan Robson]] - was more of a right-sided midfielder.

Kanchelskis was United's leading goalscorer in the [[1994-95 in English football|1994-95 season]] with 15 goals in 32 games (14 of them in the [[Premier League]]), but missed the final few weeks of the season due to a [[hernia]] and during that time United surrendered the league title to [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn]] and the [[FA Cup]] to [[Everton F.C.|Everton]]. United were also without the suspended [[Eric Cantona]] (who was banned for eight months after he assaulted a spectator against [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] in late January), while [[Andy Cole]] was cup-tied for the [[FA Cup]] games.

Kanchelsksis had played 145 times for United and scored 48 goals in the space of four years, but he had fallen out with manager [[Alex Ferguson]] earlier in the season and felt that they could no longer work together. He was promptly put on the transfer list in early July.

===Everton===
[[Bryan Robson]] made an unsuccessful bid to sign Kanchelskis for [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] when it was announced that United would be selling him, and there was also speculation that he would sign for [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]]. In the end, Kanchelskis was sold to [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] just after the start of the [[1995-96 in English football|1995-96 season]]. The [[Pound sterling|<U+00A3>]]5&nbsp;million fee paid by manager [[Joe Royle]] made him Everton's biggest signing at the time.

His first season with the club saw him score 16 goals to cap a season of excellent performances which made him arguably the best right-winger in the country. He rapidly gained cult status with Everton fans especially after his two goals against rivals [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] at Anfield and his performances helped the club to a sixth place finish, their best finish since 1988, though it wasn't quite enough to secure a [[UEFA Cup]] place. Before Kanchelskis had been able to reproduce that form in his second season he was sold mid-way through for <U+00A3>8&nbsp;million to [[ACF Fiorentina|Fiorentina]], and it was to be six years before Everton recovered anything like the form they had been showing while Kanchelskis was in the side.

===Later career===
At Fiorentina he again struggled to find his best form and later went on to play for [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] (1998-2002), [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] (2001) (on loan), [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] (2003), [[Al-Hilal]] (2003), [[FC Saturn Moscow Oblast|FC Saturn Moscow]] (2004-2005), and [[FC Krylia Sovetov Samara|Krylia Sovetov]] (2006). Whilst playing over 70 games for the Ibrox side, he only showed glimpses of his earlier career success, and found himself yet again on the fringes of the first team. 

After leaving Krylia Sovetov he was without a contract and despite expressing interest in continuing playing, he retired on 12 February 2007.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/6354263.stm Kanchelskis calls time on career ]</ref> He played his last competitive game on 25 November 2006 in Round 30 of the Russian League.<ref>[http://rsssf.com/tablesr/rus06det.html Russia 2006 First Level - Match Details]</ref>

==International career==
Although Kanchelskis was born in Ukraine and his heritage is [[Lithuania]]n, he chose to represent [[Russia national football team|Russia]]. He was [[cap (football)|capped]] 23 times for the [[USSR national football team|Soviet Union national team]], scoring three goals, and 36 times for Russia, scoring five goals. After leading a player boycott against head coach [[Pavel Sadyrin]] and therefore missing the [[1994 FIFA World Cup]], the only senior major international tournaments Kanchelskis played in were [[1992 UEFA European Football Championship|Euro 92]] and [[1996 UEFA European Football Championship|Euro 96]].

==Post-playing career==
In 2007, Kanchelskis became the sporting director of Russian 1st division football club [[FC Nosta Novotroitsk]].

==Controversy==
In his autobiography, Managing My Life, [[Alex Ferguson]] alleged that he was offered a <U+00A3>40,000 bribe to sell Kanchelskis. When this was refused, he claimed that death threats were made to [[Martin Edwards]], the chairman of Manchester United at the time. There was no suggestion that Everton or Kanchelskis were aware of either the bribe or the threats.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/football/409526.stm Man Utd boss 'was offered bribe']</ref>
