'''Adelia Armstrong Lutz''' (June 25, 1859 &ndash; November 17, 1931) was an American artist active primarily in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.  She played a key role in organizing art circles in [[Knoxville, Tennessee]], namely through her role as director of the Knoxville Art Club and as a co-organizer of the Nicholson Art League.  Her work, which consists primarily of still lifes and portraits, was exhibited at expositions throughout the South, and is the subject of a permanent exhibit organized by the [[Knoxville Museum of Art]].

Lutz continued painting until her death in 1931.  She was initially buried in Knoxville's New Gray Cemetery, but was later reinterred at Highland Memorial Cemetery off Kingston Pike.<ref name=deaderick />   Lutz's home, Westwood, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984.
