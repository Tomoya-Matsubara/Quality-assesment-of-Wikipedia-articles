'''Assemblage 23''' is an [[electronic]] act from the [[United States]], currently based in [[Seattle]]. It was founded in 1988 by [[Tom Shear]] who writes the music, lyrics, and does the recording himself.

==History==

===1980s - 1990s (Pre-Assemblage 23)===
Prior to starting Assemblage 23, Shear experimented with music under the name Man on a Stage, beginning in the early 1980s. Most of Shear's music at this point was instrumental, as he lacked the confidence to sing; the quality of the music itself was highly questionable by his own admission. Shear eventually began to add vocals to his music; at the same time, Shear was also playing bass in a live band called the Advocates. 

Assemblage 23 was officially born in 1988, after Shear experienced the [[industrial music|industrial]] [[dance music]] played by an opening DJ for [[Depeche Mode]]. The style of this genre deeply impressed Shear; he believed he had finally found the sort of sound he wanted for his music.<ref>[http://assemblage23.com/infostart.html A23 Beginnings]</ref> Even so, the project was more of a hobby for Shear at this point; it took until 1998 for Assemblage 23 to gather enough positive acclaim to attract the attention of record labels.

===Late 1990s - early 2000===
Shear signed a deal in 1999 with the Canadian label Gashed! to for a full-length album (''Contempt'', released in November 1999). A second album, ''Failure'', followed in March 2001 and was released by Gashed in North America and Accession Records in [[Europe]]. A single from ''Failure'', "Disappoint", was released on Accession in October 2001. The song dealt with Shear's sense of loss after his father's suicide on October 28, 1999.

After falling out with Gashed Records following ''Failure'', Shear signed with US label [[Metropolis Records]] (US) later in 2001; Metropolis re-released ''Contempt'' and ''Failure'' in [[November 2001|November]].  A remix release, ''Addendum'', was also released in November only on Accession. By this point, Assemblage 23 had become fairly popular within the EBM genre; the third album, ''Defiance'', was released in October 2002 on Metropolis and Accession, preceded by the single "Document", in [[September 2002|September]] of that year.

Assemblage 23 released a fourth album, ''Storm'', in October 2004 with singles "Let the Wind Erase Me" in [[August 2004|August]] and  "Ground" in [[November 2004|November]]. 

===Mid 2000 - present===
In March 2007, Assemblage 23 released a new single, "Binary", which debuted at #21 on the Billboard US singles chart, preceding the album ''Meta'', released in April 2007.

Also in 2007 saw the release of "Early Rare & Unreleased"<ref>[http://www.side-line.com/news_comments.php?id=28440_0_2_0_C Early, rare and unreleased Assemblage 23 tracks compiled]</ref> which is a collection of 14 Assemblage 23 tracks taken from the years 1988 - 1998. In 2009, "Early Rare & Unreleased Volume Two" was released.

Assemblage 23 performed at Montreal's Kinetik Festival in May 2009. In September 2009, Assemblage 23 will release the first single from upcoming album "Compass", "Spark". Shortly after, Metropolis and Accession will release the full album in both regular and double digipak limited edition.
