'''''Babylon 5''''' is an [[United States|American]] [[science fiction on television|science fiction television series]] created, produced and [[#Writing|largely written by]] [[J. Michael Straczynski]]. The show centers on the [[Babylon 5 (space station)|Babylon 5]] [[space station]]: a focal point for politics, diplomacy, and conflict during the years 2257<U+2013>2262. With its prominent use of planned [[story arc]]s, the series was often described as a "novel for television".<ref name="soaps1">{{cite web |first=Jo-Ann |last=Parks |title=Soap Opera 'Babylon' - B5 and the Soaps |url=http://www.space.com/sciencefiction/tv/soap_opera_babylon_000317.html |work=SPACE.com |publisher=Imaginova Corp |date=2000-03-17 |accessdate=2009-10-18}}<!-- original cite {{cite web |url=http://www.space.com/sciencefiction/tv/soap_opera_babylon_000317.html |title=Soap Opera 'Babylon' |publisher=Space.com |date=2000-03-17 |accessdate=2006-09-04}} --></ref><ref name="cnn1">{{cite news |first=Dennis |last=Michael |title='Babylon 5' prepares for final bow |url=http://www.cnn.com/SHOWBIZ/TV/9811/20/babylon.5/ |work=[[CNN|CNN.com]] |publisher=Cable News Network |date=1998-11-20 |accessdate=2009-10-18}}<!-- Original cite 2 {{cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/SHOWBIZ/TV/9811/20/babylon.5/ |title="Babylon 5" Prepares For Final Bow |publisher=[[CNN]] |date=1998-11-20 |accessdate=2007-08-21}} --></ref>

The pilot film premiered on February 22, 1993. The regular series aired from January 26, 1994 and ran for five full seasons. The show spawned six television films and a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] series, ''[[Crusade (TV series)|Crusade]]'', which aired in 1999 and ran for thirteen episodes. On July 31, 2007, a [[DVD]] was released containing two short films about selected characters from the series.

== Concept ==
Having worked on a number of television science fiction shows which had regularly gone over budget, creator J. Michael Straczynski concluded that a lack of long-term planning was to blame, and set about looking at ways in which a series could be done responsibly. Taking note of the lessons of mainstream television, which brought stories to a centralised location such as a hospital, police station, or law office, he decided that instead of "[going] in search of new worlds, building them anew each week," a fixed space station setting would keep costs at a reasonable level. A fan of sagas such as the [[Foundation series|''Foundation'' series]], ''[[Childhood's End]]'', ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', ''[[Dune universe|Dune]]'' and ''[[ Lensman series]]'', Straczynski wondered why no one had done a television series with the same epic sweep, and concurrently with the first idea started developing the concept for a vastly-ambitious epic covering massive battles and other universe-changing events. Realizing that both the fixed-locale series and the epic could be done in a single series, he began to sketch the initial outline of what would become ''Babylon 5''.<ref name="GEnie-1992">{{cite web<!-- Archive URL date taken from page metadata, main URL date taken is the one used for the entire document --> |first=J.

{{Quote box |quote=Once I had the locale, I began to populate it with characters, and sketch out directions that might be interesting.

Straczynski set five goals for ''Babylon 5''. He said that the show "would have to be good science fiction" as well as good television -- "rarely are shows both good [science fiction] ''and'' good TV; there're {{sic}} generally one or the other [emphasis in original]." It would have to do for science fiction television what ''[[Hill Street Blues]]'' had done for [[police drama]]s, by taking an adult approach to the subject. It would have to be reasonably budgeted, and "it would have to look unlike anything ever seen before on TV, presenting individual stories against a much broader canvas." He further stressed that his approach was "to take [science fiction] seriously, to build characters for grown-ups, to incorporate real science but keep the characters at the center of the story."<ref name="GEnie-1991">{{cite web<!-- Note: The Google Cache archive for this cite has been removed because it is a dead link.

The idea was not to present a perfect utopian future, but one with greed and homelessness; one where characters grow, develop, live, and die; one where not everything was the same at the end of the day's events.

Instead, acting as a center of political intrigue and conflict, the station becomes the [[linchpin]] of a massive [[interstellar]] war. This is reflected in the opening monologue of each episode, which includes the words "last, best hope for peace" in season one, changing to "last, best hope for victory" by season three.

The series consists of a coherent five-year [[story arc]] taking place over five seasons of 22 episodes each. Unlike most television shows at the time, ''Babylon 5'' was conceived as a "novel for television", with a defined beginning, middle, and end; in essence, each episode would be a single "chapter" of this "novel".<ref name="JMSyousay1">{{cite web |url=http://www.jmsnews.com/msg.aspx?id=1-10170 |title=You say, 'New characters and sets... |first=J.

Though conceived as a whole, it was necessary to adjust the plotline to accommodate external influences. Each of the characters in the series was written with a "trap door" into their background so that, in the event of an actor's unexpected departure from the series, the character could be written out with minimal impact on the storyline.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.midwinter.com/lurk/misc/cc-leave.html |title=JMS on Claudia Christian's departure |accessdate=2006-11-14}}</ref> In the words of Straczynski, "As a writer, doing a long-term story, it'd be dangerous and short-sighted for me to construct the story without trap doors for every single character. ...

{{Quote box |quote=First thing I did was to flip out the stand-alones, which traditionally have taken up the first 6 or so episodes of each season; between two years, that's 12 episodes, over half a season right there. Then you would usually get a fair number of additional stand-alones scattered across the course of the season. So figure another 3-4 per season, say 8, that's 20 out of 44.

Ratings for ''Babylon 5'' continued to rise during the show's third season, but going into the fourth season, the impending demise of network [[Prime Time Entertainment Network|PTEN]] left a fifth year in doubt. Unable to get word one way or the other from parent company [[Warner Bros.]], and unwilling to short-change the story and the fans, Straczynski began preparing modifications to the fourth season in order to allow for both eventualities. Straczynski identified three primary plot-threads which would require resolution: the Shadow war, Earth's slide into a dictatorship, and a series of sub-threads which branched off from those. Estimating they would still take around 27 episodes to resolve without having the season feel rushed, the solution came when the [[Turner Network Television|TNT]] network commissioned two ''Babylon 5'' television films. Several hours of material was thus able to be moved into the films, including a three-episode arc which would deal with the background to the [[Earth<U+2013>Minbari War]], and a sub-thread which would have set up the sequel series, ''Crusade''. Further standalone episodes and plot-threads were dropped from season four, which could be inserted into ''Crusade'', or the fifth season, were it to be given the [[greenlight]].<ref name="writing"/> The intended series finale, "[[Sleeping in Light]]", was filmed during season four as a precaution against cancellation. When word came that TNT had picked up ''Babylon 5'', this was moved to the end of season five and replaced with a newly-filmed season four finale, "[[The Deconstruction of Falling Stars]]".<ref>{{cite web |title=How will this play out |author=[[J.

Human visitors to the alien sectors are shown using breathing equipment and other measures to tolerate the conditions.

=== Civilizations ===
{{Main|Civilizations in Babylon 5}}
At the beginning of the series, five dominant civilizations are represented. The dominant [[species]] are the [[Human (Babylon 5)|Humans]], [[Minbari]], [[Narn]], [[Centauri (Babylon 5)|Centauri]], and the [[Vorlon]]s. "The [[Shadow (Babylon 5)|Shadows]]" and their various allies are malevolent species who appear later in the series. Several dozen less powerful species from the [[League of Non-Aligned Worlds]] appear, including the [[Drazi]], [[Brakiri]], [[Vree]], [[Civilizations in Babylon 5#Markab|Markab]], and [[pak'ma'ra]].

While the original pilot film featured some [[Extraterrestrial life|aliens]] which were puppets and [[animatronics]], the decision was made early on in the show's production to portray most alien species as [[humanoid]] in appearance. Barring isolated appearances, fully [[Computer-generated imagery|computer-generated]] aliens were discounted as an idea due to the "massive [[rendering (computer graphics)|rendering]] power"<ref name="JMSemotion" /> required. Long-term use of puppets and animatronics was also discounted due to the technological limitations in providing convincing interaction with the human actors ("<U+2026>if you want any real ''emotion'' from the character, you're going to have to have an actor inside" [emphasis in original]).<ref name="JMSemotion">{{cite newsgroup |title=Alien looking aliens |author=[[J.

=== Languages ===
There are three primary languages used on the Babylon 5 station: English, as well as the fictional Centauri and [[Interlac]].<ref name="trans">{{cite web |title=Orange County interview |author=[[J.

 |accessdate=2007-08-16}}</ref> Other human and alien languages do exist in the ''Babylon 5'' universe, though with the exception of Minbari, hearing them spoken is uncommon; when aliens of the same species are speaking to one another, the words heard are English, though it is presumed they are speaking their native tongue. Only when in the presence of humans can the alien language be heard, to stress that the humans cannot understand what is being said.<ref>{{cite web |title=Yes, people will go to the bathroom |author=[[J.

The principal human characters speak with an American English accent, with the exception of [[Marcus Cole]], who speaks with Jason Carter's natural British English accent. Susan Ivanova, born in [[Russia]], speaks with an American accent, as her character was raised and schooled outside Russia.<ref>{{cite newsgroup |title=Diversity of B5 populace |author=[[J.

Various other minor human characters speak English with recognizable regional accents. Ambassadors Delenn and Londo Mollari, both alien characters, speak with distinct accents similar to [[Slavic languages|Slavic]]. Delenn speaks with actress [[Mira Furlan]]'s normal [[Croatian language|Croatian]] accent; most other Minbari have native-speaker accents for English (e.g. American English for Lennier, British English for [[Neroon]]). Londo's accent was developed independently by actor Peter Jurasik<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/377/377726p4.html |title=IGN: An Interview with Peter Jurasik |accessdate=2006-09-26}}</ref> and was imitated by William Forward,<ref name="Forward1"/> who played Lord Refa. Straczynski has described Londo's accent as being that of the "old school" of the Centauri Imperial Court.<ref>{{cite web |title=Re:Franklin and Ivanova |author=[[J.

== Plot summary ==
{{Babylon5TVMovies}}
{{Main|List of Babylon 5 episodes}}
The five seasons of the series each correspond to one fictional sequential year in the period 2258<U+2013>2262. Each season shares its name with an episode that is central to that season's plot. As the series starts, the Babylon 5 station is welcoming ambassadors from various races in the galaxy. Earth has just barely survived an accidental war with the powerful [[Minbari]], who, despite their superior technology, mysteriously surrendered at the brink of the destruction of the human race (the [[Battle of the Line]]).

=== Season 1 <U+2013> year 2258 ===
{{Main|List of Babylon 5 episodes#Season 1: Signs and Portents}}
During 2258, [[Jeffrey Sinclair|Commander Jeffrey Sinclair]] is in charge of the station. Much of the story revolves around his gradual discovery that it was his capture by the Minbari at the Battle of the Line which ended the war against Earth. Upon capturing Sinclair, the Minbari came to believe that [[Valen]], a great Minbari leader and hero of the last Minbari-Shadow war, had been reincarnated as the Commander. Concluding that others of their species had been, and were continuing to be reborn as humans, and in obedience to the edict that Minbari do not kill one another, lest they harm the soul, they stopped the war just as [[Earth (Babylon 5)|Earth's]] final defenses were on the verge of collapse.

It is gradually revealed that [[Delenn|Ambassador Delenn]] is a member of the mysterious and powerful [[Grey Council]], the ruling body of the Minbari. Towards the end of 2258, she begins the transformation into a Minbari-human hybrid, ostensibly to build a bridge between the humans and Minbari. The year ends with the assassination of [[Earth Alliance (Babylon 5)|Earth Alliance]] President Luis Santiago, and rising tension between the Narn and Centauri, after a Narn outpost is completely destroyed by an unknown third party.

=== Season 2 <U+2013> year 2259 ===
{{Main|List of Babylon 5 episodes#Season 2: The Coming of Shadows}}
At the beginning of 2259, [[John Sheridan (Babylon 5)|Captain John Sheridan]] replaces Sinclair as the military governor of the station. He and the command staff learn that the death of President Santiago was actually an assassination masterminded by Vice President Clark (who assumed the Presidency upon Santiago's death). A conflict develops between the Babylon 5 command staff and the [[Psi Corps]], an increasingly [[autocratic]] organization which oversees and controls the lives of human [[telepathy|telepaths]]. Commander Ivanova, the second-in-command of the station, is secretly a latent telepath who has illicitly avoided registering with the Psi Corps.

The Shadows, an ancient and extremely powerful race who have recently emerged from hibernation, are revealed to be the cause of a variety of mysterious and disturbing events, including the attack on the Narn outpost at the end of 2258. Centauri Ambassador [[Londo Mollari]] unknowingly enlists their aid through his association with the mysterious [[Mr. Morden]] in the ongoing conflict with the Narn. The elderly and ailing Centauri emperor, long an advocate of reconciliation with the Narn, dies suddenly while visiting Babylon 5. A number of conspirators, including Londo Mollari and Refa, take control of Centauri government by assassinating their opponents and placing the late emperor's unstable nephew on the throne. Their first act is to start open aggression against the Narn. After full-scale war breaks out, the Centauri eventually conquer Narn in a brutal attack involving [[mass driver]]s, outlawed [[weapons of mass destruction]]. Towards the end of the year, the Clark administration begins to show increasingly totalitarian characteristics, clamping down on dissent and restricting [[freedom of speech]]. The [[Vorlon]]s are revealed to be the basis of legends about [[angel]]s on various worlds, including Earth, and are the ancient enemies of the Shadows. They enlist the aid of Sheridan and the Babylon 5 command staff in the struggle against the Shadows.

=== Season 3 <U+2013> year 2260 ===
{{Main|List of Babylon 5 episodes#Season 3: Point of No Return}}
The Psi Corps and President Clark, whose government has discovered Shadow vessels buried in Earth's solar system, begin to harness the vessels' advanced technology. The Clark administration continues to become increasingly [[xenophobia|xenophobic]] and totalitarian, and uses a military incident as an excuse to declare martial law. This triggers a war of independence on [[Mars]], which had long had a strained political relationship with Earth. Babylon 5 also declares independence from Earth, along with several other outlying Earth Alliance colonies. In response, the Earth Alliance attempts to retake Babylon 5 by force, but with the aid of the Minbari, who have allied with the station against the growing Shadow threat, the attack is repelled.

Becoming concerned over the Shadows' growing influence amongst his people, Centauri ambassador Londo Mollari attempts to sever ties with them. [[Morden (Babylon 5)|Mr. Morden]], the Shadows' human representative, tricks him into restoring the partnership by engineering the murder of Mollari's mistress. Open warfare breaks out between the Shadows and the alliance led by Babylon 5 and the Minbari. It is learned that genetic manipulation by the Vorlons is the source of human telepathy, as it is later discovered that Shadow ships are vulnerable to telepathic attacks. Displeased at the Vorlons' lack of direct action against the Shadows, Captain John Sheridan browbeats Vorlon ambassador [[Kosh Naranek]] into launching an attack against their mutual enemy. Kosh's deeds lead to his subsequent assassination by the Shadows.

Upon returning to the station, former commander Jeffrey Sinclair enlists the aid of Captain Sheridan, Delenn, Ivanova and Marcus and convinces them to help him steal the [[Babylon 4]] space station, intending to send it back in time 1,000 years to use it as a base of operations against the Shadows in the first Minbari-Shadow war. Undergoing the same transformation as Delenn at the end of Season 1, Sinclair transforms into a Minbari and is subsequently revealed to be the actual Valen of Minbari legend, rather than a reincarnation. Spurred by the reappearance of his assumed-dead wife (who now works for the Shadows), Sheridan travels to [[Z'ha'dum (planet)|Z'ha'dum]], the Shadow homeworld, in an attempt by them to recruit him. However he instead destroys their largest city in a ''kamikaze'' nuclear attack, and is last seen jumping into a miles-deep pit to escape the explosion.
Garibaldi, during a fight with Shadow vessels, goes missing.

=== Season 4 <U+2013> year 2261 ===
{{Main|List of Babylon 5 episodes#Season 4: No Surrender, No Retreat}}
In 2261, the Vorlons join the Shadow War, but their tactics become a concern for the alliance when the Vorlons begin destroying entire planets which they deem to have been "influenced" by the Shadows. Disturbed by this turn of events, Babylon 5 recruits several other powerful and ancient races (the [[First Ones]]) to their cause, against both the Shadows and the Vorlons. Captain John Sheridan returns to the station after escaping the destruction of Z'ha'dum, but at a price: barring illness or injury, he has only 20 years left to live. He is accompanied by a mysterious alien named Lorien who claims to be the oldest sentient being in the galaxy.

Hours before Sheridan's return, Garibaldi is rescued back to the station, in rather dubious circumstances. He is markedly more paranoid and suspicious of other alien races and of Sheridan than he was before.

Centauri Emperor [[Cartagia]] forges a relationship with the Shadows. Londo Mollari engineers the assassination of Cartagia and repudiates his agreement with the Shadows. Londo kills Mr. Morden and destroys the Shadow vessels based on the [[Centauri Prime|Centauri homeworld]], in an attempt to save his planet from destruction by the Vorlons. Aided by the other ancient races, and several younger ones, Sheridan lures both the Vorlons and the Shadows into an immense battle, during which the [[Vorlon]]s and Shadows reveal that they have been left as guardians of the younger races, but due to philosophical differences, ended up using them as pawns in their endless wars throughout the ages. The younger races reject their continued interference, and the Vorlons and Shadows, along with the remaining First Ones, agree to depart the galaxy forever.

After the Shadows are defeated Garibaldi leaves his post as security chief and works on his own as a "provider of information". Garibaldi was actually abducted by the Psi-Corps at the end of Season 3 and re-programmed by Bester to provide information to him at the right time.

[[Minbar (planet)|Minbar]] is gripped by a brief civil war between the Warrior and Religious castes. Delenn secretly meets with Neroon of the Warrior caste and convinces him that neither side can be allowed to win. She tells him that she will undergo a ritual wherein she will be willing to sacrifice herself, but will stop the ritual before she actually dies. When Neroon sees that she actually intends to go through the entire ritual, he rescues her and sacrifices himself instead, declaring that, although he was born Warrior, in his heart he is Religious.

As part of the ongoing conflict between Earth and Babylon 5, Garibaldi betrays Sheridan and arranges his capture. Garibaldi later reveals to Bester about a virus that is dangerous to only telepaths, which the Psi-Corps then destroys. Bester releases Garibaldi of his programming, and allows him to remember everything he has done since being kidnapped. Garibaldi helps free Sheridan and return him to the campaign to free Earth. An alliance led by Babylon 5 frees Earth from totalitarian rule by President Clark in a short but bloody war. This culminates in Clark's suicide and the restoration of democratic government. Mars is granted full independence, and Sheridan agrees to step down as commander of Babylon 5. The [[League of Non-Aligned Worlds]] is dissolved and reformed into the [[Interstellar Alliance (Babylon 5)|Interstellar Alliance]], with Sheridan elected as its first President and continuing his command of the [[Anla'shok|Rangers]], who are to act as a galactic equivalent of [[United Nations peacekeepers]].

In the season finale, the events of 100, 500, 1000, and one million years into the future are shown, depicting Babylon 5's lasting influence throughout history. Amongst the events shown are the political aftermath of the 2261 civil war, a subsequent nuclear war on Earth involving a new totalitarian government in the year AD 2762, the resulting fall of Earth into a [[pre-industrial society]], the loss and restoration of humanity's knowledge of space travel, and the final evolution of mankind into energy beings similar to the Vorlons, after which Earth's sun goes [[nova]].

=== Season 5 <U+2013> year 2262 ===
{{Main|List of Babylon 5 episodes#Season 5: The Wheel of Fire}}
In 2262, Earthforce Captain [[Elizabeth Lochley]] is appointed to command Babylon 5. The station grows in its role as a sanctuary for rogue telepaths running from the [[Psi Corps]], resulting in a violent conflict. [[G'Kar]], former Narn ambassador to Babylon 5, becomes a spiritual leader after a book was published that he wrote while incarcerated during the Narn-Centauri War. The [[Drakh]], former allies of the Shadows who remained in the galaxy, take control of [[Regent]] [[Virini]] on Centauri Prime through a parasitic creature called a Keeper, then incite a war between the Centauri and the Interstellar Alliance, in order to isolate the Centauri from the Alliance, and gain a malleable homeworld for themselves.

Centauri Prime is consequently decimated by [[Narn]] and [[Drazi]] warships, and Londo Mollari becomes emperor, accepting a Drakh Keeper under threat of the complete nuclear destruction of the planet. Portions of the end of his reign are seen in various prescient visions throughout the series; one such sequence shows Mollari and former nemesis (and later friend) G'Kar dying at each other's throats in an act of mutual suicide. [[Vir Cotto]], Mollari's loyal and more moral aide, succeeds him as emperor, free of Drakh influence. Sheridan and Delenn marry and move to Minbar, along with the headquarters of the Interstellar Alliance.

Twenty years later, on the verge of death, Sheridan takes one final trip to the now-obsolete Babylon 5 station before its decommissioning. Sheridan apparently dies, but is claimed by the First Ones, who invite him to join them on a journey beyond the rim of the galaxy. The Babylon 5 station is completely destroyed in a planned demolition shortly after Sheridan's departure, its existence no longer necessary as the Alliance has taken over its diplomatic purposes. This final episode features a cameo appearance by Straczynski as the technician who switches off the lights before Babylon 5 is evacuated and destroyed.

== Themes ==
Throughout its run, ''Babylon 5'' found ways to portray [[theme (literature)|theme]]s relevant to modern and historical social issues. It marked several firsts in television science fiction, such as the exploration of the political and social landscapes of the first human colonies, their interactions with Earth, and the underlying tensions.<ref name="mars"/> ''Babylon 5'' was also one of the first television science fiction shows to [[wikt:denotative|denotatively]] refer to a [[same-sex relationship]].<ref name="dyke1">{{cite web<!-- The article date was taken from the Internet Archive copy "Page info."

The clash between order and chaos, and the people caught in between, plays an important role in ''Babylon 5''. The conflict between two unimaginably powerful older races, the [[Vorlons]] and the [[Shadow (Babylon 5)|Shadows]], is represented as a battle between two competing ideologies, each seeking to turn the humans and the other younger races to their beliefs. The Vorlons represent an [[authoritarian]] philosophy: you will do what we tell you to, because we tell you to do it. The Vorlon question, "Who are you?" focuses on identity as a catalyst for shaping personal goals;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://jmsnews.com/msg.aspx?id=1-6531 |title=>>ZHD - Thoughts<< |date=1996-05-11 |accessdate=2006-09-02 |author= [[J.

The ''Babylon 5'' universe deals with numerous armed conflicts which range on an interstellar scale. The story begins in the aftermath of a war which brought the human race to the brink of extinction, caused by a misunderstanding during a [[first contact (science fiction)|first contact]] situation.<ref name="january"/> The Babylon 5 station is subsequently built in order to foster peace through diplomacy, described as the "last, best hope for peace" in the opening credits monologue during its first three seasons. Wars between separate alien civilizations are featured. The conflict between the [[Narn]] and the [[Centauri (Babylon 5)|Centauri]] is followed from its beginnings as a minor territorial dispute amplified by historical animosity, through to its end, in which [[weapons of mass destruction]] are employed to subjugate and enslave an entire planet. The war is an attempt to portray a more sobering kind of conflict than usually seen on science fiction television. Informed by the events of the first [[Gulf War]], the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] and the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Prague Spring#Intervention|invasion of Prague]], the intent was to recreate these moments when "the world held its breath" and the emotional core of the conflict was the disbelief that the situation could have occurred at all, and the desperation to find a way to bring it to an end.<ref>{{cite newsgroup |title=Coming of Shadows |author=[[J.

The [[Shadow War]] also features prominently in the show, during which an advanced alien species attempts to sow the seeds of conflict in order to promote technological and cultural advancement. The gradual discovery of the scheme and the rebellion against it, serve as the backdrop to the first three seasons,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jmsnews.com/msg.aspx?id=1-3813 |title=Voices |author=[[J.

The post-war landscape has its roots in the [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]].

=== Sacrifice ===
A major theme in ''Babylon 5'' is the concept of sacrifice for a greater cause. Kosh sacrifices his life for a first victory against the [[Shadow (Babylon 5)|Shadow]]s. [[John Sheridan (Babylon 5)|John Sheridan]] is ready to die at [[Z'ha'dum]]. [[Delenn]] is ready to die in the starfire wheel to restore [[Minbari]] society. [[Marcus Cole]] gives his life to save [[Susan Ivanova]]. [[Londo Mollari]] willingly accepts complete enslavement by a Drakh keeper to save the [[Centauri]] from annihilation. Many minor characters also willingly give their lives such as the crew of [[Drazi]] or [[Minbari]] ships in the final confrontation with the [[Shadow (Babylon 5)|Shadow]]s to save the Army of Light's leaders, some [[Centauri (Babylon 5)|Centauri]] staying back at the island of Selini to allow the destruction of the Shadow warships, and so on. "Some of us must be sacrificed if all are to be saved." is the spiritual epiphany experienced by [[G'Kar]]. This reflects the [[Vorlon]] philosophy in contrast to the self-interest philosophy of the [[Shadow (Babylon 5)|Shadow]]s.
But it also reflects the fact that ''Babylon 5'' is a big epic where believable "greater causes" can be established throughout the different storylines that also contain complex character development.

=== Dreams and visions ===
The subliminal and [[subconscious]] play a very significant role in the ''Babylon 5'' universe. Every single major character experiences, on at least one occasion, some altered state of consciousness in which he or she receives some sort of important mental message. This could either be one that further fleshes out the character for the benefit of the viewer, or one of transcendental and transpersonal nature that anticipates important further developments in the storyline. Some of these signs and portents resemble [[lucid dream]]s, but many are quite bizarre and "dreamlike," frequently in a spiritual context.

=== Addiction ===
Substance abuse and its impact on human personalities also plays a significant role in the ''Babylon 5'' storyline. The station's security chief, [[Michael Garibaldi]], is a textbook relapsing-remitting [[alcoholic]] of the [[binge drinking]] type; he practices complete [[abstinence]] from alcohol throughout most of the series (with [[Survivors (Babylon 5)|one notable exception]]) until the [[Phoenix Rising (Babylon 5)|middle of season five]]. He only recovers physically and socially and breaks the cycle at the end of the season. Dr. [[Stephen Franklin]] develops an (initially unrecognized) addiction to injectable [[stimulant]] drugs while trying to cope with the chronic stress and work overload in Medlab (stemming from the Markab extinction), and wanders off to the homeless and deprived in Brown Sector, where he suffers through a severe [[withdrawal]] syndrome. Executive Officer [[Susan Ivanova]] mentions that her father became an alcoholic after her mother had committed suicide after having been drugged by the authorities over a number of years. Captain [[Elizabeth Lochley]] tells Garibaldi that her father was an alcoholic and that she is a recovering alcoholic herself.<ref>Season 5, Episode 19: The Wheel of Fire</ref> Among the aliens, [[Londo Mollari]] is at least a heavy abuser of alcohol, mostly in the form of the Centauri national drink, Brivari (though in Centauri culture, sobriety, as opposed to drunkenness, is considered a vice).

Numerous other references to substance abuse and drug dealing are scattered throughout the storyline, including [[Psi Corps#Dust|Dust]], a white powder with a black-market presence comparable to cocaine. "Dust" turns out to be a "designer drug" developed by [[Psi Corps]] and placed into the black market as an experiment to see if psychic abilities could be brought out in "mundanes" (non-telepaths).

''The Gathering'' is the pilot, depicting the arrival of the major characters to the Babylon 5 station in 2257. ''In the Beginning'' depicts the events of the Earth-Minbari War, as revealed in the first few seasons, in chronological order and in greater detail than the main series. ''Thirdspace'' and ''The River of Souls'' are largely stand-alone episodes.

''A Call to Arms'' sets up the initial premise of the ''[[Crusade (TV series)|Crusade]]'' series, depicting the alien [[Drakh]] species releasing a [[grey goo|nanovirus plague]] on Earth, which will destroy all life on the planet within five years if it is not stopped. To that end, the [[Victory class destroyer|destroyer]] ''[[Excalibur (Crusade)|Excalibur]]'' is sent to look for a cure beyond Earth. ''To Live and Die in Starlight'', also known as ''Babylon 5: The Legend of the Rangers'', was intended as the pilot for the series of the same (''Legend of the Rangers'') name, but since the show was never picked up, it is now considered to be the sixth and last ''Babylon 5'' telefilm.

== Spin-offs ==
=== ''Crusade'' ===
{{Main|Crusade (TV series)}}
The spin-off series ''[[Crusade (TV series)|Crusade]]''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.midwinter.com/lurk/countries/us/guide/113.html |title=The Babylon Project: Crusade - Overview |publisher=midwinter.com |work=The Lurker's Guide To Babylon 5 |accessdate=2006-08-18}}</ref> ran on [[Turner Network Television|TNT]] for thirteen episodes, having been set up by the TV film ''A Call to Arms''. The production team received help from [[NASA]]'s [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] to make sure that the series depicted science and technology accurately.<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/releases/98/crusade2.html |publisher=NASA JPL |title=PRODUCERS OF 'BABYLON 5' TAP JPL'S BRAIN POWER FOR NEW SERIES |accessdate=2006-08-18}}</ref> However, creative differences between Straczynski and TNT caused problems; the network wanted more sex and violence,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aint-it-cool-news.com/display.cgi?id=2060 |title=Changes to Crusade |publisher=Ain't It Cool News |accessdate=2006-08-18}}</ref> and forced Straczynski to begin the first episode with a fistfight. The sex-and-violence request was later withdrawn, and TNT allocated more money to ''Crusade'', giving the actors better uniforms and new sets mid-season. However, due to the creative differences, TNT eventually decided to cancel the series after thirteen episodes had been produced, but before any of them were aired. At the time of the cancellation, only hints of major story arcs had yet come into play, though unproduced scripts published online by Straczynski<U+2014>in addition to comments made by him online, at conventions, and on the ''Crusade'' DVD commentaries<U+2014>reveal that they would have become prominent features of the series, had it continued.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

=== ''Legend of the Rangers'' ===
{{Main|Babylon 5: The Legend of the Rangers}}
A television film titled ''[[Babylon 5: The Legend of the Rangers|To Live and Die in Starlight]]'' was produced by the [[Syfy|Sci Fi Channel]]. It was the proposed pilot episode of a new series titled ''[[Babylon 5: The Legend of the Rangers]]''. Rescheduled after the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], the film aired on January 19, 2002. However, it was scheduled against an [[NFL]] [[American Football Conference|AFC]] Divisional Championship playoff game. The pilot's poor ratings contributed to the lessening of the network's interest in a series pick-up, as did the poor reception it received from fans and critics alike, particularly for its depiction of a virtual-reality weapon, but the final nail in its coffin was the dispute between Warner Bros. and [[Vivendi Universal]] (owners of the Sci Fi Channel) over revenue-sharing for the potential weekly series.

=== ''The Lost Tales'' ===
{{Main|Babylon 5: The Lost Tales}}
A new project set in ''Babylon 5'' universe was announced by Straczynski at [[San Diego Comic Con]] 2006.<ref name="jmsnewsnews">{{cite web |last=Schroeder |first=Jan |title=JMSNews news page |work = JMSNews, The J. Michael Straczynski Message Archive |date=2006-08-08 |url=http://jmsnews.com/news.aspx |accessdate=2006-08-27}}</ref> ''Babylon 5: The Lost Tales'' is a set of mini-stories featuring established characters from the series, released direct-to-DVD. Production of the first anthology of two stories, named collectively ''[[Babylon 5: The Lost Tales#Voices in the Dark|Voices in the Dark]]'', commenced in November 2006 with Straczynski writing, producing, and directing. It was released July 31, 2007. In a [[Usenet]] post on September 5, 2007, Straczynski stated that Warner Bros. "are most pleased as sales have been several orders of magnitude beyond what they anticipated."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://worldsofjms.com/usenet/post/070905a.htm |title=Re: JMS: A Rant |accessdate=2007-10-25 |last=Straczynski |first=J.

On July 13, 2008, Straczynski revealed that he had no plans to continue ''The Lost Tales''. He said that although the studio was interested in another disc, they wanted to budget the next installment similarly to the first. Citing his disappointment with the first release due to the low budget, Straczynski said he did not want to dilute ''Babylon 5'''s legacy with further sub-par stories. He stated that he would only return to the ''Babylon 5'' universe if Warner Bros. wanted to do a large-budgeted cinema release.<ref name="update">{{cite newsgroup |title=from jms: update |author=[[J.

=== ''The Memory of Shadows'' (unproduced) ===
{{Main|The Memory of Shadows}}
In 2004 and early 2005, rumors widely circulated about a planned ''Babylon 5'' film for theatrical release. However, on February 25, 2005, a post from Straczynski announced that the project had fallen through, and was for all practical purposes dead.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jmsnews.com/msg.aspx?id=1-17289 |title=From jms re: tmos |accessdate=2006-08-18 |author=jms}}</ref> The proposed film, titled ''[[The Memory of Shadows]]'' (TMoS), was written by Straczynski. Filming was to have begun in April 2005 in the UK, with Steven Beck as the director.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.monstersandcritics.com/movies/news/article_2833.php/Steven_Beck_to_Direct_Babylon_5_Movie_The_Memory_of_Shadows|title=Steven Beck to Direct Babylon 5 Movie The Memory of Shadows|date=12-08-2004|accessdate=2009-07-28|author=James Wray}}</ref>

During the "Spotlight on J. Michael Straczynski" panel at the 2010 [[New York Comic Con]], Straczynski revealed <U+201C>I said to Warner Bros. a while back, 'When you<U+2019>re ready to do something real with 'Babylon 5,' either a big-budget film or a TV show, if you want to do one of those two things, call me, otherwise don<U+2019>t bother me.' About a month ago the phone rang. I don<U+2019>t know where this is gonna go yet, but when they call you, there<U+2019>s something going on. I can<U+2019>t tell you what it is yet and it may not go anywhere, but there is movement in the tall grass.<U+201D><ref name="comicbookresources1">{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=28907|title=NYCC: Spotlight on J. Michael Straczynski|date=2010-10-15|accessdate=2010-10-17|author=Karl Keily - Comic Book Resources}}</ref>

=== Novels, short stories and comic books ===
{{Main|Babylon 5 novels, short stories and comic books}}
Unique to the ''Babylon 5'' universe among virtually all other shared media universes is the sanctioned canonicity of many of its offshoot novels and comic book stories; nearly all of the ''Babylon 5'' novels and novelizations to date having been based on outlines written directly by J. Michael Straczynski. The later Del Rey books are considered to be more [[canon (fiction)|canonical]] than some of the earlier Del ones, and at least two major plotline revelations were made in the [[DC Comics]] series that were directly referenced in the TV series. In all, per Straczynski's own remarks, canonical elements exist in every single book or comic published to date, and his deeper involvement in the novel-publishing program from 1996 onward has ensured a greater level of canonicity within such works.

Additionally, Straczynski himself penned a number of short stories, published in ''[[Amazing Stories]]'' magazine, expanding on several key story-points from the television series, along with a number of other established authors, with all such tales considered as "real" as the TV show itself.

As of 2007, Straczynski was still writing the manuscript for a ''Babylon 5'' graphic novel, which was to be published by [[Wildstorm Productions]]. The premise, characters, and plot have not been officially confirmed, but it has been reported that Straczynski originally planned to write a story that takes place before the season three two-parter "[[War Without End (Babylon 5)|War Without End]]", featuring Sinclair and Sheridan, and involving Mars, Minbar, Babylon 5, and a conspiracy. It has also been reported that he subsequently decided to tie in elements from the spin-offs ''Crusade'' and ''Legend of the Rangers'' into the book.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://worldsofjms.com/projects.htm#b5book |title=Straczynski Project Watch |accessdate=2007-08-11}}</ref> The graphic novel was to be 100 pages long.

When asked by a fan during the "Spotlight on J. Michael Straczynski" panel at the 2010 New York Comic Con, Straczynski said no new ''Babylon 5'' comics were in the works.<ref name="comicbookresources1"/>

== DVD releases ==
=== Season releases ===
[[File:Babylon 5 Season 1.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The first season DVD set]]
All five seasons have been released individually as a set of six DVDs in the US and the UK. A complete five season set of 30 DVDs is also available in each of the two DVD regions, titled ''Babylon 5: The Complete Television Series'' for the US and Canada, and ''Babylon 5: The Complete Universe'' for the UK. The UK version also includes all the films and the short-lived spin-off ''[[Crusade (TV series)|Crusade]]''. As of 2007, all 5 television seasons and their individual episodes are also for sale at the [[iTunes Store]]. The first five seasons have been recently re-released on DVD with publishing dates of June 2009.

According to producer J. Michael Straczynski as of mid-2006, "The DVD sales have raised over 500 million in revenue." The financial success of the DVD box sets has led to a renewed interest in further ''Babylon 5'' work.<ref>{{cite web|author=Ain't It Cool News|date=2006-07-24|url=http://www.aintitcool.com/display.cgi?id=23963|title=Babylon 5 Returns!|accessdate=2009-10-16}}</ref>

=== ''Babylon 5'' TV film releases ===
[[File:Babylon 5 The Movie Box Set.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The Movie Collection DVD set]]
The ''Babylon 5'' TV films were distributed differently in the US and UK. Initially a DVD containing the two films ''The Gathering'' and ''In the Beginning'' were released on both region 1 (North America) and region 2 (UK) DVD. Then, in the US, the first five films, which aired while ''Babylon 5'' was still on the air, were released in one boxset, with the TV film ''Legend of the Rangers'' getting its own separate release on both region 1 and region 2 DVD. In the UK, a film boxset was released, but instead of containing the five films like the US version, it contained only the three films which had not been released in the UK yet (''Thirdspace'', ''River of Souls'', and ''A Call to Arms''). ''The Gathering'' was released as a low-priced promotional R1 DVD in 2004, intended as a trial of the series proper; Warner Bros. issued several such DVDs but discontinued the line shortly thereafter due to lack of interest.

=== Mastering problems ===
The transfer of ''Babylon 5'' from fullscreen to widescreen (originally for the Sci Fi Channel; later released on DVD) created significant problems with regard to [[special effect|special-effects]]/[[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] footage. Several factors complicated the process.<ref name="Herranen1">{{cite web |url=http://www.modeemi.fi/~leopold/Babylon5/DVD/DVDTransfer.html |title=How Babylon 5 is Transferred to DVD |accessdate=2009-10-15 |author=Henrik Herranen}}</ref>

* Although originally broadcast in the standard television [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]] of [[Aspect ratio (image)|4:3]], all live-action footage was filmed on [[Super 35 mm film]] (with a ratio of [[Aspect ratio (image)|1.65:1]]). The idea was that, once [[widescreen]] televisions (with an aspect ratio of [[Aspect ratio (image)|16:9]] or [[Aspect ratio (image)|1.78:1]]) became more popular, the episodes could be easily converted into a widescreen format.
* CGI shots were rendered in the 4:3 ratio, but designed so that the top and bottom of each shot could be removed to create a widescreen image without ruining the image composition. For the widescreen DVD releases technical problems occurred during the [[progressive scan]] transfer and re-formatting, introducing artifacts that resulted in a picture quality of the CGI shots now inferior to the few [[laserdisc]] and other 4:3 home video releases.
* While the camera negatives of the original live-action shots held the potential for [[High-definition television|high-definition]] digital images, the CGI shots and shots combining live-action with CGI, were stored in the much lower-definition [[NTSC]] digital format. (Again, the expectation was that it would be relatively cheap in the future to recreate the CGI in widescreen.)
* Over the years, the original computer-generated models, etc., have been lost, making it necessary to use the old 4:3 CGI shots. Both [[Foundation Imaging]] and its successor, [[Netter Digital]], have gone out of business.

This has resulted in several consistent flaws throughout the ''Babylon 5'' widescreen release. In particular, quality drops significantly whenever a scene cuts from purely live-action to a shot combining live-action and CGI. This is particularly noticeable on the [[PAL]] DVDs, since CGI shots had to be converted from NTSC, as well as being blown up to fit a widescreen television. In addition, while the live-action film was originally widescreen, shots were composed for 4:3, resulting in a conspicuous tendency for actors to clump up in the middle of the screen.<ref name="Herranen1"/>

For these reasons, [[Warner Home Video]] is unlikely to release the series on [[Blu-Ray]]. Additionally, a [[Blu-Ray]] version of the first ''Lost Tales'' installment, ''Voices in the Dark'', was cancelled due to poor sales.

== Soundtrack releases ==
A total of 30 soundtrack albums have been released for ''Babylon 5''. They are all composed by the series composer Christopher Franke and released under his own record label Sonic Images.<ref>{{cite web<!-- The page is dynamically generated so the page's 'date' parameter ends up being the same as the access date. Checked page metadata. --> |first=Christopher |last=Franke |authorlink=Christopher Franke |title=Babylon 5 - Original Soundtracks |url=http://www.sonicimages.com/action.lasso?-database=Products.fp5&-layout=CGI&-response=/2001/Sub/SIR/b5/index.html&-nothing |work=Sonic Images |publisher=Sonic Images Records |location=Studio City, CA 91604 |year = 2009 |accessdate=2009-10-15 |quote=main title narration by [[Claudia Christian]]}}</ref> These albums include 24 episode soundtracks, three film soundtracks, and three compilation albums: ''Babylon 5: Vol 1'', ''Babylon 5: Vol 2'', and ''Best of Babylon 5''.

=== Compilation soundtracks ===
These include music that appeared throughout the series, but have been extensively reorchestrated, rewritten, and remixed by Franke into lengthy movements. The second full-length CD also features the main titles from seasons 1 to 4 (the main title for season 5 can be heard on the CD ''Best of Babylon 5'', released in 2001).

=== Episodic and feature film soundtracks ===
The 27 episodic and feature film soundtracks include the exact unedited music from each corresponding episode or feature film, with no alterations, omissions, or additions.

== Other releases ==
Seasons 1<U+2013>2 and parts of season 3 of ''Babylon 5'' have been released as advertisement-supported downloads through the [[In2TV]] and [[Hulu]] download services. Additionally, every episode from seasons 1 to 5, as well as the pilot film ''[[Babylon 5: The Gathering]]'', are available for purchase on the Xbox Live Marketplace in the United States. All 5 seasons, and 5 movies (''In The Beginning'',Thirdspace, ''River of Souls'', ''A Call To Arms'', ''Legend of the Rangers'') are available through [[iTunes]]. All 92 television episode scripts (plus two TV film scripts) written by J. Michael Straczynski for the series are being published as a series of 15 volumes.<ref>{{cite web |title=Babylon 5 Scripts |url=http://www.babylon5scripts.com/ |accessdate=2006-11-10}}</ref>{{Clarify|date=November 2008|reason=Needs update; statement written two almost years ago.}} Contrary to original predictions the [[laserdisc]] home video releases had the 4:3 format, and only season 1 and 5 became completely available with seasons 2 and 4 only being released fragmentary.

== Games ==
In November 1997, Chameleon Eclectic Entertainment published the original ''The Babylon Project: The Roleplaying Game Based on Babylon 5''.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Babylon Project: The Roleplaying Game Based on Babylon 5 |author=Cochran, Joseph |publisher=Chameleon Eclectic Entertainment, Inc. |month=November |year=1997}}</ref> In 2003, [[Mongoose Publishing]] printed the ''Babylon 5 Roleplaying Game & Factbook''.<ref>{{cite book |title=Babylon 5 Roleplaying Game & Factbook |author=Hahn, August |coauthors=Matthew Sprange|publisher=[[Mongoose Publishing]] |year=2003}}</ref>

The Babylon 5 Component Game system was also released in 1997 by 'Component Game Systems'. It was a complex political and military based game, using a number of individually purchased expansions or components, which could take up to 5 hours to play. Component Game Systems came out with a number of component game systems that used the same semi-collectible approach, and was derived from the unpublished Galactic Empires board game, based on the CCG of the same name<U+2014>Companion Games (Galactic Empires' publisher) became Component Game Systems in the process. The basic idea is that each player need only buy his part of the game, representing in this case a specific political entity from the Babylon 5 universe. Players sit down at the same table and combine their components to have a game. 'Component Game Systems' folded in 1999 after having released only the first two 'years' (2258 and 2259) worth of Babylon related components for the game, and even their domain name (www.c-g-s.com) has been recycled by some unrelated group.

The ''[[Babylon 5 Wars]]'' [[wargaming|wargame]] was first published by [[Agents of Gaming]] in 1998. The game was developed in close contact with the creators of the show, and most of the published material is considered canon.<ref>Graw, B. and Glass, R.: "Babylon 5 Wars Second Edition Rules Compendium.", page 1. Agents of Gaming, 2000</ref> Agents of Gaming later published ''[[Babylon 5 Fleet Action]]'', which focused on battles of a larger scale. In 2004, ''[[Babylon 5: A Call to Arms (game)|Babylon 5: A Call to Arms]]'' was released by Mongoose Publishing. The game is similar in many ways to ''Babylon 5 Wars'' but has a more streamlined rules set and games take a lot less time to complete.

[[Precedence Entertainment]] produced the [[Babylon 5 Collectible Card Game]] between 1997 and 2000. In its original form, the [[collectible card game|game]] allowed for 2-4 players with each one playing one of the ambassadors to the B5 council: Sinclair, Delenn, G'Kar or Londo. Later expansions increased the maximum number of players that could play at once and expanded the players' options. Players could represent the [[League of Non-Aligned Worlds]] or could play alternative ambassadors such as Bester for the [[Psi Corps]] or Lord Refa for the Centauri. The game was discontinued after Precedence lost the license from [[Warner Brothers]] in 2000.

There are no officially licensed ''Babylon 5'' video games on the market, though in 1998 a video game based on ''Babylon 5'', named ''Into the Fire'', was being developed by Yosemite Entertainment, an internal division of [[Sierra Entertainment]]. Work on this game ended on September 21, 1999, when, as part of a corporate reorganization, Sierra cancelled it and laid off its development staff when the game was only a few months away from release.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.space.com/sciencefiction/babylon5_990922.html |title=More Disappointment for Babylon 5 |accessdate=2006-09-02|author=}}</ref> This game was to have cast the player as the pilot of a Starfury fighter craft, giving the player an opportunity to "move up through the ranks," and eventually take command of capital ships and even fleets. Christopher Franke composed and recorded new music for the game, and [[live action]] footage was filmed with the primary actors from the series.

A number of unauthorized ''Babylon 5 '' [[mod (computer gaming)|modifications]] have been created for other computer games such as Homeworld and Homeworld 2, as well as at least one (unlicensed) independent project to develop a standalone game. The only finished work as yet though is the free and standalone game "The Babylon Project" based on the [[FreeSpace 2 Source Code Project]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gameshark.com/pc/features/549/Monthly-Mod-Focus-The-Babylon-Project.htm |title=The Babylon Project |accessdate=2008-12-15|author=}}</ref>
