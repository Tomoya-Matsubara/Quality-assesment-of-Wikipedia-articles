The '''list of New York hurricanes''' encompasses 83&nbsp;tropical or subtropical [[cyclone]]s that have affected the state of [[New York]] since the 17th century. The state of New York is located along the [[U.S. East Coast|East coast of the United States]], in the [[Northeast United States|Northeastern]] portion of the country. The strongest of these storms was the [[1938 New England Hurricane]], which struck [[Long Island]] as a Category&nbsp;3 storm on the [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale]]. Killing more than 60&nbsp;people, it was also the deadliest. Tropical cyclones have affected the state primarily in September but have also hit during every month of the hurricane season, June through November. Tropical cyclones rarely make landfall on the state, although it is common for remnants of tropical cyclones to produce heavy rainfall and flooding.
