'''Robert Nisbet''' was a [[Shetland]] [[sea captain]]. He was born on 15 October 1834 at [[Burravoe]] on the island of [[Yell, Shetland]]. He died on 3 May 1917 at [[Leith]], [[Scotland]].

His parents were Henry Nisbet and Tamar Williamson. Henry was born in 1807 on the northernmost Shetland island of [[Unst]]. Tamar was born in 1808 at Houlland<ref>http://www.scotlandsplaces.gov.uk/search_item/index.php?service=RCAHMS&id=189208 Accessed 14 April 2013</ref> on the island of [[Yell, Shetland]].

Nisbet<U+2019>s career commenced at about the age of 17 in 1851. After sailing a year on the ''Active'' (63 gross tons) <ref>http://www.shetlopedia.com/Active Accessed 6 April 2013</ref> in the Shetland islands [[packet trade]], he travelled south in 1852 and joined the [[collier (ship)]] ''Friendship'' of [[Kingston upon Hull]] (Hull) under Captain Weldon. The ''Friendship'' was engaged in [[Firth of Forth]] and [[London]] trade. For eighteen months Nisbet was employed aboard the ''Friendship'', until she was wrecked without loss of life off [[Bridlington]], [[Yorkshire]].

In the first two or three years of Nisbet<U+2019>s career, all the coasting trade was done by [[sailing ships]]. When he was in the colliers between [[Leith]] and [[London]], there was only one [[steamboat]] <U+2014> the ''Prompt'' <U+2014> which plied between these two ports.

After the ''Friendship'' was wrecked, Nisbet joined another vessel in the same trade, the ''Duchess of Portland'' of [[Leith]], which was commanded by two brothers well known in Leith <U+2013> James and William Barnetson. On that vessel<U+2019>s second trip she almost came to grief. When leaving [[Leith]], with a northerly gale blowing, she collided with Victoria Docks and damaged her bows. She continued on the passage, but it was with considerable difficulty that the [[crew]] managed to keep her from sinking on the trip. On reaching [[London]] she was put into [[drydock]], and Nisbet took the chance of leaving the ship, with a view to working on foreign-going vessels.

On leaving the ''Duchess of Portland'', in 1854 Nisbet shipped for about a year on board the [[barque]] ''Mary Eleanor'' of London under Captain Jones bound from [[London]] to [[Constantinople]] and the [[Black Sea]]. Nisbet sailed on the ''Mary Eleanor'' for nine months as [[boatswain]] and four months as [[second mate]].

The [[Crimean War]] (October 1853 <U+2013> February 1856) was then in progress. The ''Mary Eleanor'' was commissioned to take stores for the hospital at [[Scutari Barracks]], opposite [[Constantinople]]. When the ship got to the [[Black Sea]], all the crew except five left to join the [[Royal Navy]]. Nisbet remained with the ship and was promoted to [[second mate]]. At that time he was reputedly the youngest [[second mate]] in [[United Kingdom|Britain]].

At Scutari (modern-day [[<U+00DC>sk<U+00FC>dar]] in [[Turkey]])<ref>Florence Nightingale arrived in early November 1854 at the Scutari Hospital. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence_Nightingale Accessed 17 March 2013.</ref> the crew had to build stores, and then unload the cargo from the ship. After the [[Battle of Balaclava]] ended on 25 October 1854 Nisbet assisted in burying three hundred dead Russian soldiers in a mass grave.

After the ''Mary Eleanor'', Nisbet joined the ''Egyptian'' of [[Glasgow]] under Captain Robert Tait. He went on two trading voyages to the Mediterranean, calling in at [[Malta]], [[Syria]], [[Salonica]], [[Constantinople]], [[Smyrna]], [[Alexandria]], [[Malta]], [[Gibraltar]] and back to [[Liverpool]].

Nisbet also served for some time in the ''Elsie'' of [[Glasgow]] under Captain Donald Main. The ''Elsie'' was of 1300 tons, and was considered a big ship at that time.

In late 1855, Nisbet joined the wood [[barque]] ''Jacatra'', of [[Glasgow]]<ref>http://www.clydesite.co.uk/clydebuilt/viewship.asp?id=3804</ref>  under Captain James McToldridge on a trading voyage to the [[Far East]]. He signed [[articles of agreement]] in her for a period not to exceed three years. The ship discharged a portion of her [[cargo]] at Batavia (now [[Jakarta]] in [[Indonesia]]), another portion at [[Singapore]], and the balance of the [[cargo]] and some coals at [[Manila]]. There a cargo of [[sugar]] and [[Manila hemp]] was loaded for [[San Francisco]].

When three days out of [[Manila]] the ''Jacatra'' was severely battered by a [[typhoon]], and her [[bulwarks]] were damaged. On arrival at [[San Francisco]] the ship was repaired and loaded for a voyage to [[Australia]]. But carpenters' wages were then very high - $7.00 a day - and so apparently very little was done to the vessel to make her seaworthy.

The ''Jacatra'' belonged to Duncan McGregor & Co. of [[Glasgow]], and the owner's son Malcolm McGregor was out on his second voyage in her with a view to being trained to become a [[sea captain]]. Nisbet spoke to him about the unseaworthy way the ship was repaired. McGregor agreed, and went ashore. The next day Nisbet and six of the crew left three days before the ''Jacatra'' was posted to sail, and the rest of the crew followed. The captain, [[mate (naval officer)|mate]], [[second mate]], cook, and [[carpenter]] were left on board. Nevertheless the ''Jacatra'' arrived in [[Sydney]] on 15 November 1855 without Malcolm McGregor on board.<ref>http://mariners.records.nsw.gov.au/1857/11/024jac.htm Accessed 14 April 2013</ref> <ref>On 21 April 1868 the New Zealand newspaper the ''Otago Daily Times'' p.1 published a notice seeking information as to the whereabouts of Malcolm McGregor stating that he arrived in Melbourne in 1858 or 1859 per the ship ''Jacatra'' under Captain James McToldridge. http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&d=ODT18680421.2.2.6&dliv=&e=-------10--1----0-- Accessed 16 March 2013</ref>

At [[San Francisco]] Nisbet joined a [[steamboat]] for the first time <U+2013> the large [[paddle steamer]] ''Columbia'', of [[New York]]. He sailed in the ''Columbia'' for about six months between [[San Francisco]] and [[Portland, Oregon]] on wages of $40.00 a month.

In about November 1857, Nisbet decided to return home but he could not get a British ship at [[San Francisco]]. He joined the Swedish ship ''Atlantic'' of [[Lule<U+00E5>]] under Captain C. A. Carlstein, and was in her for almost a year. The [[crew]] that shipped at [[San Francisco]] left the vessel in [[Callao]], [[Peru]]. A second crew was secured, and, after doing another trip, the ''Atlantic'' returned to [[Callao]] to sail from there to [[Europe]]. There the crew again left, and only one Swede and young Nisbet remained. A third crew was shipped and as Nisbet could understand orders and could also make them understood, he was chosen as [[interpreter]]. The ''Atlantic'' was bound for [[Cowes]], [[Isle of Wight]], and reached there after a five months passage.

During the passage Nisbet acted as [[sailmaker]], and at this time made his first start with [[navigation]], under the instruction of Captain Carlstein, who lent him books on the subject.

At [[Cowes]] the ship was ordered to go to [[Hamburg]], and at [[Gl<U+00FC>ckstadt]], Germany the crew were paid off. Nisbet then returned to [[England]], and decided to go to his home in the [[Shetland Islands]], where he would take a three months holiday and study [[navigation]]. When he was about to leave for the south to pass the Board examinations, he was asked to go to [[Southampton]] with an old shipmaster, to bring home a vessel to the [[Shetland Islands]].

The vessel, which was the [[schooner]] ''Novice'', was bought for Captain Arthur Pottinger of [[Scalloway]] on the island of [[Mainland, Shetland]].  However, Captain Pottinger was unfit to sail in the ''Novice'' on account of advancing years. In April 1859 Nisbet was appointed master of the ''Novice'', and on 9th May of that year first sailed as master of that craft. The ''Novice'' was engaged in the [[Faroe Islands]], Davis Straits, and [[Shetland Islands]] trade.

With this object in view, a larger vessel, the ''Imogen'', was purchased, and a request was forwarded to Nisbet to take command of the new vessel. It was a new venture, and the promoters thought that, with one in command possessed of the energy and ability of Nisbet, it would prove a success; and it did. The ''Imogen'' traded to [[Uyeasound]], [[Baltasound]] and [[Haroldswick]] on the Shetland island of [[Unst]].<ref>Manson, Thomas ''Lerwick During the Last Half Century (1867-1917)'' Lerwick Community Council, 1991.</ref>

Nisbet sailed as master for several seasons to the [[Faroe Islands]] fishing, gaining new experiences in that hazardous business.

Nisbet had been in the ''Imogen'' for only five months, when he was asked in August 1865 to take over command of the [[clipper]] ''Matchless'' from Captain James Aitken.<ref>Manson, Thomas ''Lerwick During the Last Half Century (1867-1917'') Lerwick Community Council, 1991.</ref>  The ''Matchless'' was engaged in the [[packet trade]] between [[Leith]] and [[Lerwick]], [[Mainland, Shetland]]. For the next ten years, until 1875, Nisbet traded in the ''Matchless'' between [[Leith]] and [[Shetland]]. The ''Matchless'' was a well known trader in [[Leith]], and at that time was recognised as one of the finest and fastest [[clippers]] sailing out of the port. On one occasion Nisbet went with the ''Matchless'' from [[Lerwick]] to [[Leith]] in 27 hours. Nisbet is reported as saying: <U+201C>She was a bonnie ship, the ''Matchless'' and I think that was the best ten years of my life <U+2013> the time I was in her.<U+201D>

During the time that Nisbet was in command of the ''Matchless'', he acted as commission agent for the sale of north country products, and did business with such [[Leith]] firms as Messrs Aitken & Wright, J. & J. Stewart, J.S. Linklater and J. & J. Tod.

The increased trade of [[Scalloway]] on the west side of [[Mainland, Shetland]] in the mid-nineteenth century led to cargo vessels running in from [[Leith]].  Most famous was the [[clipper]] ''Queen of the Isles'' of 82 tons, built at [[Leith]] in 1845 for a Shetland syndicate.  In 1875 Nisbet acquired an interest in the ''Queen of the Isles'', trading between [[Leith]] and the west side of Shetland. Nisbet who skippered the ''Queen of the Isles'' for many years, proved a key figure in the island service with his long experience of the dangerous passage up the west side of Shetland.

Five years later in 1880 saw the inauguration of the first [[steamboat]] between Leith and the west side of Shetland. Nisbet provided such a good service for passengers and traders that, when the North of Scotland, Orkney and Shetland Steam Navigation Company provided a Shetland west-side run from [[Leith]] and [[Aberdeen]] via [[Stromness]], [[Orkney]] in 1881, he was invited to take command of the 254 ton steamship ''SS Queen''.<ref>See details of the ship and crew at ''Maritime History Archive'' http://www.mun.ca/mha/1881/viewcrew1881a.php?Record_ID=68474&%20CrewListPage=2 Accessed 6 April 2013</ref> The ''SS Queen'' had been acquired by the North of Scotland, Orkney and Shetland Steam Navigation Company in 1861.  It was the first screw-driven ship used regularly on the Shetland run.<ref>Nicolson, James R., ''Shetland'' David and Charles, 1971, p.187.</ref>

In 1881 a third weekly run began from [[Leith]] on Mondays to [[Aberdeen]], [[Stromness]] and [[Scalloway]], the west-side service going on from [[Scalloway]] to other ports on the west side of Shetland, a service that continued with variations until 1939.

When master of the first west-side steamer, Nisbet organised all kinds of private arrangements before the erection of official lighthouses.  A lamp in a [[crofter]]<U+2019>s cottage guided him through Vaila Sound into [[Walls, Shetland]] and a lamp in the staircase window of Melby House helped him negotiate Papa Sound, a service he acknowledged with a blast on the ship<U+2019>s whistle as he passed.<ref>Elizabeth Balneaves, ''The Windswept Isles'' John Gifford, London, 1977, p. 240.</ref>

Nisbet was employed by the North of Scotland, Orkney and Shetland Steam Navigation Company for over 30 years and was in charge of various of their vessels, including the ''St Ninian'' and the ''St. Nicholas''.

He was a member and elder of St. Ninian<U+2019>s [[United Free Church of Scotland]] at [[Leith]].

On 23 February 1860 Nisbet married Catherine Barbara Taylor who was a niece on her mother<U+2019>s side of John Clunies-Ross, [[King of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands]]. They had 10 children of whom two died in infancy. The family was based in [[Lerwick]] but moved to [[Leith]] sometime before 1881.

Nisbet, died at his residence, 4 Dudley Terrace, [[Leith]], on 3 May 1917 at the age of 82 having retired from his command some years earlier. His wife predeceased him and he was buried next to her in [[Rosebank Cemetery]], [[Edinburgh]].<ref>''Shetland News'' 17 May 1917</ref>
