The '''cutthroat trout''' (''Oncorhynchus clarki'') is a species of [[salmonid]] native to cold-water [[tributary|tributaries]] of the Pacific Ocean, [[Rocky Mountains]] and [[Great Basin]] in North America. As a member of the genus ''[[Oncorhynchus]]'', it is one of the Pacific [[trout]], a group that includes the widely distributed [[rainbow trout]].  Cutthroat trout are popular [[gamefish]], especially among [[Angling|angler]]s who enjoy [[fly fishing]].  The common name "cutthroat" refers to the distinctive red coloration on the underside of the [[Mandible|lower jaw]]. The [[specific name (zoology)|specific name]] ''clarki'' was given to honor explorer [[William Clark (explorer)|William Clark]], coleader of the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]].

Cutthroat trout usually inhabit and [[Spawn (biology)|spawn]] in small to moderately large, clear, well-oxygenated, shallow rivers with gravel bottoms and clear, cold, moderately deep lakes. They are native to the [[Alluvium|alluvial]] or freestone streams that are typical tributaries of the Pacific basin, Great Basin and Rocky Mountains. They are spring spawners and naturally [[hybrid (biology)|hybridize]] with rainbow trout to produce fertile [[cutbow]]s. Some [[population]]s of the coastal cutthroat trout (''O. c. clarki'') are semi[[anadromous]].

Several [[subspecies]] of cutthroat are currently listed as [[threatened species|threatened]] in their native ranges due to [[habitat loss]] and [[introduced species|introduction]] of non-native species.  Two subspecies, ''O. c. alvordensis'' and ''O. c. macdonaldi'', are considered [[extinct]].  Cutthroat trout are raised in [[fish hatchery|hatcheries]] to restore native populations, as well as stock non-native lake environments to support angling.

The cutthroat trout type species and several subspecies are the [[List of U.S. state fish|state fish]] in seven western U.S. states.

==Taxonomy==
The scientific name of the cutthroat trout is ''Oncorhynchus clarki''.  They were the first trout encountered by Europeans when in 1541 Spanish explorer [[Francisco de Coronado]] recorded seeing trout, most likely Rio Grande cutthroat trout (''O. c. virginalis'') in the [[Pecos River]] near [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]].<ref name=BehnkeOclarki/> The species was first described in the journals of explorer William Clark from specimens obtained during the Lewis and Clark Expedition from the [[Missouri River]] near [[Great Falls, Montana]].  These were most likely the westslope cutthroat trout (''O. c. lewisi''). Cutthroat trout were given the name ''Salmo clarki'' in honor of William Clark, who co-led the expedition of 1804<U+2013>1806.<ref name=richardson/> One of Lewis and Clark's missions was to describe the flora and fauna encountered during the expedition.  The [[type specimen]] of ''S. clarki'' was described by naturalist [[John Richardson (naturalist)|John Richardson]] from a tributary of the lower [[Columbia River]], identified as the "Katpootl",<ref name=richardson/> which was perhaps the [[Lewis River (Washington)|Lewis River]] as there was a [[Multnomah (tribe)|Multnomah]] village of similar name at the [[confluence]].  This type specimen was most likely the coastal cutthroat subspecies.<ref name=BehnkeOclarki/>

In 1989, [[Morphology (biology)|morphological]] and [[Genetics|genetic]] studies indicated trout of the [[Pacific ocean|Pacific basin]] were genetically closer to Pacific salmon (''Oncorhynchus'' species) than to the ''[[Salmo]]s''&ndash;[[brown trout]] (''S. trutta'') or [[Atlantic salmon]] (''S. salar'') of the [[Atlantic ocean|Atlantic basin]].<ref>{{cite journal |url= |title=The Classification and Scientific Names of Rainbow and Cutthroat Trouts |journal=Fisheries |authors=Gerald R.

==Description==
[[File:Yellowstone cutthroat trout slash.jpg|thumb|alt=Photo of cutthroat trout head with red throat slashes|Head and throat of Yellowstone cutthroat trout ''O. c. bouvieri'']]
Throughout their native and introduced ranges, cutthroat trout vary widely in size, coloration and habitat selection.  Though their coloration can range from golden to gray to green on the back, and depending on subspecies, [[Strain (biology)|strain]] and habitat, they usually feature distinctive red, pink, or orange linear marks along the undersides of their [[mandible]]s in the lower folds of the [[gill]] plates. These markings are responsible for the common name "cutthroat" given to the trout by outdoor writer [[Charles Hallock]] in an 1884 article in ''The American Angler''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Trotter |first=Patrick C. |title=Cutthroat: Native Trout of the West |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley, CA |year=2008 |edition=2nd |isbn=978-0-520-25458-9 |page=13}}</ref>  Some coastal rainbow trout (''Oncorhynchus mykiss irideus'') and [[Columbia River redband trout|redband trout]] (''O. m. gairdneri'') populations also display reddish or pink throat markings.  Inland subspecies of the cutthroat trout are distinguished from the coastal cutthroat, rainbow trout and cutbow hybrids by a distinct lack of spotting on the top of the head.<ref name=BehnkeOclarki/> At maturity, different populations and subspecies of cutthroats can range from {{convert|6|to|40|in|cm|abbr=on}} in length, depending on habitat and food availability. The sea-run forms of coastal cutthroat average {{convert|2|to|5|lbs|kg|1|abbr=on}}, while stream-resident forms attain much smaller sizes, {{convert|0.4|to|3.2|oz|g|abbr=on}}. [[lake|Lacustrine]] populations have attained weights from {{convert|12|to|17|lbs|kg|abbr=on}} in ideal conditions.<ref name=BehnkeOclarki/> The length and weights of mature inland forms vary widely depending on their particular environment and availability of food.  The largest of the cutthroat subspecies is the Lahontan cutthroat trout (''O. c. henshawi''). These fish average {{convert|8|to|9|in|cm|abbr=on}} in small streams and {{convert|8|to|22|in|cm|abbr=on}} in larger rivers and lakes. In ideal environments, the Lahonton cutthroat attains typical weights of {{convert|0.25|to|8|lbs|kg|abbr=on}}.<ref name=BehnkeOclarki/>  The world record cutthroat is a Lahonton at {{convert|39|in|cm|abbr=on}} and {{convert|41|lbs|kg|abbr=on}}.<ref name=IGFA/>

===Lifecycle===
Cutthroat trout usually inhabit and spawn in small to moderately large, clear, well-[[Oxygenation (environmental)|oxygenated]], shallow rivers with [[gravel]] bottoms. They are native to the alluvial or freestone streams that are typical tributaries of the Pacific Basin, Great Basin and Rocky Mountains.  They spawn in the spring, as early as February in coastal rivers and as late as July in high mountain lakes and streams.  Spawning begins when water temperatures reach 43 to 46<U+00B0>F (6 to 8<U+00B0>C).<ref name=BehnkeOclarki/>  Lake-resident cutthroat trout are usually found in moderately deep, cool lakes with adequate shallows and vegetation for good food production. Lake populations generally require access to gravel-bottomed streams to be self-sustaining, but occasionally spawn on shallow gravel beds with good water circulation.<ref name=BehnkeOclarki/>

Cutthroats naturally interbreed with the closely related rainbow trout, producing fertile [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrids]] commonly called "cutbows". As this hybrid generally bears similar coloration and overall appearance to the cutthroat, retaining the characteristic orange-red slash, these hybrids often pose a taxonomical difficulty.<ref name=Halverson>{{cite book |last=Halverson |first=Anders |title=An Entirely Synthetic Fish: How Rainbow Trout Beguiled America and Overran the World |chapter=A Single New Mongrel Species |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven, CT |pages=145<U+2013>164 |isbn=978-0-300-14087-3 |year=2010}}</ref> In addition, cutthroats may hybridize with the ''O. gilae'' subspecies, the [[Gila trout]] and [[Apache trout]] in regions where their ranges overlap.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fws.gov/southwest/es/arizona/Documents/SpeciesDocs/Apache_Trout/Apache%20Trout%20Recovery%20Plan%202nd%20Revision.pdf |title=Apache Trout ''Oncorhynchus apache'' Recovery Plan |publisher=U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service |date=August 2009 |format=PDF |accessdate=2013-12-25}}</ref>

Cutthroat trout are native to western North America. The cutthroat species has evolved through [[geographic isolation]] into many subspecies, each native to a different major [[drainage basin]].

Cutthroat trout are [[List of feeding behaviours|opportunistic feeders]]. Stream-resident cutthroats primarily feed on [[larva]]l, [[pupa]]l and adult forms of aquatic insects (typically [[Caddisfly|caddisflies]], [[Plecoptera|stoneflies]], [[mayflies]] and aquatic [[fly|diptera]]ns), and adult forms of terrestrial insects (typically [[ant]]s, [[beetle]]s, [[grasshopper]]s and [[Cricket (insect)|cricket]]s) that fall into the water, fish eggs, small fish, along with crayfish, shrimp and other crustaceans. As they grow the proportion of fish consumed increases in most populations.

Various subspecies of cutthroat trout are raised in commercial, state and federal [[fish hatchery|hatcheries]] for introduction into suitable native and non-native riverine and lacustrine environments. In the early 20th century, several hatcheries were established in Yellowstone National Park by the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service|U.S. Bureau of Fisheries]].  These hatcheries not only produced stocks of the Yellowstone cutthroat trout (''O. c. bouvieri'') for the park, but also took advantage of the great spawning stock of cutthroat trout to supply eggs to hatcheries around the U.S.  Between 1901 and 1953, 818 million trout eggs were exported from the park to hatcheries throughout the U.S.<ref name=Grand100>{{Cite journal|last=Franke |first=Mary Ann |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1996 |month=Fall |title=A Grand Experiment<U+2014>100 Years of Fisheries Management in Yellowstone: Part I |journal=Yellowstone Science |volume=4 |issue=4 |pages=5 |id= |url= |accessdate= |quote= }}</ref>  The Lahontan National Fish Hatchery operated by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service exists to restore populations of the Lahontan cutthroat trout (''O. c. lahontan'') in  [[Pyramid Lake (Nevada)|Pyramid]], [[Walker Lake (Nevada)|Walker]], [[Fallen Leaf Lake (California)|Fallen Leaf]], [[June Lake (California)|June]], Marlette, and Gull Lakes and the [[Truckee River]] in California and Nevada.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fws.gov/lahontannfhc/lnfh.html |title=The Lahontan National Fish Hatchery |publisher=U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service |accessdate=2013-12-20}}</ref> The hatchery produces about 300,000&ndash;400,000 Lahonton cutthroat trout fry annually.

== Population threats ==
[[File:Oncorhynchus clarkii bouvieri 1904.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Colored drawing of Yellowstone cutthroat trout from 1904 book|Yellowstone cutthroat from ''Birds and Nature'', 1904]]
The historic native range of cutthroat trout has been reduced by [[overfishing]], urbanization and habitat loss due to mining, grazing and logging.  Population densities have been reduced and in some cases populations have disappeared though competition with non-native [[brook trout|brook]], brown and rainbow trout, which were introduced in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.<ref name=BehnkeOclarki/>  The most serious current threats to several subspecies are [[Hybrid (biology)#Interspecific hybrids|interspecific breeding]] with introduced rainbow trout creating hybrid cutbows and [[Hybrid (biology)|intraspecific breeding]] with other introduced cutthroat subspecies. In the [[Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem]], the presence of [[lake trout]] (''Salvelinus namaycush'') in [[Yellowstone Lake]] in Yellowstone National Park has caused serious decline in (''O. c. bouvieri''). Outbreaks of [[Myxobolus cerebralis|whirling disease]] in major spawning tributaries within the native ranges have also caused declines.<ref name="lake trout">{{cite web| title =The Yellowstone Lake Crisis: Confronting a Lake Trout Invasion| work =| publisher =National Park Service| url =http://www.nps.gov/yell/planyourvisit/upload/laketrout2.pdf| format = PDF |year=1995| accessdate = 2007-03-19}}</ref>

'''Interspecific and intraspecific breeding'''

The most serious impact on the genetic purity of most cutthroat trout subspecies results from interspecific and intraspecific breeding resulting in hybrids that carry the [[gene]]s of both parents.  In inland populations, the introduction of rainbow trout from hatchery stocks have resulted in cutbow hybrids that continue to diminish the genetic purity of many cutthroat subspecies.  The introduction of hatchery-raised Yellowstone cutthroat trout into native ranges of other cutthroat subspecies, particularly the westslope cutthroat trout, has resulted in intraspecific breeding and diminished genetic purity of the westslope subspecies.  As such, populations of genetically pure westslope cutthroat trout are very rare and localized in streams above barriers to upstream migrations by introduced species.<ref name=Halverson/> Fisheries biologist [[Robert J. Behnke]] attributes the extinction of the yellowfin cutthroat trout (''O. c. macdonaldi'') and Alvord cutthroat trout (''O. c. alvordensis'') subspecies to the introduction of non-native rainbow trout.<ref>{{cite book |last=Behnke |first=Robert J. |title=Trout and Salmon of North America |coauthors=Tomelleri, Joseph R.

'''Decline of the Yellowstone cutthroat'''
[[File:AnglersYellowstone-Haynes1897.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Old photo of anglers with a lot of fish from Yellowstone Lake|Anglers at West Thumb, 1897, with a harvest of Yellowstone cutthroat trout]]
The population at the core of the Yellowstone cutthroat trout's native range, in Yellowstone Lake, crashed in the 1960s due to overharvest of fish by anglers and eggs by hatchery personnel in the early 20th century. A change in management approach to [[catch and release]] fishing and termination of hatchery operations in the park allowed the cutthroats to recover.<ref name=ynpfishes>{{cite book|last=Schullery |first=Paul |authorlink=Paul Schullery |coauthors=Varley, John D. |title=Yellowstone Fishes<U+2014>Ecology, History, and Angling in the Park |publisher=Stackpole Books |location=Mechanicsburg, PA |year=1998 |isbn=0-8117-2777-7 |chapter=Wilderness Defined-The Evolution of an Ideal |pages=90<U+2013>101}}</ref>  Then in 1994, park officials discovered lake trout in Yellowstone Lake. Although lake trout were established in [[Shoshone Lake|Shoshone]], [[Lewis Lake (Wyoming)|Lewis]] and [[Heart Lake (Wyoming)|Heart]] Lakes in the Snake River drainage from U.S. government stocking operations in 1890, they were never officially introduced into the Yellowstone River drainage and their presence there is probably the result of accidental or illegal introductions.<ref name="lake trout"/><ref>{{cite book |last=Kendall |first=W.

'''Whirling disease'''

Most subspecies of cutthroat trout are highly susceptible to whirling disease, (''Myxobolus cerebralis''). The Snake River fine-spotted cutthroat trout appears to be resistant to the parasite.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://whirlingdisease.montana.edu/pdfs/TU_Report_99.pdf |title=Whirling Disease in the United States |publisher=[[Trout Unlimited]] |date= January 1999 |author=David Nickum |format=PDF}}</ref>
