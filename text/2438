'''''Fire''''' ({{lang-hi|<U+092B><U+093E><U+092F><U+0930>}}) is a 1996 film directed and written by [[Deepa Mehta]], starring [[Shabana Azmi]] and [[Nandita Das]]. It is the first of Mehta's "Elements" [[trilogy]]. It is followed by ''[[Earth (1998 film)|Earth]]'' (1998) and ''[[Water (2005 film)|Water]]'' (2005). 

The film is loosely based on [[Ismat Chugtai]]'s 1941 story ''Lihaf'' (The Quilt) <ref>{{cite book| last = Gopinath| first = Gayatri| title = Impossible Desires| format = Book| year = 2005| publisher = Duke University press| location = Durham and London}} </ref>. It is the first Indian film to explicitly show homosexual relations. After its 1998 release in India, right-wing Hindu groups staged several violent protests, setting off a flurry of public dialogue around issues such as [[homosexuality]] and [[freedom of speech]].

== Plot==
The film is set in contemporary [[Delhi]], [[India]], in the household of a [[joint family]] which runs a fast-food and video business in the ground floor of their two-storey home. The protagonists are the two daughters-in-law, both of whom have joined the family by [[arranged marriage]]: Sita ([[Nandita Das]]), who is newly wed to the younger son Jatin ([[Javed Jaffrey]]); and Radha ([[Shabana Azmi]]), who has been married to the elder son Ashok ([[Kulbhushan Kharbanda]]) for 15 years. 
Both couples are unhappy. Jatin, who feels he has been pressured into marriage by the family, neglects Sita and continues to see his Chinese girlfriend. Ashok has chosen to become a [[Tapas (Sanskrit)|tapasvin]] (an [[ascetic]]) after discovering that Radha is infertile, and has been using her to test his resolve in celibacy for 13 years. The two women turn to each other for solace and become lovers. Tipped off by a servant, Ashok discovers them in bed together. Sita leaves, while Radha, who wishes to explain matters to Ashok, promises to meet her at the [[Nizamuddin Dargah]] to start a new life together. In the confrontation that follows, Radha's sari catches fire from the kitchen stove and Ashok abandons her in flames. In the final scene, the two women are reunited.

==Events surrounding screenings of ''Fire'' in India==
''Fire'' was passed uncut by India's censor board (the [[Central Board of Film Certification]]) in May 1998 with a rating of ''Adult'', the only condition being that the character Sita's name be changed to Nita.<ref name="IndiaToday"/> The film was first screened on 13 Nov 1998 and ran to full houses in most metropolitan cities throughout India for almost 3 weeks.

On December 2, more than 200  [[Shiv Sena|Shiv Sanaiks]] stormed a Cinemax theatre in suburban [[Goregaon]] in [[Mumbai]], smashing glass panes, burning posters and shouting slogans. They compelled managers to refund tickets to moviegoers. On Dec 3, a Regal theatre in [[Delhi]] was similarly stormed.  Bajrang Dal workers with [[lathi]]s invaded Rajpalace and Rajmahal in Surat, breaking up everything in sight and driving away frightened audiences. Theatres in Surat and Pune stopped screening the film on the same day. When attackers attempted to shut down a screening in [[Calcutta]], however, ushers and audience fought back and the movie stayed open. Twenty-nine people were arrested in Mumbai in connection with these incidents.<ref name="IndiaToday">{{Citation

On December 7,  [[Deepa Mehta]] led a candlelit protest in New Delhi with activists from 32 organizations against the withdrawal of ''Fire'', carrying placards, shouting anti-[[Shiv Sena]] slogans  and crying for the freedom of right to expression.<ref> Unknown Author. "Candle-light protest against withdrawal of controversial film", ''[[BBC]] Summary of World Broadcasts'', December 9, 1998.

==Reception==

In the initial weeks following the release of ''Fire'', reviewers praised the film's explicit depiction of a homosexual relationship as "gutsy" <ref> "That Burning Feeling", ''[[Times of India]]'', November 20, 1998. Accessed March 16, 2008.</ref>, "explosive", <ref> Mullick, Swapan. "Explosive Power of the Woman", ''[[The Statesman]]'', November 26, 1998. Accessed March 14, 2008. </ref> "pathbreaking". <ref> Somaaya, Bhawana. "Year of Unusuals", ''[[The Hindu]]'', November 27, 2008. Accessed March 13, 2008.</ref> Following the [[Shiv Sena]] attacks on the film, prominent party members said ''Fire'' had been targeted because it was an "immoral and pornographic" film "against Indian tradition and culture." The [[lesbian]] relationship depicted in the film was criticized as "not a part of Indian history or culture." <ref> Kidwai, Saleem. "Sena fury on Fire," ''[[The Independent (Bangladesh)|The Independent']]', February 5 1999. Accessed March 12, 2008.</ref> <ref name="Reuters1"/> <ref> Trehan, Madhu.

Accessed March 14, 2008.</ref> Other politicians of the Hindu right voiced fears that the film would "spoil [Indian] women" and younger generations by teaching "unhappy wives not to depend on their husbands" and informing the public about "acts of perversion." <ref name="activistsslam"> "Activists slam attacks on lesbian film, Hindus vow to widen protest," ''[[Agence France-Presse]]'', December 3, 1998. Accessed March 13, 2008.</ref> Speaking on the dangers of ''Fire'', [[Shiv Sena]] chief [[Bal Thackery]] compared [[lesbianism]] to "a sort of a social AIDS" which might "spread like an epidemic." <ref name="QueeringIndia"/> <ref> Ghosh, Shohini and Madhavi Shahani Kapur. [http://www.cscsarchive.org:8081/__e52568520028afa7.nsf/0/6d89e7d5733ec1456525693e005c85d4!OpenDocument "From the frying pan to the Fire, Fear of Fire], ''Communalism Combat'', January 1 1999. Accessed March 11, 2008. </ref> <ref name="NewYorkTimes1"/> Furthermore, Thackery claimed that the film was an attack on [[Hinduism]] because the protagonists were named [[Sita]] and [[Radha]], both significant goddesses in [[Hindu]] belief, and that he would withdraw his objections to the film if the names were changed to [[Muslim]] names.<ref> "Hindu leader says lesbian film should be about Moslem family", ''[[Agence France-Presse]]'', December 14, 1998. Accessed March 12, 2008. </ref>

A statement issued from the Shiv Sena's women's wing said, "If women's physical needs get fulfilled through lesbian acts, the institution of marriage will collapse, reproduction of human beings will stop." <ref> McGirk, Tim. [http://www.time.com/time/asia/asia/magazine/1998/981221/under_fire1.html "Plenty of Smoke Over Fire"] ''[[Time Asia]]'' December 21, 1998. Accessed March 13, 2008. </ref> <ref name="QueeringIndia"/> Critics charged the Shiv Sena of committing "cultural terrorism" <ref name="Reuters1"> "Indian activists force cinema to call off 'Fire'", ''[[Reuters News]]'', 18 December 1998. Accessed 11 March 2008.</ref> and of using the rhetoric of "Indian tradition" to protest images of female independence and suppress freedom of speech. <ref> Menon, Ritu. [http://www.indianexpress.com/res/web/pIe/ie/daily/19981209/34350564.html "The fire within"], ''[[The Indian Express]]'', December 9, 1998. Accessed 13 March, 2008.</ref> "The justification for [Shiv Sena's] action... demonstrates that Indian 'culture' for the [[Sangh Parivar]] is defined essentially in terms of male control over female sexuality." <ref name="QueeringIndia"/> <ref> Upadhya, Carol. "Set This House on Fire", ''[[Economic and Political Weekly]]'', December 12, 1998, 3176-77.</ref>

Gay activist [[Ashok Row Kavi]] criticized the [[Shiv Sena]]'s protests as "gay-bashing" and disputed their claims that lesbianism was "against Indian tradition", indicating that [[homosexuality]] is in fact abundantly present in [[Hinduism]] and that the criminalization of [[homosexuality]] was a legacy of [[British colonialism]], heavily informed by [[Christianity]]. <ref name="activistsslam"/> Pointing to evidence of lesbianism in Indian tradition, he said, "What's wrong in two women having sex? If they think it doesn't happen in the Indian society they should see the sculptures of [[Khajuraho]] or [[Konark]]." <ref name="QueeringIndia"/> <ref> [http://www.indianexpress.com/res/web/pIe/ie/daily/19981203/33750654.html "Sena attacks theatres to douse Fire"], ''[[The Indian Express]]'', December 3, 1998. Accessed March 10, 2008. </ref> [[Madhu Kishwar]], then-editor of ''[[Manushi]]'', wrote a highly critical review of ''Fire'', finding fault with the depiction of the characters in the film as a "mean spirited caricature of middle class family life among urban Hindus". She claimed that homosexuality was socially accepted in India as long as it remained a private affair, adding that [[Deepa Mehta|Mehta]] "did a disservice to the cause of women... by crudely pushing the Radha-Sita relationship into the [[lesbian]] mould," as women would now be unable to form intimate relationships with other women without being branded as lesbians. <ref> Kishwar, Madhu. [http://www.cscsarchive.org:8081/__e5256852001e3a90.nsf/0/df4e59a95be275e06525693f001ae98e!OpenDocument&Highlight=0,fire,kishwar "Naive Outpourings of a Self-Hating Indian: Deepa Mehta<U+2019>s Fire"], ''[[Manushi]]'', January 1, 1998. Accessed March 15, 2008.</ref>
Kishwar in turn received criticism for claiming that homophobia did not exist in India, and for failing to acknowledge the rights of [[homosexuals]] to publicly assert their identities in India. <ref name="QueeringIndia"/>

[[Deepa Mehta]] expressed frustration in interviews that the film was consistently described as a lesbian film. She said, "lesbianism is just another aspect of the film...''Fire'' is not a film about lesbians," but rather about "the choices we make in life." <ref> Verma, Suparn.
