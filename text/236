The '''Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Faith and Native Americans''' has a history reaching back to the lifetime of [[`Abdu'l-Bah<U+00E1>]] and has multiplied its relationships across the Americas. Individuals have joined the religion and institutions have been founded to serve native Americans and have native Americans serve on Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> institutions.

By 1963 Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> sources claim members of some 83 tribes of Native Americans had joined the religion.<ref name="stats">{{cite book | title = The Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Faith: 1844-1963: Information Statistical and Comparative, Including the Achievements of the Ten Year International Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Teaching & Consolidation Plan 1953-1963 | publisher = [[Hand of the Cause|Hands of the Cause]] Residing in the Holy Land | year = 1963  | location = Haifa, Israel | page = 19 | url = http://bahai-library.com/handscause_statistics_1953-63&chapter=1#22 | isbn = }}</ref> In North America diversification is an ever-present theme in Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> history.

[[Shoghi Effendi]], head of the religion 1921-1957, stated: "The fundamental principle enunciated by [[Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h]], the followers of his Faith firmly believe, is that religious truth is not absolute but relative, that Divine Revelation is a continuous and progressive process, that all the great religions of the world are divine in origin, that their basic principles are in complete harmony, that their aims and purposes are one and the same, that their teachings are but facets of one truth, that their functions are complementary, that they differ only in the nonessential aspects of their doctrines, and that their missions represent successive stages in the spiritual evolution of human society."<ref>{{Cite book  | last = Effendi  | first = Shoghi  | authorlink = Shoghi Effendi| title = The Promised Day Is Come   | publisher = US Bah<U+00E1><U+2019><U+00ED> Publishing Trust  | date = 1980 revised edition   | page =  v  | url = http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/PDC/pdc-1.html#gr1  | isbn = }}</ref> In addition to the "great religions" members and institutions of the Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Faith have extended affirmation to various religious faith traditions as among the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas]] and other continents.<ref name="Buck">{{Cite journal | last = Buck | first = Christopher | title = Native Messengers of God in Canada?

Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> [[Pioneering (Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>)|pioneers]] to regions with aboriginal peoples have extended [[Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Faith and the unity of religion|Bah<U+00E1><U+2019><U+00ED> universalism]] in religion to a recognition of the richness and authenticity of native cultural values. Such recognition has been supported by local Bah<U+00E1><U+2019><U+00ED> policy validating the concept of First Nations [[Manifestations of God]]. Although theoretically acknowledged, explicit recognition of native messengers of God has yet to be formalised in Bah<U+00E1><U+2019><U+00ED> doctrine. The quote from an authenticated source most directly reflecting on the issue is:
<blockquote>
In ancient times the people of America were, through their northern regions, close to Asia, that is, separated from Asia by a strait. For this reason, it hath been said that crossing had occurred. There are other signs which indicate communication.

As to places whose people were not informed of the appearance of Prophets, such people are excused. In the Qur<U+2019><U+00E1>n it hath been revealed: <U+201C>We will not chastise them if they had not been sent a Messenger<U+201D> (Q. 17:15).

Undoubtedly in those regions the Call of God must have been raised in ancient times, but it hath been forgotten now.<ref name="Buck"/></blockquote>
In this particular context, the expression <U+201C>Call of God<U+201D> (nid<U+00E1>-yi il<U+00E1>h<U+00ED>) is a transparent reference to Prophets of God and who give [[revelation]].

In 1912 `Abdu'l-Bah<U+00E1> took a journey to the West from Chicago that included a trip to Canada and through the mid-West with stops in a few cities. As he was leaving Canada, on the way back to the States, he traveled through several villages .<ref>A portion of Van den Hoonaard's book is posted online along with rare pictures at {{Cite web | title = The Bah<U+00E1><U+2019><U+00ED> Faith comes to Hamilton  | work = | publisher = The Baha'i Community of Hamilton, Ontario, Canada | date = | url =http://www.bahaihamilton.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=3&Itemid=9| accessdate = 2010-05-}}</ref> Perhaps most interesting is that the train passed through the town of [[Belleville, Ontario|Belleville]] at 1:47pm according to researcher Will C.

In May 1948 he became one of the first native American Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>s of Canada.<ref name="Vanden">{{Cite book | last = Van den Hoonaard | first = Will C. | title = The Origins of the Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Community of Canada; 1898<U+2013>1948 | publisher = Wilfrid Laurier University Press | year = 1996 | location = Canada | pages = 43<U+2013>63| url = http://books.google.com/books?id=znXIbkNA1nQC&lpg=PA247&ots=9DqlD6REsD&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q=&f=false | isbn = 9780889202726}}</ref>

===`Abdu'l-Bah<U+00E1>'s Tablets of the Divine Plan===
`Abdu'l-Bah<U+00E1>, the son of the founder of the religion, wrote a series of letters, or [[tablets (religious)|tablets]], to the followers of the religion in the [[United States]] in 1916-1917; these letters were compiled together in the book ''[[Tablets of the Divine Plan]]''. The sixth of the tablets was the first to mention [[Latin America]]n regions and was written on April 8, 1916, but was delayed in being presented in the United States until 1919<U+2014>after the end of the [[World War I|First World War]] and the [[Spanish flu]]. The sixth tablet was translated and presented by [[Mirza Ahmad Sohrab]] on April 4, 1919, and published in ''[[Star of the West (Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> magazine)|Star of the West]]'' magazine on December 12, 1919.<ref>{{cite book | last = Abbas | first = `Abdu'l-Bah<U+00E1> | coauthors = Mirza Ahmad Sohrab, trans. and comments | title = Tablets, Instructions and Words of Explanation | year = 1919 | month = April | url =http://bahai-library.com/abdulbaha_tablets_instructions_explanation}}</ref> After mentioning the need for the message of the religion to visit the Latin American countries `Abdu'l-Bah<U+00E1> continued:

<blockquote>Attach great importance to the indigenous population of America. For these souls may be likened unto the ancient inhabitants of the Arabian Peninsula, who, prior to the Mission of Mu<U+1E25>ammad, were like unto savages. When the light of Mu<U+1E25>ammad shone forth in their midst, however, they became so radiant as to illumine the world.

===Cultural relationships and challenges===

The cultural norms in the Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Faith have gone through major transitions.<ref name="Christchurch">{{Cite book| last = Momen | first = Moojan | editor-last = McGlinn | editor-first = Sen | title = Soundings: Essays in Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Theology | publisher = : Open Circle Publishing | chapter =Is the Baha'i Faith a World Religion? | chapterurl =http://bahai-library.com/momen_bahai_world_religion | year = 1989 | location = Christchurch, NZ | pages = 55<U+2013>64 | url = | isbn = }}</ref> The first occurred at about the turn of the 20th century when the religion became known beyond its mainly Muslim Middle-Eastern population and spread to Christian North America and Europe. The foundations of this achievement had been laid from the earliest days of the new religion when [[Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h]] in two of his writings from the Baghdad period addressed Christian issues. Then towards the end of the nineteenth century, the famous Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> scholar, [[M<U+00ED>rz<U+00E1> Abu'l-Fadl]], extended these foundations by writing extensively on Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> approaches to the New and Old Testaments. This was followed by the conversion of numerous Jews, in Iran, and Christians, in Syria and Egypt, to the religion. It was Syrian Christian converts in particular who were largely responsible for taking the Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Faith to Christian North America, from where there was further spread to Europe and Australia. See also [[`Abdu'l-Bah<U+00E1>'s journeys to the West]]. The second major breakthrough started post-World War II when the religion began to spread rapidly in the villages of the Third World. Some idea of the extent of this comparatively sudden change can be gleaned from the fact that prior to 1954, approximately 94% of the world Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> population consisted of Iranians.

Unlike the spread of Christianity within Indian country in the United States, the Bah<U+00E1><U+2018><U+00ED> Faith has never been associated with a fortification of colonial occupation, Euro-American assimilation, or forced conversions of Native Americans. Indeed in 1960 [[Hand of the Cause]] [[R<U+00FA>h<U+00ED>yyih Kh<U+00E1>num]] asked for forgiveness for the injustices her race had done and praised their great past.<ref name="Addison&Buck"/> And in 1963 anthropologist [[Alice Beck Kehoe]], a well known researcher of Native Americans, observed that the Bah<U+00E1><U+2018><U+00ED> Faith is considered by its members to be a universal faith, not tied to any one particular culture, religious background, language, or even country of origin. However one researcher, based on experience as a scholar and elder of in an Indian tribe, observed in 2007: "Most white Canadians and Americans have no clue with respect to how constantly they reinforce their own cultural assumptions, right or wrong, and pile them upon Indians, never willing or even interested in hearing our own Native view. I agree that the Bah<U+00E1><U+2018><U+00ED>s in Canada and the U.S. have made some good headway in the honoring and validating native spiritual prophecies and principles. However, much more transformation along the lines of intercultural interactions within the Bah<U+00E1><U+2018><U+00ED> international community needs to take place. In particular, I am referring specifically to most (but not all) of our non-Native Bah<U+00E1><U+2018><U+00ED>s who find it impossible to break through the inner barriers of their own Euro-American culture."<ref name="Addison&Buck"/>

In a context of difficulties in relationships between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal peoples there is a pattern on the one hand of indigenous efforts of entrenched violent confrontation for self-determination and on the other of wholesale romanticization of Native culture, religion, and lifestyle. The Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> encounter with Aboriginals in British Colombia was observed by another anthropologist that, while not fully transformed, the Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Faith's encounter with Indians was a forceful illustration that something between the extremes was possible between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal peoples. While the goals of equality and unity in diversity had yet to be fully realized within the Bah<U+00E1><U+2019><U+00ED> community, the religion has nevertheless served as a potent source of empowerment for Aboriginal adherents. Adoption of the Bah<U+00E1><U+2019><U+00ED> Faith has not entailed a stark renunciation of preexisting forms of Aboriginal belief, practice, or identity. Rather, it has served as a firm source of confirmation and connection, reinforcing the validity of Aboriginal culture and fostering pride in Aboriginal heritage. However relatively few of the over nine hundred Aboriginal people who enrolled in the Bah<U+00E1><U+2018><U+00ED> Faith in British Columbia between 1948 and 1992 ultimately became active adherent and despite such empowering impact, patterns of non-Aboriginal cultural dominance encountered within the Bah<U+00E1><U+2018><U+00ED> community simultaneously suggest the pervasiveness of the colonial legacy and the potency of contemporary social context; good intentions proved insufficient to fully transform intercultural interactions.<ref>{{Cite thesis | last = Horton  | first = Chelsea Dawn   | title = <U+201C>As ye have faith so shall your powers and blessings be<U+201D>: The Aboriginal-Bah<U+00E1><U+2019><U+00ED> Encounter in British Columbia  | publisher =Dept. of History, Simon Fraser University  (Masters of Arts Thesis)  | location =   | year = 2005| url =http://ir.lib.sfu.ca/retrieve/3418/1763.pdf | accessdate = 2010-05-30}}</ref> But there is progress in appreciation of Indian cultural and spiritual experience coming through Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> publishing channels<ref>{{Cite book | last =  Medina | first = John Fitzgerald | title = Faith, Physics, and Psychology: Rethinking Society and the Human Spirit | publisher = US Baha'i Publishing Trus | year = 2006  | chapter = The "Discovery" of the "New World" | chapterurl = http://books.google.com/books?id=wUgOM9FZUk0C&lpg=PP1&pg=PA197#v=onepage&q&f=false | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=wUgOM9FZUk0C&source=gbs_navlinks_s | isbn = 9781931847308 }}</ref> just as there has been of Islam over a century ago.<ref>For example some books by [[Stanwood Cobb]]:

===Systematic efforts===
[[Shoghi Effendi]], who was named `Abdu'l-Bah<U+00E1>'s successor, wrote a [[Telegraphy|cable]] on May 1, 1936 to the [[Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> administration#National|Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Annual Convention]] of the United States and Canada, and asked for the systematic implementation of `Abdu'l-Bah<U+00E1>'s vision to begin.<ref name="alamb"/>  In his cable he wrote:

Following the May 1st cable, another cable from Shoghi Effendi came on May 19 calling for permanent [[Pioneering (Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>)|pioneers]] to be established in all the countries of Latin America.

During the 1937 Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> North American Convention, Shoghi Effendi cabled advising the convention to prolong their deliberations to permit the delegates and the National Assembly to consult on a plan that would enable Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>s to go to Latin America as well as to include the completion of the outer structure of the [[Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> House of Worship]] in Wilmette, Illinois.<ref name="alamb">{{cite book | last = Lamb | first = Artemus | title = The Beginnings of the Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Faith in Latin America:Some Remembrances, English Revised and Amplified Edition | publisher = M L VanOrman Enterprises | year = 1995 | month = November | location = West Linn, OR | url = http://bahai-library.com/lamb_bahai_latin_america}}</ref>  In 1937 the ''First Seven Year Plan''  (1937<U+2013>44), which was an international plan designed by Shoghi Effendi, gave the American Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>s the goal of establishing the Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Faith in every country in Latin America.

In early 1973, Raul Pavon leased Radio Turismo station and initiated fourteen hours of daily broadcasts. None involved had backgrounding in running a radio station. Initial success was based on playing local and national music genre. In July 1973 the national assembly added the goal of a radio station to its budget and a committee to create programing. Programming was developed and aired in eight cities between 15-minute segments up to hour-long bilingual (Spanish-Quichua) programs of [[Prayer in the Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Faith|Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> prayers]], and drawing from [[Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> literature]] as well as information of its world-wide community. In 1975, training workshops were organized for scriptwriters. Other trainings continued in 1976. By 1976 the committee had produced 1286 hours of programming at a cost of approximately $2000 as well as documentation to support sister projects. A low-power [[Amplitude modulation|AM]] radio station which was finally granted in 1977. There were challenges of coordination and staffing to overcome. Outside trainers or professional staff were able to come in 1977, 1978, and 1980. A commission was developed, typically including a body composed of an indigenous person, a "white" person, technical experts, senior Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>s and a veteran of the station, with a balance of majority of local people while also one member to be literate and capable of dealing with the administration of the commission. 

With regular feedback from experienced institutions operating out of the [[Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> World Centre]], progress was maintained and Dr. David Ruhe, then a member of the [[Universal House of Justice]], visited in 1980 and acted as liaison between the radio station and the Audio-Visual Department at the Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> administrative offices.<ref name="Kurt"/> In 1980 almost the entire staff traveled to Peru to make extensive presentations to the international Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> media conference in [[Puno]] where the second Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Radio station would be set up. It was not until 1981 that a suitable director was able to take up service by combining the qualities of being a Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>, an experienced radio professional, and an Ecuadoran and able to volunteer. In addition to Quinteros, six other indigenous had systematically begun to serve at the station as full-time staff as well as larger numbers of part-time staff amounting to some 200 persons including indigenous youth in the first four years of the operation of the station. Indigenous staff were able to conduct workshops for other indigenous staff, in Spanish and Quichua, for the first time in 1981. Staff for projects in Bolivia, Chile and Peru participated in successive training and Ecuadoran staff traveled to Peru and Bolivia to assist in those projects. The Commission wrote to the Chilean Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>s about the development of their radio station that:

<blockquote>"The most important and indispensable thing is to maintain a happy, loving, spirited team-family. Try to have as high a percentage as possible of your staff native. At least 75%. It is far better to let a native do something wrong than not to give him the opportunity by having a foreigner do it."</blockquote>

By 1983 training of staff at Radio Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Ecuador was almost entirely in the hands of indigenous staff.<ref name="Kurt"/> There has also been training at the [[Amoz Gibson Training Center]] for Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Media in Puerto Rico operated by CIRBAL ([[Centro para Intercambio Radiofonico Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> de America Latina]].)

===The Trail of Light and Native Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Councils===
====First Native Bah<U+00E1><U+00B4><U+00ED> Council of North America====
During the international convention for the election of the [[Universal House of Justice]] in Haifa in April 1978 a meeting was held with representatives of the other circumpolar national Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> communities: Finland, Sweden, Norway, Iceland, Denmark (on behalf of Greenland), and Canada. It was decided then to form a ''Continental Indigenous Council'' committee under the supervision of the National Spiritual Assembly of Alaska, and a four-member Eskimo-Indian team was formed to travel for 45 days in 10 European countries during the summer. The Indian members of the team were Scott Tyler of the United States and Melba Loft of Canada; the Eskimos were Ida Bergamaschi and Maynard Eakan of Alaska.<ref>{{cite journal | title = Alaska - A Baha'i community grows, matures; | journal = Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> News | year = 1981 | month = October | number = 607 |ISSN=0195-9212 | page = p. 1<U+2013>6 | url =http://www.teachingandprojects.com/meansandmaterials.htm}}</ref> The idea for the Trail of Light occurred during preparations for the first Baha'i Native Council, held in 1978 on the [[Yakima Indian Reservation]] in Washington State when the national assemblies of Canada, Alaska and the United States were discussing the event. Another inspiration for the Trail of Light was the concept of promulgating the religion among the indigenous peoples in the [[Pacific Rim]] that was described by the [[Hand of the Cause]] [[Rahm<U+00E1>tu'llah Muh<U+00E1>jir]] in 1978. The Trail of Light, also known as ''Camino del Sol'', was defined as a process whereby native Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>s engaged with diverse native peoples about a number of issues including promulgating their religion as well as organizing councils for the people and encouraged discovery of mutual cultural links across the native peoples. The first ''Trail of Light'' traveling trip by 22 members of the religion occurred spontaneously immediately after the council.<ref name="BN594">{{cite journal | title = 'Trail of Light' Native American teaching effort follows North American Baha'i Native Council | journal = Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> News | year = 1980 | month = September | number = 594 |ISSN=0195-9212 | page = p. 6<U+2013>7 | url =http://www.teachingandprojects.com/meansandmaterials.htm}}</ref>

The traveled to the Guajira region and re-affirmed the religion among the Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>s there and the group performed dances which inspired the Guajiros to offer their own dance, the Chichamaya. The group was invited to the local high school where the Guaymis shared the story of the impact of the religion among their people (see [[Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Faith in Panama]].) The group was then invited to the elementary school. From Guajira the group headed to [[Valledupar]] and then on to the homeland of the [[Arhuaco]] tribe in the [[Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta]]. There the group met with the leadership, the Mamos, or elders of the community for permission to present the message they had come to give. Various of the group presented to the Mamos including the Guaymi and their interpretation of their own prophecies. An elder shared that the Arhuaco had a similar prophecy. The Trail of Light group was allowed to make their presentations and exchanges of dances and talks followed. From there the group traveled to see the [[Yukpa]] (Yuko) tribe. With the Yuko the group was able to hold a unity feast and shared dances and stayed for three days before heading home.

FUNDAEC is the Colombian NGO based on Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> consultations with Colombians starting in the 1970s and developed a number of projects like a secondary curriculum centered on skill development for living in the countryside and minimized [[urbanization]] for example. FUNDESCU is an older (from the 1950s) NGO in Panama based on Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> consultations with Panamanian Indians and developed a system of schools serving largely remote areas. An agricultural project was attempted in the 1990s and was in fact based on cooperation between the Panamanian and Colombian NGOs but it failed from differences.{{Citation | last = Rhodenbaugh | first = Molly Marie | title = The Ng<U+00F6>be Baha'is of Panama | thesis = MA Thesis in Anthrolopogy | publisher = [[Texas Tech University]] | month = August | year = 1999 | url =http://etd.lib.ttu.edu/theses/available/etd-10272008-31295016514407/unrestricted/31295016514407.pdf | pages=119<U+2013>123}}</ref> was founded by group of professors at the [[University of Valle]].<ref name="Club">{{Cite news | title = Baha'i-inspired educational system for the poor of the world honored by the Club of Budapest  | newspaper = Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> World News Service  | location = Frankfurt, Germany   | publisher =  Bah<U+00E1><U+2019><U+00ED> International Community  | date = 22 December 2002  | url =  http://news.bahai.org/story/185  | accessdate = 2010-05-08}}</ref> According to Gustav Correa, director of FUNDAEC, it was originally inspired by a quotation from [[Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h]]  -  "Baha'u'llah talks about man as 'a mine rich in gems of inestimable value.'

In Panama's remote indigenous villages Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> volunteers run ten primary schools where the government does not provide access to a school. Later a [[FUNDESCU]]<ref>FUNDESCU is different from [[FUNDAEC]] though there are many similarities. FUNDAEC is the Colombian NGO based on Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> consultations with Colombians starting in the 1970s and developed a number of projects like a secondary curriculum centered on skill development for living in the countryside and minimized[[urbanization]] for example. FUNDESCU is an older (from the 1950s) NGO in Panama based on Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> consultations with Panamanian Indians and developed a system of schools serving largely remote areas. An agricultural project was attempted in the 1990s and was in fact based on cooperation between the Panamanian and Colombian NGOs but it failed from differences. {{Cite thesis | last = Rhodenbaugh | first = Molly Marie | title = The Ng<U+00F6>be Baha'is of Panama | thesis = MA Thesis in Anthrolopogy | publisher = [[Texas Tech University]] | month = August | year = 1999 | url =http://etd.lib.ttu.edu/theses/available/etd-10272008-31295016514407/unrestricted/31295016514407.pdf | pages - 119<U+2013>123}}</ref> stipend of $50 per month was made available for 13 teachers and the Ministry of Education added funds for a 14th. As subsistence farmers, the villagers have no money or food to offer. Instead they take turns providing firewood for an outdoor kitchen or build small wood-framed shelters with corrugated zinc panels and a narrow wooden platform for a bed. The teachers and administrators do not seek to convert the students. Some of the villagers are Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>s, some are Catholics, some Evangelicals, and some follow the native [[Mama Tata]] religion. In all, about half the students are Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>s (about 150). Nevertheless there is a strong moral component to the program including a weekly class on "Virtues and Values." Over the years, some training for the teachers has been provided but many have not finished the twelfth grade including some women who have faced difficulties getting even that much education.<ref>{{Cite news  | last =  Gottlieb  | first = Randie  | title = In Panama's remote indigenous villages, Baha'i volunteers provide much needed educational services  | newspaper = Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> World News Service  | date = 2003-01-03  | url = http://news.bahai.org/story/186}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal  | last = Gottlieb  | first = Randie  | title = Victorino's Story - The establishment and rise of the first indigenous academic schools in the Ng<U+00E4>be-Bugl<U+00E9> Region of Chiriqui, Panama  | journal = Journal of the Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Community of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland  | volume = 19  | issue = 06  | pages =   | year = Nov/Dec 2002  | url = http://www.bahaijournal.org.uk/BJ200211/article2.htm}}</ref>
