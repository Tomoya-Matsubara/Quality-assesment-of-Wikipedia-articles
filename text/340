'''Pink Floyd''' were <!-- "were" is the preferred British-English expression for referring to a group. Please do not change it to the US equivalent "was".  --> an English [[Rock music|rock]] band who earned international recognition for their [[psychedelic rock]] music in the late 1960s, and for their [[progressive rock]] music from the 1970s onward. Their work is marked by the use of philosophical lyrics, [[Acoustics|sonic experimentation]], innovative [[album art]], and elaborate [[Pink Floyd live performances|live shows]]. One of rock music's most critically acclaimed and commercially successful acts, the group have sold over 200&nbsp;million albums worldwide, including 74.5&nbsp;million certified units in the United States, making them one of the [[list of best-selling music artists|best-selling music artists]] of all time.

Pink Floyd were formed in 1965, and originally consisted of university students [[Roger Waters]], [[Nick Mason]], [[Richard Wright (musician)|Richard Wright]], and [[Syd Barrett]]. The group were a popular fixture on London's underground music scene, and under Barrett's  leadership released two charting singles, "[[Arnold Layne]]" and "[[See Emily Play]]", and a successful debut album, ''[[The Piper at the Gates of Dawn]]''. In 1968, guitarist and singer [[David Gilmour]] joined the line-up.  Barrett was soon removed, due to his increasingly erratic behaviour.  Following Barrett's departure, bass player and singer Roger Waters became the lyricist and dominant figure in the band, which went on to achieve worldwide critical and commercial success with the [[concept albums]] ''[[The Dark Side of the Moon]]'', ''[[Wish You Were Here (Pink Floyd album)|Wish You Were Here]]'', ''[[Animals (album)|Animals]]'', and ''[[The Wall]]''.

Wright left the band in 1979, and Waters in 1985, but Gilmour and Mason (rejoined by Wright) continued recording and touring under the name Pink Floyd.  Waters used legal means to try to keep them from using the name, declaring Pink Floyd a spent force, but the parties reached an out-of-court settlement allowing Gilmour, Mason and Wright to continue as Pink Floyd.  The band again enjoyed worldwide successes with ''[[A Momentary Lapse of Reason]]'' (1987) and ''[[The Division Bell]]'' (1994), and Waters continued as a solo musician, releasing three studio albums.  Although for some years relations between Waters and the remaining three members were sour, the band reformed in 2005 for a final one-off performance at [[Live 8]].

==History==
===Early years (1963<U+2013>1967)===
====Formation====
Nick Mason and Roger Waters first met while studying architecture at the [[University of Westminster|Regent Street Polytechnic]] in [[London]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|pp=15<U+2013>19}}</ref>  The pair first played together in a band formed by Keith Noble and [[Clive Metcalfe]], with Noble's sister Sheilagh.  Fellow student Richard Wright joined later, and the band became a sextet, taking the name Sigma&nbsp;6.<ref name="Blakepp3839"/>  Waters initially played rhythm guitar before switching to bass, and Wright's girlfriend was a regular guest artist.  The band performed initially during private functions, rehearsing in a [[tearoom]] in the basement of Regent Street Polytechnic.  They played songs by [[The Searchers (band)|The Searchers]], and also material written by fellow student Ken Chapman, who became their manager and songwriter.<ref name="Blakepp3839">{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|pp=38<U+2013>39}}</ref>

In September 1963 Mason and Waters moved into the lower flat of Stanhope Gardens, owned by Mike Leonard, a part-time tutor at the Regent Street Polytechnic.  Leonard was a designer of light machines (perforated discs spun by electric motors to cast patterns of lights on the walls){{#tag:ref|These would be demonstrated in an early edition of ''[[Tomorrow's World]]''|group="nb"}} and for a time played keyboard alongside them, using the front room of the flat for rehearsals.<ref name="Masonpp2426">{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|pp=24<U+2013>26}}</ref>  Mason later moved out of the flat, while accomplished guitar player [[Bob Klose]] moved in.  Sigma&nbsp;6 changed their name on several occasions, from the Megadeaths, to the Architectural Abdabs, and then to The Tea Set.<ref name="Masonpp2426"/><ref>{{Harvnb|Schaffner|1991|pp=27<U+2013>28}}</ref>

{{Quote box |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=center |align=right |width=33% |quote=In a period when everyone was being cool in a very adolescent, self-conscious way, Syd was unfashionably outgoing; my enduring memory of our first encounter is the fact that he bothered to come up and introduce himself to me.|source=Nick Mason<ref name="Masonp27"/>}}

Metcalfe and Noble left to form their own band,<ref name="Blakep41">{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|p=41}}</ref> but in 1964 Klose and Waters were joined at Stanhope Gardens by [[Syd Barrett]].<ref name="Blakep41"/>  Then aged&nbsp;17,<ref name="Blakep13">{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|p=13}}</ref> Barrett had arrived in London in late 1963, to study at [[Camberwell College of Art]].<ref name="Masonp27">{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|p=27}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|p=33}}</ref>  Waters and Barrett were childhood friends; the bassist had often visited Barrett as he played guitar at his mother's house.<ref name="Schaffnerpp2223">{{Harvnb|Schaffner|1991|pp=22<U+2013>23}}</ref>

==== As The Pink Floyd Sound ====
With the Tea Set lacking Noble and Metcalfe's vocals, Klose introduced the band to Chris Dennis, a technician with the [[Royal Air Force]].<ref name="Blakepp4244">{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|pp=42<U+2013>44}}</ref>  It was during Dennis's tenure that the band was first referred to as The Pink Floyd Sound,{{#tag:ref|The sources used in this article suggest different dates for the first billing of this name, and therefore this article is purposely ambiguous.|group="nb"}} created by Barrett on the spur of the moment when he discovered that another band, also named the Tea Set, were to perform at one of their gigs.  The name is derived from the given names of two [[blues]] musicians whose records Barrett had in his collection, [[Pink Anderson]] and [[Floyd Council]].<ref name="Schaffnerp30">{{Harvnb|Schaffner|1991|p=30}}</ref><ref name="Masonpp3337">{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|pp=33<U+2013>37}}</ref>  Dennis was posted to [[Bahrain]], thrusting Barrett into the spotlight as frontman.<ref name="Blakepp4244"/>  They first performed in a recording studio in December 1964, minus the presence of Wright, who was taking a break from his studies.  Through one of his friends, who let them use some "down time" for free, they managed to secure recording time at a studio in West Hampstead.  This four-song session became the Tea Set's first demo tape, and included the R&B classic "I'm A King Bee", two Syd Barrett originals: "Butterfly" and "Lucy Leave", and "Double O Bo", a group-composition which<U+2014>according to Mason<U+2014>was "Bo Diddley meets the 007 theme."<ref>{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|pp=29<U+2013>30}}</ref>

The Pink Floyd Sound became the resident band at the Countdown Club near [[Kensington High Street]] in London, where from late night until early morning they played three sets of 90&nbsp;minutes.  According to Mason, this period "<U+2026>&nbsp;was the beginning of a realisation that songs could be extended with lengthy solos."<ref>{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|p=30}}</ref>  An audition for [[ITV]]'s ''[[Ready Steady Go!]]'' soon followed (they were invited by the programme's producers to return the following week), as did another club, and two rock contests.  At the behest of his father and college tutors, Bob Klose left in 1965,<ref>{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|pp=29<U+2013>32}}</ref> and Barrett took over on lead guitar.<ref>{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|p=45}}</ref>  Playing mostly [[rhythm and blues]] songs, they began to receive paid bookings, including one for a performance at the [[Marquee Club]] in March 1966, where they were watched by [[Peter Jenner]].  A lecturer at the [[London School of Economics]], Jenner was impressed by the acoustic effects Barrett and Wright created,<ref name="Masonpp3337"/> and with his business partner and friend [[Andrew King (music manager)|Andrew King]] became their manager.<ref>{{Harvnb|Schaffner|1991|p=17}}</ref>  Although the pair had little experience of the [[music industry]], they used inherited money to set up [[Blackhill Enterprises]], and purchased new instruments and equipment for the band, including a [[The Selmer Company|Selmer]] PA system.<ref name="Schaffnerpp3233">{{Harvnb|Schaffner|1991|pp=32<U+2013>33}}</ref>  Under their guidance, at venues including All Saints Hall and The Marquee, the band became part of London's [[underground music]] scene.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|pp=50<U+2013>51}}</ref>

While performing at the Countdown Club the band had experimented with long instrumental excursions, and they began to expand upon these with rudimentary but visually powerful light shows, projected by coloured slides and domestic lights.<ref>{{Harvnb|Schaffner|1991|p=34}}</ref><ref name="Masonpp4649">{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|pp=46<U+2013>49}}</ref>  To celebrate the launch of the [[London Free School]]'s magazine ''[[International Times]]'', they performed in front of a 2,000-strong crowd at the opening of [[The Roundhouse]], attended by celebrities including [[Alexander Trocchi]], [[Paul McCartney]], and [[Marianne Faithfull]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Schaffer|1991|pp=42<U+2013>43}}</ref>  Jenner and King's diverse array of social connections helped gain the band important coverage in ''[[The Financial Times]]'' and ''[[The Sunday Times]]''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|pp=52<U+2013>53}}</ref>

Their relationship with Blackhill Enterprises was strengthened when they became full partners, each holding an unprecedented one-sixth share,<ref name="Schaffnerpp3233"/> and by October&nbsp;1966 their set included more of their own material.<ref name="Masonpp4649"/>  They performed at venues such as the [[Commonwealth Institute#The Commonwealth Institute 1962.E2.80.932002|Commonwealth Institute]],<ref>{{Citation | title = Entertainments<U+2014>Classified Advertising | url = http://infotrac.galegroup.com/itw/infomark/532/365/36343438w16/purl=rc1_TTDA_0_CS67333169&dyn=7!zoom_3?sw_aep=mclib | publisher = ''[[The Times]]'' at infotrac.galegroup.com | date = 1967-01-17 | accessdate = 2009-08-27 | postscript = <!--none-->}}</ref> but were not universally popular; following a performance at a Catholic youth club the owner refused to pay, a stance which the magistrate agreed with, claiming that the band's performance "wasn't music".<ref>{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|p=54}}</ref>  This was not the only occasion on which they encountered such opinions, but they were better received at the [[UFO Club]] in London.<ref name="Masonpp5458">{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|pp=54<U+2013>58}}</ref>  Barrett's performances were reportedly exuberant, "<U+2026>&nbsp;leaping around and the madness, and the kind of improvisation he was doing&nbsp;<U+2026>&nbsp;he was inspired.

==== Signing with EMI ====
According to Mason, the psychedelic movement had "taken place around us<U+2014>not within us".<ref>{{Harvnb|Schaffner|1991|p=50}}</ref>  Nevertheless The Pink Floyd Sound were present at the head of a wave of interest in [[psychedelic music]], and began to attract the attention of the music industry.<ref name="Povey 2007 37">{{Harvnb|Povey|2007|p=37}}</ref>  While in negotiations with record companies, [[Joe Boyd]] and booking agent Bryan Morrison arranged for and funded the recording of several songs at Sound Techniques in [[West Hampstead]], including "[[Arnold Layne]]", and a version of "[[Interstellar Overdrive]]",<ref name="Povey 2007 37"/> and also for the production in Sussex of a short music film for "Arnold Layne".  Despite early interest from [[Polydor]], the band signed with [[EMI]], with a <U+00A3>5,000 advance.  Boyd was not included in the deal.<!-- Why is it important to mention that Boyd was not included in the deal? - because he'd done a lot of work with them, and got screwed over - band felt a bit sorry for him--><ref>{{Harvnb|Schaffner|1991|pp=54<U+2013>55}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|pp=59<U+2013>63}}</ref>

"Arnold Layne" became Pink Floyd's (the definite article seems to have been dropped at some point in 1967)<ref>{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|p=79}}</ref> first single, released on 11&nbsp;March 1967.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|pp=64<U+2013>66}}</ref>  Its references to [[cross-dressing]] saw it banned by several radio stations, but some creative manipulation at the shops which supplied sales figures to the music industry meant that it peaked in the UK charts at number&nbsp;20.<ref name="Masonpp8485">{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|pp=84<U+2013>85}}</ref>  All four members of the band had by then abandoned their studies or jobs, and they upgraded their ageing [[Bedford Vehicles|Bedford]] van to a [[Ford Transit]],<ref>{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|p=70}}</ref> using it to travel to over 200&nbsp;gigs in 1967 (a tenfold increase on the previous year).  They were joined by road manager [[Peter Wynne Willson]], with whom Barrett had previously shared a flat.<ref>{{Harvnb|Schaffner|1991|p=28}}</ref>  Willson updated the band's lighting rig, with some innovative ideas including the use of [[polariser]]s, mirrors, and stretched [[condom]]s.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|pp=78<U+2013>79}}</ref>

Their second release was "[[See Emily Play]]", on 16&nbsp;June.<ref name="Masonpp8687">{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|pp=86<U+2013>87}}</ref>  It was premi<U+00E8>red at the [[Queen Elizabeth Hall]] in London earlier in May that year,<ref>{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|p=88}}</ref> where the band also used a device called an [[Azimuth co-ordinator]].  They performed on the BBC's ''[[Look of the Week]]'', where an erudite and engaging Waters and Barrett faced rigorous questioning from [[Hans Keller]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|pp=86<U+2013>87}}</ref>  The single fared slightly better than "Arnold Layne", and after two weeks was at number&nbsp;17 in the charts.  It was mimed for the BBC's ''[[Top Of The Pops]]'', to which they returned after the single climbed to number five, but a scheduled third appearance was cancelled when Barrett refused to perform.<ref name="Masonpp8687"/>  It was about this time the rest of the band first noticed changes in Barrett's behaviour.<ref name="Masonp82">{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|p=82}}</ref>  By early 1967 he was regularly using [[lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]],<ref>{{Harvnb|Shaffner|1991|p=51}}</ref> and at an earlier show in [[Holland]] Mason observed him to be "completely distanced from everything going on, whether simply tripping or suffering from a more organic neural disturbance I still have no idea."<ref name="Masonp82"/>

==== ''The Piper at the Gates of Dawn'' ====
{{Main|The Piper at the Gates of Dawn}}
Pink Floyd's contract with EMI had been negotiated by their agent, [[Bryan Morrison]], and EMI producer [[Norman Smith (record producer)|Norman Smith]].  They were obliged<ref>{{Harvnb|Schaffner|1991|p=55}}</ref> to record their first album at EMI's [[Abbey Road Studios]] in London.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|p=87,&nbsp;p.&nbsp;70}}</ref>  There they experimented with [[musique concr<U+00E8>te]], and were at one point invited to watch [[The Beatles]] record "[[Lovely Rita]]".  Although in his 2005 autobiography Mason recalled that the sessions were relatively trouble-free, Smith disagreed, stating that Barrett was unresponsive to his suggestions and constructive criticism.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|pp=92<U+2013>93}}</ref>  ''[[The Piper at the Gates of Dawn]]'' was released in August 1967, and Pink Floyd continued to draw huge crowds at the UFO Club, but Barrett's deterioration was by then giving them serious concern.  The rest of the band initially hoped that his erratic behaviour would be a passing phase, but others, including Jenner and [[June Child]],{{#tag:ref|Child was employed by Peter Jenner as a secretary and general production assistant.<ref>{{Harvnb|Schaffner|1991|p=36}}</ref>|group="nb"}} were more realistic:

{{Quote|<U+2026>&nbsp;I found him in the dressing room and he was so&nbsp;<U+2026>&nbsp;gone.  Roger Waters and I got him on his feet, we got him out to the stage&nbsp;<U+2026>&nbsp;and of course the audience went spare because they loved him.  The band started to play and Syd just stood there.  He had his guitar around his neck and his arms just hanging down.|[[June Child]]|<ref>{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|p=95}}</ref>}}

To their consternation, the band were forced to cancel their appearance at the prestigious [[National Jazz and Blues Festival]], and informed the music press that Barrett was suffering from nervous exhaustion.  Jenner and Waters arranged for Barrett to see a psychiatrist, a meeting the frontman did not attend, and a stay in [[Formentera]] with [[Hank Wangford|Sam Hutt]], a doctor well-established in the underground music scene, led to no visible improvement.  A few dates in September were followed by the band's first tour of the United States.<ref name="Masonpp95105">{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|pp=95<U+2013>105}}</ref>  Blackhill's late application for work permits forced the band to cancel several dates,<ref>{{Harvnb|Povey|2007|p=69}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|p=94}}</ref> and Barrett's condition grew steadily worse.<ref>{{Harvnb|Schaffner|1991|pp=88<U+2013>90}}</ref>  He detuned his guitar during a performance at the [[Winterland Ballroom]], causing the strings to come off, and during a recording for ''[[Pat Boone|The Pat Boone Show]]'' he confounded the director by miming the song perfectly during the rehearsal, and then standing motionless during the take.  King quickly curtailed the band's US visit, sending them home on the next flight.<ref name="Schaffnerpp9192">{{Harvnb|Schaffner|1991|pp=91<U+2013>92}}</ref>

Shortly after their return from the US the band supported [[Jimi Hendrix]]'s tour of England,<ref name="Schaffnerpp9192"/> but Barrett's depression worsened the longer the tour continued,<ref>{{Harvnb|Schaffner|1991|p=94}}</ref> and his absence on one occasion forced the band to book [[David O'List]] as his replacement.<ref name="Masonpp95105"/>  Barrett's position as frontman was becoming less secure.  Wynne Willson left his role as lighting manager and allied himself with the guitarist.<ref>{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|p=102}}</ref>  Pink Floyd released "[[Apples and Oranges (song)|Apples and Oranges]]", but for the rest of the band Barrett's condition had reached a crisis point, and they responded by adding a new member to their line-up.<ref name="Masonpp95105"/>

====Gilmour replaces Barrett====

[[David Gilmour]] was already acquainted with Barrett, having in the early 1960s studied modern languages at Cambridge Tech, while the latter studied art.<ref name="Schaffnerpp2223"/>   The two had performed at lunchtimes together with guitars and harmonicas, and later hitch-hiked and busked their way around the south of France.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|p=28}}</ref> In 1965, while a member of [[Joker's Wild (band)|Joker's Wild]], Gilmour had watched The Tea Set,<ref>{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|p=34}}</ref> and two years later the band asked him to become the fifth member of Pink Floyd.  Barrett had recently suggested adding four new members, in the words of Roger Waters, "two freaks he'd met somewhere.  One of them played the banjo, the other the saxophone&nbsp;<U+2026>&nbsp;[and] a couple of chick singers".<ref>{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|p=110}}</ref>  While Barrett reluctantly agreed to Gilmour's induction, [[Steve O'Rourke]] (an assistant to Bryan Morrison) gave Gilmour a room at his house, and a salary of <U+00A3>30 per week.<ref name="Masonpp109111">{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|pp=109<U+2013>111}}</ref>  Gilmour immediately went out and bought a custom-made yellow [[Fender Stratocaster]], from a music shop in [[Cambridge]] (the instrument became one of Gilmour's favourite guitars throughout his career with Pink Floyd), and in January 1968 he was announced as the band's newest member.<ref name="Schaffnerp104">{{Harvnb|Schaffner|1991|p=104}}</ref>  To the general public he was then the second guitarist, but as Barrett's performances continued to ebb, privately the rest of the band began to see him as a replacement.  One of Gilmour's first duties was to pretend to play a guitar on an "Apples and Oranges" promotional film.<ref name="Schaffnerp104"/>

In a demonstration of his frustration at being effectively sidelined, Barrett tried to teach the band a new song, "[[List of unreleased Pink Floyd songs#Have You Got It, Yet?|Have You Got It Yet?]]", but changed the structure on each performance<U+2014>making it impossible for them to learn.  Matters came to a head on the way to a performance in [[Southampton]]. When somebody in the van asked if they should collect Barrett, the response was "No, fuck it, let's not bother".<ref>{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|p=111}}</ref>

Waters later admitted "He was our friend, but most of the time we now wanted to strangle him".<ref name="Blakep112">{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|p=112}}</ref>  For a short period Barrett still turned up to the occasional gig, apparently confused as to what was happening.<ref name="Blakep112"/>  As a result of his ''de facto'' removal, Pink Floyd's partnership with Peter Jenner and Andrew King was dissolved in March 1968, and Barrett's departure was officially announced on 6&nbsp;April.<ref>{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|pp=113<U+2013>114}}</ref>  Jenner and King, who believed that the creative spirit of Pink Floyd derived almost entirely from Barrett, decided to represent him, and ended their relationship with Pink Floyd.  Bryan Morrison then agreed that Steve O'Rourke should become Pink Floyd's manager.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|pp=112<U+2013>113}}</ref>  Barrett had been their main songwriter, and Gilmour mimed to his voice on the group's European television appearances, but while playing on the university circuit Waters and Wright created their own new material, such as "[[It Would Be So Nice]]", and "[[Careful With That Axe, Eugene]]".  They were joined by road manager Peter Watts before touring Europe in 1968.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|pp=115<U+2013>119}}</ref>

====''A Saucerful of Secrets''====
{{Main|A Saucerful of Secrets}}
For their second studio album, the band returned with Smith to Abbey Road Studios.  Several songs featuring Barrett had already been laid down, including "[[Jugband Blues]]" (his final contribution to their discography).  Waters contributed three songs, "[[Let There Be More Light]]", "[[Corporal Clegg]]", and "[[Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun]]" (which includes guitar work by Gilmour and Barrett), and Wright composed "[[See-Saw (song)|See-Saw]]" and "[[Remember a Day]]".  Encouraged by Smith, some of the new material was recorded at their homes, continuing the type of experimentation seen on ''The Piper at the Gates of Dawn''.  Smith remained unconvinced by their musical style, but when Mason struggled to perform on "Remember a Day", he stepped in as his replacement.<ref name="Blakepp116117">{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|pp=116<U+2013>117}}</ref>

{{Quote box |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=center |width=30em |quote = Norman gave up on the second album&nbsp;<U+2026>&nbsp;he was forever saying things like, 'You can't do twenty minutes of this ridiculous noise.'| source = Richard Wright<ref>{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|p=117}}</ref> | width = 33% | align = right}}

Neither Waters nor Mason could read music, so to create the album's title track, "[[A Saucerful of Secrets (song)|A Saucerful of Secrets]]", they invented their own system of notation; Gilmour later described this as looking "<U+2026>&nbsp;like an architectural diagram".<ref name="Blakep118">{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|p=118}}</ref>  ''[[A Saucerful of Secrets]]'' was released to mixed reviews in June that year; ''[[Record Mirror]]'' urged listeners to "forget it as background music to a party",<ref name="Blakep118"/> and [[John Peel]] claimed that the album was "<U+2026>&nbsp;like a religious experience&nbsp;<U+2026>".<ref name="Blakep118"/>  ''[[NME]]'', however, viewed the title track as "<U+2026>&nbsp;long and boring, and has little to warrant its monotonous direction".<ref name="Blakep118"/>  The album cover was designed by [[Storm Thorgerson]] and [[Aubrey Powell (designer)|Aubrey Powell]] of [[Hipgnosis]].{{#tag:ref|Storm Thorgerson attended the same school, about the same time as Waters and Barrett.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|p=19}}</ref>|group="nb"}}  Upon the album's release Pink Floyd performed at the first free [[List of concerts in Hyde Park|Hyde Park concert]] (organised by Blackhill Enterprises), alongside [[Roy Harper]] and [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]].  The band considered Morrison's assistant, Steve O'Rourke, as a "great deal-maker", whose business acumen overshadowed his lack of interest in aesthetic matters, and when Morrison sold his business to [[NEMS Enterprises]] O'Rourke became the band's personal manager.  This also enabled the band to take complete control of their artistic outlook.  They returned to the US for their first major tour, accompanied by [[Soft Machine]] and [[The Who]].<ref name="Masonpp127131">{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|pp=127<U+2013>131}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Schaffner|1991|p=122}}</ref>

Just before Christmas 1968 they released "[[Point Me At The Sky]]", which was no more successful than the two singles they had released since "See Emily Play", and which for several years remained the band's last single<ref name="Masonpp133135">{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|pp=133<U+2013>135}}</ref> ("Apples and Oranges" was not released in the US).<ref>{{Harvnb|Schaffner|1991|p=97}}</ref>  In 1969 they worked on the score for [[Barbet Schroeder]]'s ''[[More (film)|More]]''.  The soundtrack proved important; not only did it pay well, but along with ''A Saucerful of Secrets''<ref>{{Harvnb|Schaffner|1991|p=128}}</ref> the material they created became part of their live shows for some time thereafter.  A tour of the UK ended at the [[Royal Festival Hall]] in July 1969, during which an electric shock caused by poor earthing sent Gilmour flying across the stage.<ref name="Masonpp133135"/>  The performances, built around two long pieces called ''The Man and The Journey'',<ref>{{Harvnb|Schaffner|1991|p=131}}</ref> were backed with performance art created by artist Peter Dockley, and some of the sound effects were later used on 1970's "[[Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast]]".<ref name="Masonpp133135"/>

While composing the soundtrack for ''[[Zabriskie Point (film)|Zabriskie Point]]'' (directed by [[Michelangelo Antonioni]]) the band spent almost a month at a luxury hotel in [[Rome]].  Waters has since claimed that but for Antonioni's continuous changes to the music, the work could have been completed in less than a week.  Eventually he used only three of their recordings, in addition to material from the [[Grateful Dead]], [[The Youngbloods]], [[Patti Page]], and the [[Rolling Stones]].  One of the pieces turned down by Antonioni, called "The Violent Sequence", later became "[[Us and Them (song)|Us and Them]]", included on Pink Floyd's 1973 ''[[The Dark Side of the Moon]]''.  The band also worked on the soundtrack for a proposed cartoon series called ''[[Rollo (cartoon)|Rollo]]'', but a lack of funds meant that it was never produced.  Waters also scored the soundtrack to the 1970 film ''[[The Body (1970 film)|The Body]]'', with [[Ron Geesin]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Schaffner|1991|pp=136<U+2013>137}}</ref>

====''Ummagumma'' and ''Atom Heart Mother''====
{{Main|Ummagumma|Atom Heart Mother}}
''Ummagumma'' presented a departure from their previous work, containing barely any new compositions.  Released as a double-LP on EMI's [[Harvest Records|Harvest]] label, the first two sides contained live performances, recorded at Manchester College of Commerce and at Mother's Club in Birmingham.  The second LP contained a single experimental contribution from each band member.  ''Ummagumma'' was released to positive reviews, in October 1969.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|pp=135<U+2013>136}}</ref>

[[File:Roger waters leeds 1970.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Roger Waters]] performing with Pink Floyd, at [[Leeds University]] in 1970]]
''Ummagumma'' was quickly followed by 1970's ''[[Atom Heart Mother]]''.  The band's previous LPs were recorded using a [[Multitrack recording|four-track]] system, but ''Atom Heart Mother'' was their first eight-track album.<ref>{{Harvnb|Schaffner|1991|p=154}}</ref>  An early version was premi<U+00E8>red in France in January, but disagreements over its direction prompted the arrival of Ron Geesin.  Geesin worked for about a month to improve the score, but with little creative input from the band production was troublesome; it was eventually completed with the aid of John Aldiss.  Norman Smith was credited as an executive producer, and the album marked his final contribution to the band's discography.<ref>{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|p=148}}</ref>  Gilmour is generally dismissive of ''Atom Heart Mother'', once describing it as "a load of rubbish",<ref name="Schaffnerp144">{{Harvnb|Schaffner|1991|p=144}}</ref> although in 2001 he said it "was a good thing to have attempted, but I don't really think the attempt comes off that well".<ref>{{Citation | last = Cashmere | first = Paul | title = David Gilmour To Perform Atom Heart Mother Suite | url = http://www.undercover.com.au/News-Story.aspx?id=5095 | publisher = undercover.com.au | date = 2008-06-03 | accessdate = 2010-01-15 | postscript = <!--none-->}}</ref>  Waters was similarly critical, once claiming that he would not mind if it were "thrown into the dustbin and never listened to by anyone ever again."<ref name="Schaffnerp144"/>  ''Atom Heart Mother'' was hugely successful in the UK,<ref>{{Harvnb|Schaffner|1991|pp=140<U+2013>145}}</ref> and was premi<U+00E8>red at the Bath Festival on 27&nbsp;June 1970.<ref>{{Harvnb|Schaffner|1991|p=147}}</ref>

In 1971 they took second place in a poll of readers by ''Melody Maker'' (behind Emerson, Lake and Palmer), and for the first time were making a profit.  The theft in [[New Orleans]] of equipment worth about $40,000 almost crippled the band's finances, but although the local police were unhelpful, hours after the band notified the [[FBI]] the equipment was returned.  Mason and Wright became fathers and bought homes in London while Gilmour, still single, moved to a 19th-century farm in Essex.  Waters installed a home recording studio at his house in [[Islington]], in a converted tool-shed at the bottom of his garden.<ref>{{Harvnb|Schaffner|1991|pp=150<U+2013>151}}</ref>

There was no record company contact whatsoever, except when their label manager would show up now and again with a couple of bottles of wine and a couple of joints."<ref>{{Harvnb|Harris|2006|p=62}}</ref>  The band spent long periods working on simple sounds, or a particular guitar riff.  They also spent several days at Air Studios, attempting to create music using a variety of household objects, a project which would be revisited between ''The Dark Side of the Moon'' and ''[[Wish You Were Here (Pink Floyd album)|Wish You Were Here]]''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Harris|2006|pp=63<U+2013>64}}</ref>

''Meddle''{{'}}s production was spread over a considerable period of time; the band recorded in the first half of April, but in the latter half played at Doncaster and Norwich before returning to record at the end of the month.  In May they split their time between sessions at Abbey Road, and rehearsals and concerts across [[Great Britain]], and June and July were spent mainly performing at venues across Europe.  August was spent in the far east and Australia, and September in Europe.<ref name="Masonp157"/><ref>{{Harvnb|Povey|2007|pp=142<U+2013>144}}</ref>

''Meddle'' was released on 30&nbsp;October 1971 in the US, and 13&nbsp;November in the UK,{{#tag:ref|Povey (2007) suggests that the UK release date was 5 November,<ref>{{Harvnb|Povey|2007|p=150}}</ref> but Mabbett (1995) and Pink Floyd's official website both state 13&nbsp;November.

The group's other releases around this period, ''More'' and ''[[Zabriskie Point (album)|Zabriskie Point]]'', were soundtracks, and ''Atom Heart Mother'' was influenced as much by Ron Geesin and the session artists as it was by the band.<ref>{{Harvnb|Schaffner|1991|pp=152<U+2013>153}}</ref>  The band again worked with Barbet Schroeder on the film ''La Vall<U+00E9>e'', for which a soundtrack album was released, called ''[[Obscured by Clouds]]''.  The material was composed in about a week, at the [[Ch<U+00E2>teau d'H<U+00E9>rouville]] near Paris, and upon its release was their first to break into the top&nbsp;50 on the US Billboard chart.<ref>{{Harvnb|Schaffner|1991|pp=156<U+2013>157}}</ref>  At about the same time the band also produced the compilation album ''[[Relics (Pink Floyd album)|Relics]]''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|p=158}}</ref>

''The Dark Side of the Moon'' was released in March 1973, and became an instant chart success in Britain and throughout Western Europe.<ref name="Schaffnerp166"/>  Throughout March 1973 it featured as part of their US tour, including a midnight performance at Radio City Music Hall in New York City on 17 March.<ref>{{Harvnb|Harris|2006|p=157}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Schaffner|1991|pp=166<U+2013>167}}</ref>  The success of the album brought previously unknown wealth to all four members of the band; Richard Wright and Roger Waters bought large country houses, and Nick Mason became a collector of upmarket cars.<ref>{{Harvnb|Harris|2006|pp=164<U+2013>166}}</ref>  Much of the album's early stateside success has been attributed to the efforts of Pink Floyd's US record company, [[Capitol Records]].  Newly appointed chairman [[Bhaskar Menon]] reversed the relatively poor performance of the band's previous US releases, but, disenchanted with Capitol, the band and manager O'Rourke negotiated a new contract with [[Columbia Records]].  ''The Dark Side of the Moon'' was the last album that Pink Floyd were obliged to release before formally signing a new contract.<ref>{{Harvnb|Harris|2006|pp=158<U+2013>161}}</ref>  Menon's efforts to secure a contract renewal with Pink Floyd were in vain, and the band signed for Columbia with a reported advance fee of [[United States dollar|$]]1M (${{Formatnum:{{Inflation|US|1000000|1973|r=0}}}} today), while in Britain and Europe they continued to be represented by [[Harvest Records]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Schaffner|1991|p=173}}</ref>

{{Main|Animals (album)}}
[[File:Battersea Power Station in London.jpg|right|thumb|[[Battersea Power Station]] was the subject for the cover image for the band's 1977 album, ''[[Animals (album)|Animals]]''.]]
Following the Knebworth concert, the band bought a three-storey block of church halls at [[Britannia Row Studios|35 Britannia Row]] in Islington.  Their deal with EMI for unlimited studio time in return for a reduced percentage of sales had expired, and they set about converting the building into a recording studio and storage facility.  The studio would be on the ground floor, with the storage facility above, with a hoist to move the band's equipment in and out of the building.  The top floor became an office, equipped with a [[pool table]].  The band also envisaged hiring their equipment out, but the hire business was unsuccessful and would later be taken over by [[Brian Grant]] and Robbie Williams.<!-- NOT the pop star --><ref>{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|pp=215<U+2013>216}}</ref>  The studio was more successful.  Its construction took up most of 1975, and in 1976 the band recorded their eighth studio album, ''[[Animals (album)|Animals]]'', at the new facility.<ref name="Masonpp218220">{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|pp=218<U+2013>220}}</ref>

''Animals'' was born from another Waters concept, borrowed from [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Animal Farm]]'', where the human race was reduced to dogs, pigs, and sheep.<ref>{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|pp=241<U+2013>242}}</ref>  Brian Humphries was again called upon to engineer the album,<ref name="Masonpp218220"/>  which was completed in December 1976.  Hipgnosis took responsibility for the packaging, and offered three ideas, but unusually the final concept was designed by Waters.  For the subject of the cover image, he chose [[Battersea Power Station]], by then approaching the end of its useful life.  The band commissioned a {{convert|30|ft|m}} pig-shaped balloon (known as ''Algie''), and photography began on 2&nbsp;December, with a trained marksman ready to fire if the balloon escaped.  Inclement weather delayed filming, and O'Rourke had neglected to book the marksman for a second day.  ''Algie'' broke free of its moorings and ascended into the sky, eventually landing in [[Kent]] where it was recovered by a local farmer, reportedly furious that it had "apparently scared his cows."<ref name="Blakep246">{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|p=246}}</ref>  Shooting continued for a third day, but the image of the pig was later superimposed onto the cover photograph as the early photographs of the power station were considered to be better.<ref name="Blakep246"/><ref>{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|pp=223<U+2013>225}}</ref>

The division of royalties became a sore topic during production of the album.  Royalties were accorded on a per-song basis, and although Gilmour was largely responsible for "Dogs"<U+2014>which took up almost the entire first side of the album<U+2014>he received less than Waters, who also contributed the two-part "[[Pigs on the Wing]]", which contains references to Waters' romantic involvement with Carolyne Anne Christie.{{#tag:ref|Carolyne Anne Christie was married to [[Rock Scully]], manager of the Grateful Dead.

''Animals'' was released on 23&nbsp;January 1977,<ref name="Blakep246"/> and entered the UK charts at number two, and number three in the US.<ref name="Blakep247"/>  ''NME'' called the album "<U+2026>&nbsp;one of the most extreme, relentless, harrowing and downright iconoclastic hunks of music to have been made available this side of the sun&nbsp;<U+2026>",<ref name="Blakep247">{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|p=247}}</ref> and ''Melody Maker'''s Karl Dallas wrote "<U+2026>&nbsp;[an] uncomfortable taste of reality in a medium that has become in recent years, increasingly soporific&nbsp;<U+2026>"<ref name="Blakep247"/>  The album became the subject material for the band's ''[[In the Flesh Tour|In the Flesh]]'' tour, during which early signs of discord became apparent.  Waters began arriving at each venue alone, and departing immediately after the performance was complete, and Gilmour's wife Ginger did not get along with Waters' new girlfriend.  On one occasion, Wright flew back to England threatening to leave the band.  The size of the venues was also an issue,<ref>{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|pp=252<U+2013>253}}</ref> and the end of the tour was a low point for Gilmour, who felt that the band had by then achieved the success they sought, and that there was nothing else to look forward to.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|p=230}}</ref>

====''The Wall''====
{{Main|The Wall|Pink Floyd The Wall (film)}}
The ''In the Flesh'' tour was Pink Floyd's first playing in large stadiums, and at one venue a small group of noisy and excited fans in the front row of the audience irritated Waters so much that he spat at one of them.  Waters was not the only person who felt depressed about playing in such large venues, as that same night Gilmour refused to perform the band's usual twelve-bar blues encore.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|pp=235<U+2013>236}}</ref>  About this time, Gilmour and Wright released their d<U+00E9>but solo albums, ''[[David Gilmour (album)|David Gilmour]]'', and ''[[Wet Dream (album)|Wet Dream]]''.  Both albums sold poorly, a situation only exacerbated by the loss of much of the band's accumulated wealth.  In 1976, the band had become involved with financial advisers Norton Warburg Group (NWG).  NWG became the band's collecting agents and handled all financial planning, for an annual fee of about <U+00A3>300,000.  Between <U+00A3>1.6 million and <U+00A3>3.3 million of the band's money was invested in high-risk venture capital schemes, primarily to reduce the band's exposure to high UK taxes.  It soon became obvious that the band were still losing money.  Not only did NWG invest in failing businesses, they also left the band liable for tax bills as high as 83% of their income.  They eventually terminated their relationship with NWG, demanding the return of any cash not yet invested, which at that time amounted to <U+00A3>860,000 (they received <U+00A3>740,000).<ref name="Schaffnerpp206208">{{Harvnb|Schaffner|1991|pp=206<U+2013>208}}</ref>{{#tag:ref|Pink Floyd eventually sued NWG for <U+00A3>1M, accusing them of fraud and negligence.  NWG collapsed in 1981.  Andrew Warburg fled to Spain, Norton Warburg Investments (a part of NWG) was renamed to Waterbrook, and many of its holdings were sold at a huge loss.  Andrew Warburg was jailed for three years upon his return to the UK in 1987.<ref name="Schaffnerpp206208"/>|group="nb"}}

In the midst of this, in July 1977, Waters presented the band with two new ideas.  The first was a ninety-minute demo given the provisional title ''Bricks in the Wall'', and the other what would later become his first solo album, ''[[The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking]]''.  Although both Mason and Gilmour were initially cautious, the former (inspired by the recent spitting incident) was chosen to be their next album.<ref>{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|pp=258<U+2013>259}}</ref>  [[Bob Ezrin]] was brought in as co-producer, and he wrote a forty-page script for the new album.<ref>{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|p=260}}</ref>  The story was based on the central character of Pink<U+2014>a character inspired by Waters' childhood experiences<U+2014>the most notable of which was the death of his father in World War II.  This first 'brick in the wall' led to more problems, and Pink would become so drug-addled and worn down by the music industry that he would transform into a megalomaniac, a development inspired partly by the decline of [[Syd Barrett]].  At the end of the album, the increasingly fascist audience would watch as Pink 'tore down the wall', once again becoming a normal caring person.<ref>{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|pp=260<U+2013>261}}</ref>

{{Quote box |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=center |width=30em |quote = The rest of the band's children were young enough to stay with them in France but mine were older and had to go to school.

To record ''The Wall'', engineer Brian Humphries, emotionally drained by his five years with the band, was replaced by [[James Guthrie (record producer)|James Guthrie]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|p=238}}</ref>  In March 1979, however, the band's critical financial situation demanded that they leave the UK for a year or more, and recording was moved to the [[Super Bear Studios]] near [[Nice]].<ref name="Schaffnerp213">{{Harvnb|Schaffner|1991|p=213}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|pp=240<U+2013>242}}</ref>  The band were rarely in the studio together, but Waters' relationship with Wright broke down completely.  Wright was given a trial period as a producer, but his working methods and lack of creative input caused considerable tension.  Wright eventually stopped coming into the studio during the day, and worked only at nights.<ref name="Blakepp264267">{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|pp=264<U+2013>267}}</ref><ref name="Blakepp264267"/>  With a failing marriage and depression, he had his own problems, but matters came to a head when [[Columbia Records|Columbia]] offered the band a better deal in exchange for a Christmas release of the album.  Waters increased their workload accordingly, but Wright refused to cut short his family holiday in [[Rhodes]].<ref name="Blakepp264267"/>

What exactly happened next remains unclear. In ''Inside Out'' (2005), Mason says that Waters called O'Rourke, who was travelling to the US on the ''[[QE2]]'', and told him to have Wright out of the band by the time Waters arrived in LA to mix the album.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|p=246}}</ref> In ''Comfortably Numb'' (2008), however, the author states that Waters called O'Rourke and asked him to tell Wright about the new recording arrangements and that Wright's response was apparently "Tell Roger to fuck off&nbsp;<U+2026>".<ref name="Blakep267">{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|p=267}}</ref> Wright disagreed with this recollection, stating that the band had agreed to record only through the spring and early summer and that he had no idea they were so far behind schedule. Waters was stunned and felt that Wright was not doing enough to help complete the album.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|p=245}}</ref> Gilmour was on holiday in Dublin when he learned what was happening, and tried to calm the situation. He later spoke with Wright and gave him his support, but he reminded him about his lack of input on the album. Waters was insisting that Wright leave, or else he would refuse to release ''The Wall''. Several days later, worried about their financial situation and the failing interpersonal relationships within the band, Wright quit.<ref>{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|pp=267<U+2013>268}}</ref>

Rumours persisted that Wright had a cocaine addiction (something he always disputed), and although his name did not appear anywhere on the finished album,<ref>{{Harvnb|Schaffner|1991|p=219}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|p=269}}</ref> he was employed as a paid musician on the band's subsequent ''The Wall'' tour.<ref name="Blake285286">{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|pp=285<U+2013>286}}</ref>  Production of the album continued and by August 1979 the running order was largely complete.  Wright completed his duties, aided by session musicians.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|p=237}}</ref>  Toward the end of ''The Wall'' sessions, Mason left the final mix to Waters, Gilmour, Ezrin and Guthrie, and travelled to New York to record his d<U+00E9>but solo album, ''[[Nick Mason's Fictitious Sports]]''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|p=249}}</ref>

Their four [[Winnebago Industries|Winnebago]]s were parked in a circle, with the doors facing away from the centre.  Waters used his own vehicle to arrive at the venue, and stayed in separate hotels from the rest of the band.  Wright returned as a paid musician, and was the only 'member' of the band to profit from the venture, which lost about $600,000.<ref name="Blake285286"/>

The album also spawned a film.  The original plan was for the film to be a mixture of live concert footage and animated scenes.  However, the concert footage proved impractical to film.  [[Alan Parker]] agreed to direct, and took a different approach.  The animated sequences would remain, but scenes would be acted by professional actors, with no dialogue.  Waters was screen-tested but quickly discarded, and [[Bob Geldof]] was asked to take the role of Pink.  Geldof was initially disdainful, condemning ''The Wall'''s storyline as "bollocks".<ref>{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|p=289}}</ref> He was eventually won over by the prospect of being involved in a major film and receiving a large payment for his work.  Waters took a six-week holiday during filming and returned to find that Parker had used his creative licence to change parts of the film to his liking.  Waters was irate, the two fought, and Parker threatened to walk out.  Gilmour pleaded with Waters to reconsider his stance, reminding the bassist that he and the other band members were shareholders and directors and could out-vote him on such decisions.  A modified soundtrack was also created for some of the film's songs.<ref>{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|pp=288<U+2013>292}}</ref>  ''The Wall'' was released in July 1982.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|p=263}}</ref>

====''The Final Cut''====
{{Main|The Final Cut (album)}}
''Spare Bricks'' was to have been the soundtrack album for ''Pink Floyd The Wall'', but with the onset of the [[Falklands War]], Waters changed direction, and began writing new material.  Waters saw [[Margaret Thatcher]]'s response to the invasion of the islands as jingoistic and unnecessary, and he dedicated the new album<U+2014>provisionally titled ''Requiem for a Post-War Dream''<U+2014>to his dead father.  Immediately, there were arguments between Waters and Gilmour, who felt that the album should contain all new material, rather than songs not considered good enough for ''The Wall''.  Waters felt that, lately, Gilmour had contributed little to the band's lyrical repertoire.<ref>{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|pp=294<U+2013>295}}</ref>

{{listen | help = no | pos = left | filename = Pink floyd the final cut the post war dream.ogg | title = The Post War Dream | description = Waters' lyrics demonstrate his despair of war, in particular the Falklands Conflict | format = [[Ogg]]}}
Michael Kamen (a contributor to the orchestral sections of ''The Wall'') mediated between the two, and also performed the role traditionally occupied by the then absent Richard Wright.  James Guthrie was the studio engineer, and Mason was aided by two session drummers.  Recording took place in eight studios, including Gilmour's home studio at [[Outside Studios|Hookend Manor]] and Waters' home studio at [[East Sheen]].  The tension within the band grew.  Waters and Gilmour worked separately (itself not unusual) but Gilmour began to feel the strain, sometimes barely maintaining his composure.  Waters lost his temper, ranting at Kamen, who in boredom during one recording session, had started writing "I Must Not Fuck Sheep"<ref name="Blakepp296298">{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|pp=296<U+2013>298}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|p=268}}</ref> repeatedly on a notepad in the studio's control room.  After a final confrontation, Gilmour's name as producer was removed from the credit list, reflecting what Waters felt was his lack of song writing contributions.<ref name="Blakepp296298"/>  Mason's contributions were minimal, as he busied himself recording sound effects for an experimental new [[Holophonic]] system to be used on the album.  With marital problems of his own, he remained a distant figure.<ref name="Masonp273">{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|p=273}}</ref>

Hipgnosis had by this time disbanded, but again Thorgerson was passed over for the cover design, Waters choosing to design it himself.  His brother-in-law, Willie Christie, was commissioned to take pictures for the album.<ref name="Masonp273"/>  ''[[The Final Cut (album)|The Final Cut]]'' was released in March 1983, going straight to #1 in the UK, and #6 in the US.  "[[Not Now John]]" was released as a single, with its chorus of "Fuck all that" bowdlerised to "Stuff all that".  Despite its success, the album again received mixed reviews.  ''Melody Maker'' declared it to be "<U+2026>&nbsp;a milestone in the history of awfulness&nbsp;<U+2026>", but ''Rolling Stone'''s [[Kurt Loder]] viewed it as "<U+2026>&nbsp;essentially a Roger Waters solo album&nbsp;<U+2026>&nbsp;a superlative achievement on several levels&nbsp;<U+2026>"<ref>{{Citation | last = Loder | first = Kurt | title = Pink Floyd <U+2014> The Final Cut | url = http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/pinkfloyd/albums/album/107472/review/5943392/the_final_cut | publisher = rollingstone.com | date = 1983-04-14 | accessdate = 2009-09-04 | postscript = <!--none-->}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|pp=299<U+2013>300}}</ref>

===="Spent force"====
[[File:David gilmour brussels 1984.jpg|right|thumb|Gilmour performing in [[Brussels]] in 1984, on his ''[[About Face (album)|About Face]]'' tour]]
Gilmour recorded his second solo album ''[[About Face (album)|About Face]]'' in 1984, and used it to express his feelings about a range of topics, from the murder of musician [[John Lennon]], to his relationship with Waters.  He later stated that he also used the album to distance himself from Pink Floyd.  Soon after, Waters began touring his new solo album, ''[[The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking]]''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|pp=302<U+2013>309}}</ref>  Richard Wright meanwhile formed Zee with Dave Harris, and recorded ''[[Identity (Zee album)|Identity]]'', which went almost unnoticed upon its release.  Wright was also in the midst of a difficult divorce, and said later that it was "<U+2026>&nbsp;made at a time in my life when I was lost."<ref>{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|pp=309<U+2013>311}}</ref>  Mason released his second solo album ''[[Profiles]]'' in August 1985, which featured a contribution from Gilmour on "Lie for a Lie".<ref name="Blakepp311313">{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|pp=311<U+2013>313}}</ref>

Waters believed that Pink Floyd was a spent force, and contacted O'Rourke with a view to settling future royalty payments.  O'Rourke felt obliged to inform Mason and Gilmour, and as a result Waters tried to dismiss him.  Waters then went to the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] to prevent the Pink Floyd name from ever being used again.<ref name="Blakepp311313"/>  His lawyers discovered that the partnership had never been formally confirmed, and Waters returned to the High Court in an attempt to gain a veto over further use of the band's name.  Gilmour's team responded by issuing a carefully worded press release affirming that Pink Floyd would continue to exist.  However, Gilmour later told a ''[[Sunday Times]]'' reporter that "Roger is a dog in the manger and I'm going to fight him&nbsp;<U+2026>".<ref>{{Harvnb|Schaffner|1991|p=271}}</ref>

Waters wrote to EMI and Columbia and declared his intention to leave the group, and asked them to release him from his contractual obligations.  Gilmour believed that Waters left to hasten the demise of Pink Floyd, however, Waters later stated that by not making new albums, Pink Floyd would be in breach of contract<U+2014>which would mean that royalty payments would be suspended<U+2014>and that he was effectively forced from the band as the other members threatened to sue him.  With the case still pending, Waters dispensed with O'Rourke's services and employed Peter Rudge to manage his affairs.<ref name="Blakepp311313"/>  He went on to record for the soundtrack for ''[[When the Wind Blows (film)|When the Wind Blows]]'',<ref>{{Harvnb|Schaffner|1991|p=263}}</ref> as well as a second solo album, ''[[Radio K.A.O.S.]]''.<ref name="Schaffnerpp264266">{{Harvnb|Schaffner|1991|pp=264<U+2013>266}}</ref>

{{Main|A Momentary Lapse of Reason}}
[[File:Astoria (P<U+00E9>niche).jpg|right|thumb|''[[Astoria (recording studio)|Astoria]]'']]
''Radio K.A.O.S.'' was released in June 1987,<ref name="Schaffnerpp264266"/> just as Gilmour was recruiting musicians for what would become Pink Floyd's first album without Waters <U+2014>''[[A Momentary Lapse of Reason]]''.  Artists such as [[Jon Carin]] and [[Phil Manzanera]] worked on the album, and they were also joined by Bob Ezrin.<ref>{{Harvnb|Schaffner|1991|pp=267<U+2013>268}}</ref>  Gilmour was also contacted by Wright's new wife.  She had heard that he was working on new material and asked if Wright could contribute.  Gilmour considered the request; there were several legal obstacles to Wright's re-admittance to the band, but after a meeting in Hampstead he was brought back in.<ref>{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|pp=316<U+2013>317}}</ref>  Gilmour later admitted in an interview with author Karl Dallas that Wright's presence "would make us stronger legally and musically".  He was employed as a paid musician, on a weekly wage of $11,000.<ref name="Schaffnerp269">{{Harvnb|Schaffner|1991|p=269}}</ref><ref name="Manningp134">{{Harvnb|Manning|2006|p=134}}</ref>

The album was recorded along the [[River Thames]], on Gilmour's houseboat ''[[Astoria (recording studio)|Astoria]]''.  [[Andrew Jackson (recording engineer)|Andy Jackson]] (a colleague of Guthrie) was brought in as engineer.  Gilmour experimented with various songwriters such as [[Eric Stewart]] and [[Roger McGough]], but eventually settled on [[Anthony Moore]] as a lyricist.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|pp=284<U+2013>285}}</ref>  Gilmour would later admit that the new project was difficult without Waters' presence.<ref>{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|p=320}}</ref>  Nick Mason was concerned that he was too out of practice to perform on the album, and was replaced on occasion by session musicians.  He instead busied himself with the album's sound effects.  In a change from previous Floyd albums, ''A Momentary Lapse'' was recorded onto a 32-channel Mitsubishi digital recorder, and used [[MIDI]] synchronisation with the aid of an [[Apple Macintosh]] computer.<ref name="Schaffnerpp268269">{{Harvnb|Schaffner|1991|pp=268<U+2013>269}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|p=287}}</ref>

Waters on one occasion visited ''Astoria'' to see Ezrin, along with Christie, by then his wife.  As he was still a shareholder and director of Pink Floyd music, he was able to block any decisions made by his former bandmates.  Recording moved to [[Mayfair Studios|Mayfair and Audio International Studios]], and then to Los Angeles<U+2014>"It was fantastic because&nbsp;<U+2026>&nbsp;the lawyers couldn't call in the middle of recording unless they were calling in the middle of the night."<ref>{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|p=321}}</ref>  Waters tried to block a proposed Pink Floyd tour, by contacting every promoter in the US, threatening to sue if they used the Pink Floyd name.  Gilmour and Mason funded the startup costs (Mason, separated from his wife, used his [[Ferrari 250 GTO]] as collateral).  Some promoters were offended by Waters' threat, and several months later, tickets went on sale in [[Toronto]] (and were sold out within hours).<ref name="Blakep322">{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|p=322}}</ref>

[[Storm Thorgerson]], whose creative input was absent from ''The Wall'' and ''The Final Cut'', was employed to design the cover.<ref>{{Harvnb|Schaffner|1991|p=273}}</ref>  The album was released in September 1987, and in order to drive home the message that Waters had left the band, a group photograph was, for the first time since ''Meddle'', included on the inside of the cover.{{#tag:ref|Wright's name appears only on the credit list.|group="nb"}}  The album went straight to number three in the UK and US<U+2014>held from the top spot by [[Michael Jackson]]'s ''[[Bad (album)|Bad]]'', and [[Whitesnake]]'s ''[[Whitesnake (album)|1987]]''.  Although Gilmour initially viewed the album as a return to the band's best form, Wright would later disagree, stating "Roger's criticisms are fair.  It's not a band album at all."<ref>{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|p=327}}</ref>  ''Q Magazine'''s view was that the album was primarily a Gilmour solo effort.<ref>{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|pp=326<U+2013>327}}</ref>

Early rehearsals for the upcoming tour were chaotic, with Mason and Wright completely out of practice, and realising he'd taken on too much work Gilmour asked Bob Ezrin to take charge.  As the new band toured throughout North America, Waters' ''Radio K.A.O.S.'' tour was, on occasion, close by.  The bassist had forbidden any members of Pink Floyd from attending his concerts,{{#tag:ref|Mason (2005) goes some way toward backing this statement up, by stating that "rumour had it we would not be allowed in"<ref>{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|p=300}}</ref>|group="nb"}} which were generally in smaller venues than those housing his former band's performances.  Waters issued a writ for copyright fees for the band's use of the [[Pink Floyd pigs|flying pig]], and Pink Floyd responded by attaching a huge set of male genitalia to its underside to distinguish it from his design.  However, by November 1987 Waters appeared to admit defeat, and on 23&nbsp;December a legal settlement was finally reached.  Mason and Gilmour were allowed use of the Pink Floyd name in perpetuity, and Waters would be granted, amongst other things, ''The Wall''.  The bickering continued, however, with Waters issuing the occasional slight against his former friends, and Gilmour and Mason responding by making light of Waters claims that they would fail without him.<ref>{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|pp=329<U+2013>335}}</ref>  ''[[The Sun (newspaper)|The Sun]]'' printed a story about Waters, who it claimed had paid an artist to create 150&nbsp;toilet rolls with Gilmour's face on every sheet.  Waters later denied this story.<ref>{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|p=353}}</ref>

====''The Division Bell''====
{{Main|The Division Bell}}
For several years thereafter the three members of Pink Floyd busied themselves with personal pursuits, such as filming and competing in the [[Carrera Panamericana]] (where Gilmour and O'Rourke crashed), and later recording a soundtrack for the film.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|pp=311<U+2013>313}}</ref>  Gilmour divorced Ginger, and Mason married actress Annette Lynton.<ref>{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|p=352}}</ref>  In January 1993 the band began working on a new album.

Keen to avoid competing against other album releases (as had happened with ''A Momentary Lapse'') the band set a deadline of April 1994, at which point they would begin touring again.

===Post-breakup and Live 8 reunion (since 2005)===
{{See also|Live 8}}
[[File:Pink floyd live 8 london.jpg|right|thumb|[[Roger Waters]] (seen on the right) rejoined his former bandmates at [[Live 8]]]]

On Saturday 2&nbsp;July 2005 at the [[Live 8]] concert, the classic lineup of Pink Floyd performed together on stage<U+2014>for the first time in over 24&nbsp;years.<ref>{{Harvnb|Povey|1997|p=237}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|p=342}}</ref>  The reunion had been arranged by Live 8 organiser [[Bob Geldof]], who had called Mason earlier in the year to discuss the band reuniting for Live 8.  Geldof had already asked Gilmour, who had turned down the offer, and asked Mason to intercede on his behalf.  Mason declined, but contacted Waters, who was immediately enthusiastic.  Waters then called Geldof to discuss the event, which was at that time only a month away.  About two weeks later, Waters called Gilmour<U+2014>their first conversation for about two years<U+2014>and the next day the latter agreed.  Wright was contacted, and immediately agreed.  Statements were issued to the press which stressed the unimportance of the band's problems, compared to the context of the Live&nbsp;8 event.  The setlist was planned at the [[Connaught Hotel]] in London, followed by three days of rehearsals at [[Black Island Studios]].  The sessions were troublesome, with minor disagreements over the style and pace of the songs they were practising.  Waters wanted to use the occasion to expand the concepts he had designed, whereas Gilmour wanted to perform the songs in exactly the way the audience would expect.  The final setlist and running order was decided on the eve of the concert.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|pp=335<U+2013>339}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|pp=380<U+2013>384}}</ref> Gilmour and Waters shared lead vocals.  On stage, at the start of "Wish You Were Here," Waters told the audience: "It's actually quite emotional, standing up here with these three guys after all these years, standing to be counted with the rest of you.  Anyway, we're doing this for everyone who's not here, and particularly of course for Syd."  At the end of their performance Gilmour thanked the audience, and started to walk off the stage, but Waters called him back and the band shared a group hug that became one of the more notable images from Live 8.<ref>{{Citation | title = Live 8: London | publisher = live8live.com | date = 2005-07-02 | postscript = <!--none-->}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|p=386}}</ref>

In the week following their performance there was a revival of interest in Pink Floyd.  According to [[HMV]], in the week following sales of ''Echoes: The Best of Pink Floyd'' rose by 1343%, while [[Amazon.com]] reported a significant increase in sales of ''The Wall''.  Gilmour subsequently declared that he would donate his share of profits from this sales boom to charity, and urged other artists and [[Record industry|record companies]] profiting from Live 8 to do the same.<ref>{{Citation | title = Donate Live 8 profit says Gilmour  | date = 2005-07-05 | publisher = news.bbc.co.uk | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4651309.stm | accessdate=2008-11-15 | postscript = <!--none-->}}</ref>

David Gilmour released his third solo record, ''[[On an Island]]'', on 6&nbsp;March 2006<U+2014>his 60th birthday.  He began a tour of small concert venues in Europe, Canada and the US, with contributions from Wright and other musicians from the post-Waters Pink Floyd tours.  Mason joined Gilmour and Wright for the final night of the tour, and played on selected dates on Waters' [[Roger Waters - The Dark Side of the Moon Live (2006 tour)|2006 Europe/U.S. tour]].  Gilmour, Wright, and Mason's encore performances of "Wish You Were Here" and "Comfortably Numb" marked the first performance by Pink Floyd since Live 8.<ref>{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|pp=387<U+2013>389}}</ref>

== Live performances ==
{{Main|Pink Floyd live performances}}
Pink Floyd are regarded as pioneers in the [[Concert|live music]] experience, and were renowned for their lavish stage shows, in which the performers themselves were almost secondary. Pink Floyd also set high standards in sound quality, and made use of innovative sound effects and [[quadraphonic]] speaker systems.<ref>{{Citation |unused_data=This Day In Tech |url=http://www.wired.com/thisdayintech/2009/05/dayintech_0512/ |title=May 12, 1967: Pink Floyd Astounds With <U+2018>Sound in the Round<U+2019> |publisher=wired.com |accessdate=2009-11-23 |postscript=<!--none--> }}</ref> From their earliest days they were well known for their use of visual effects, which accompanied the [[psychedelic rock]] pieces performed at venues such as the [[UFO Club]] in London.<ref name="Masonpp5458"/>

The quality of their live performances, even when pre-recorded, was considered by the band to be extremely important; they boycotted the press release of ''The Dark Side of the Moon'' as they felt presenting the album through a poor-quality [[PA system]] was not good enough.<ref name="Schaffnerp166">{{Harvnb|Schaffner|1991|p=166}}</ref><ref name="Poveyp160">{{Harvnb|Povey|2007|p=160}}</ref>  The album had been composed and refined mostly while the band toured the UK, Japan, North America, and Europe.<ref>{{Harvnb|Povey|2007|pp=164<U+2013>173}}</ref>  ''Animals'' was the centrepiece for their ''[[In the Flesh Tour|In the Flesh]]'' tour, which began in [[Dortmund]], and continued through Europe to the UK, and then the US.  A inflatable floating pig named ''Algie'' became the inspiration for a number of pig themes used throughout the tour.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|pp=225<U+2013>226}}</ref>

Although Pink Floyd were experienced live performers, the behaviour of the audience on their ''In the Flesh'' tour, and the sizes of the venues they played, were a powerful influence on their concept album, ''[[The Wall]]''.  The subsequent ''[[The Wall Tour]]'' featured a {{convert|40|ft|m}} high wall, built from cardboard bricks, constructed between the band and the audience.  Animations were projected onto the wall, and gaps allowed the audience to view various scenes in the story.  Several characters from the story were realised as giant inflatables.<ref>{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|pp=280<U+2013>282}}</ref>  One of the more notable elements of the tour was the performance of "Comfortably Numb".  While Waters sang his opening verse, Gilmour waited in darkness, for his cue, on top of the wall.  When it came, bright blue and white lights would suddenly illuminate him.  Gilmour stood on a [[flight case]] on castors, a dangerous set-up supported from behind by a technician, both supported by a tall hydraulic platform.<ref>{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|pp=284<U+2013>285}}</ref>

Two years after the departure of Waters the band embarked on their [[A Momentary Lapse of Reason Tour]].  Starting in [[Ottawa]] on 9&nbsp;September they spent about two years touring the US, Japan, Europe, and Central Asia.  In [[Venice]], the band played to an audience of 200,000&nbsp;fans at the [[Piazza San Marco]].  The resulting storm of protest over the city's lack of toilet provision, first aid, and accommodation, resulted in the resignation of Mayor Antonio Casellati and his government.  At the end of the tour Pink Floyd released ''[[Delicate Sound of Thunder]]'',<ref>{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|p=307}}</ref> and in 1989 a concert video<U+2014>''[[Delicate Sound of Thunder (film)|Delicate Sound of Thunder]]''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Schaffner|1991|pp=281<U+2013>283}}</ref>

During the band's ''Division Bell'' tour, an unidentified person using the name [[Publius Enigma|Publius]] posted a message on an internet newsgroup, inviting fans to solve a riddle supposedly concealed in the new album.  The veracity of the user was demonstrated when white lights in front of the stage at the Pink Floyd concert in [[East Rutherford]] spelled out the words Enigma Publius.  During a televised concert at Earls Court in October 1994, the word enigma was projected in large letters on to the backdrop of the stage.  Mason later acknowledged that the [[Publius Enigma]] did exist, and that it had been instigated by the record company rather than the band. As of {{CURRENTYEAR}} the puzzle remains unsolved.<ref name="Blakepp363367"/>
