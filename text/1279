==Biography==
A 6'0", 215&nbsp;lbs. [[running back]] from the [[University of Georgia]] by way of [[Kashmere High School]] in [[Houston, Texas]], Rodney Hampton played his entire career with the Giants from 1990<U+2013>1997.<ref name="nfl.com"/><ref name="databasefootball.com">http://www.databasefootball.com/players/playerpage.htm?ilkid=HamptRod01 - Rodney Hampton Past Stats, Statistics, History, and Awards - databasefootball.com</ref> A two-time [[Pro Bowl]] selection in 1992 and 1993, his 6,897 career rushing yards stood as the most in Giants history until [[Tiki Barber]] surpassed that mark in the [[2004 NFL season]].  Hampton was a member of [[1990 New York Giants season|the Giants team]] that won [[Super Bowl XXV]].

After his [[rookie]] season was cut short due to injury, Hampton emerged as the team's most consistent offensive weapon over the next five seasons.  He broke the 1,000 yard mark each year from 1991<U+2013>1995.<ref name="nfl.com"/><ref name="databasefootball.com"/> Following the 1995 season, Hampton was signed to a free agent offer sheet by the [[San Francisco 49ers]], but the Giants quickly matched, and he remained in New York.<ref>http://www.sfgate.com/sports/article/49ers-Lose-the-Hampton-Auction-2991804.php</ref> Hampton rushed for over 800 yards in the 1996 season<ref>http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/H/HampRo00.htm</ref> sharing carries with [[Tyrone Wheatley]], but in 1997, Hampton underwent preseason arthroscopic surgery for a knee injury sustained in late in the 1996 season, and was only able to return to the team to see action in 2 late-season games, plus the Giants' lone playoff game.<ref name="bluenatic.blogspot.com">http://bluenatic.blogspot.com/2008/04/remembering-rodney.html</ref> The Giants released Hampton prior to the 1998 season, and though he announced his intention to continue playing and a couple of teams reportedly enquired with his agent, having received no offers once the season began, Hampton opted to retire.<ref name="bluenatic.blogspot.com"/>
