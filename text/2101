'''Porto Alegre''' ({{IPA-pt|<U+02C8>po<U+027E>tu a<U+02C8>l<U+025B><U+0261><U+027E>i|-|Br-PortoAlegre.ogg}}, ''Happy Harbour'') is the tenth most populous municipality in [[Brazil]], with 1,409,939 inhabitants, and the centre of Brazil's fourth largest metropolitan area (3,979,561 inhabitants). It is also the capital city of the southernmost [[Brazilian state]] of [[Rio Grande do Sul]]. The city is the southernmost capital city of a Brazilian state.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://iguide.travel/Porto_Alegre/Introduction |title=Location of Porto Alegre |publisher=Iguide.travel |date= |accessdate=2010-10-21}}</ref> Porto Alegre is one of top cultural, political and economic centers of Brazil. Two [[Mercosul]] countries, [[Argentina]] and [[Uruguay]], border on the State of Rio Grande do Sul.

Porto Alegre was founded in 1742 by [[Immigration to Brazil|immigrants]] from the [[Azores]], Portugal. In the late 19th century the city received many immigrants from other parts of the world, particularly [[Germany]], [[Italy]], and [[Poland]]. The vast majority of the population is of [[European Brazilian|European]] descent.

The city lies on the eastern bank of the Rio Guaiba (Guaiba Lake), where five rivers converge to form the [[Lagoa dos Patos]] (Lagoon of the Ducks), a giant freshwater [[lagoon]] navigable by even the largest of ships. This five-river junction has become an important alluvial port as well as a chief industrial and commercial center of Brazil.

The port of Porto Alegre is important for transporting local produce. The "[[Gaucho]] capital" has a broad-based economy that lays particular emphasis on agriculture and industry. Agricultural production includes produce such as [[plum]]s, [[peach]]es, [[rice]] and [[cassava]] grown on rural smallholdings. The [[shoe]] and [[leather]] industries are also important, especially in [[Novo Hamburgo]], in the Metropolitan Region of Porto Alegre.

Porto Alegre has a long coastline on the [[Gua<U+00ED>ba Lake]], and its topography is punctuated by 40 hills. In the lake, a vast body of water, a maze of islands facing the city creates an archipelago where a unique [[ecosystem]] gives shelter to abundant wildlife. The city area concentrates 28% of the [[Atlantic Forest|native flora]] of Rio Grande do Sul, with 9,288 species.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S0103-84782001000500020&lng=&nrm=iso&tlng= |title=Vegetation in the city |doi=10.1590/S0103-84782001000500020 |publisher=Scielo.br |date=1990-01-06 |accessdate=2010-10-21}}</ref> Among these, there are many trees which are the vestiges of the [[Atlantic Forest]]. Fauna are also diversified, specially in the islands and hills. The Portoalegrense environs include many parks, squares and wooded streets.

In recent years, Porto Alegre hosted the [[World Social Forum]], an initiative of several non-government organizations. The 9th Assembly of the [[World Council of Churches]] was held in Porto Alegre in 2006.

==The city==

[[File:Largo dos a<U+00E7>orianos 2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Azorean]]s Square.]]
The city is located on a [[River delta|delta]] resulting from the junction of five rivers, officially called [[Gua<U+00ED>ba Lake]] (popularly mentioned as a river too). Although its origins date from the mid-18th century, when immigrants from the Azores settled in the area, the city was officially established in 1742.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://recantodasletras.uol.com.br/mensagensdeaniversario/421892 |title=History of Porto Alegre |publisher=Recantodasletras.uol.com.br |date=2007-03-22 |accessdate=2010-10-21}}</ref> Porto Alegre is also one of the wealthiest cities in [[Latin America]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.portoalegre.rs.gov.br/infocidade/default.php?p_secao=30 |title=Porto Alegre's Rank |publisher=.portoalegre.rs.gov.br |date= |accessdate=2010-10-21}}</ref> and one of the most diverse. It has welcomed immigrants from all over the world, the largest numbers coming from [[Portuguese Brazilian|Portugal]], [[German Brazilian|Germany]], [[Italian Brazilian|Italy]], [[Spanish immigration to Brazil|Spain]] and [[Polish Brazilian|Poland]]. There are also significant [[Arab Brazilian|Arab]] and [[History of the Jews in Brazil|Jewish]] contingents in the population. The [[Afro-Brazilian]] population is also large in the city.

Before this, Porto Alegre was the port of [[Viam<U+00E3>o]] on the shore of Gua<U+00ED>ba Lake. Its ancient name was Porto dos Casais (Port of the Couples), and it was initially settled by [[Azores|Azorians]]. Many families of settlers also came from the city of [[Rio Grande, Rio Grande do Sul|Rio Grande]] in the littoral Lagunar region, to the south, a military fortress at that time. Today [[Rio Grande]] is the most important port of the State of Rio Grande do Sul. The city is also known as "Porto do Sol" (Port of the Sun) and "Cidade Sorriso" (Smile City).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.carnaval.com/brazil/portoalegre/#BU |title=Porto Alegre City - Names |publisher=Carnaval.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-21}}</ref> More than 70 [[neighborhood]]s (see below) are part of the city and two-thirds of the population are concentrated in the Zona Norte (Northern Zone), where most of the economic activity, including the city center, takes place.

Porto Alegre was the seat of the [[World Social Forum]] in 2001, 2002, 2003, 2005 and 2010. As the second largest city in southern Brazil, it is also an important industrial center in this geographical area. It is also a center for ''[[gaucho|ga<U+00FA>cho]]'' (the popular name for natives of the state) history and culture, famous for its ''[[churrasco]]'' (barbecue) and ''[[chimarr<U+00E3>o]]'' (a strong and hot tea prepared from [[yerba mate|erva mate]]). Important Brazilian universities, such as [[UFRGS]], [[UFCSPA]] and [[PUCRS]] are located there. In 2000, the [[literacy rate]] was 97%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.portoalegre.rs.gov.br/infocidade/default.php?p_secao=30 |title=Literacy rate of Porto Alegre |publisher=.portoalegre.rs.gov.br |date= |accessdate=2010-10-21}}</ref> The high [[quality of life]] is one of the city's main features. Here people will find an excellent urban infrastructure, telecommunications and excellent medical service.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reservas.net/alojamiento_hoteles/portoalegre_brazil.htm |title=Life - Porto Alegre |publisher=Reservas.net |date= |accessdate=2010-10-21}}</ref>

[[File:Cais Mau<U+00E1> Porto Alegre 2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Panorama of Downtown Porto Alegre]]
Porto Alegre is located in the [[subtropical]] zone and thus features a [[humid subtropical climate]]. Average precipitation is high and regular throughout the year. Summer temperatures often rise above {{convert|32|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F}} and high levels of humidity make the season very muggy. [[Subtropical climate]] is a climate zone characterized by hot, humid summers and chilly to mild winters. Significant amounts of precipitation occur in all seasons in most areas. Most summer rainfall occurs during thunderstorms and an occasional tropical storm, hurricane or [[cyclone]].

The winter is mild, windy, and quite changeable, which is also a feature of this time of the year. Usual winter temperatures range from {{convert|8|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F}} to {{convert|20|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F}}. [[Snow]] is very rare, sometimes confused with [[Ice pellets|sleet]]. The main snowfall events in Porto Alegre were in 1879, 1910, 1962, 1984, 2000 and 2006. Fall tends to be as changeable as winter, but are typically warmer. Spring, stabler akin to summer, is slightly drier than all the other seasons. Occurrence of [[radiation fog]] is common, causing several delays in early flights.

===Vegetation===
[[File:Morro da gl<U+00F3>ria3.jpg|thumb|left|Gl<U+00F3>ria Hill, a rural area of the city.]]
Porto Alegre lies in a transitional area between the [[subtropical]] [[forest]] and the Southern Brazilian grasslands (pampa). A number of conservation programmes have been established here to protect [[Endemism|native]] [[tree]]s. Many of the city's avenues have been planted with different tree [[species]]. One striking example of this is Teres<U+00F3>polis Avenue, where bottle trees have been planted. The city is covered in green vegetation and Lapacho and Jacaranda are the main species that can be found here. The trees from the hills are protected. Two environmental conservation areas can be found in this city: "Delta do Jacu<U+00ED>" (Jacu<U+00ED> Delta) State Park and Lami Biological Reserve.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reservas.net/alojamiento_hoteles/portoalegre_brazil.htm |title=Vegetation in Porto Alegre |publisher=Reservas.net |date= |accessdate=2010-10-21}}</ref>

The [[urban area]] has many parks and plazas, making Porto Alegre one of the greenest provincial capitals in Brazil. The first city squares date from the second half of the 18th century and were originally large public spaces used as food markets. The city has {{convert|39|km2|acre|abbr=on}} of green space, occupying 31 percent of the city's area. This is an average of 17.6&nbsp;m<U+00B2> per person. More than one million trees line the public streets and SMAM plants an average of 30,000 seedlings each year. The four main parks are: Parque Farroupilha, a {{convert|37|ha|acre|adj=on}} park; Jardim Bot<U+00E2>nico (The [[Botanical Garden of Porto Alegre]]), with some 725 species of vegetation on about {{convert|43|ha|acre}} of land; and Parque Marinha do Brasil (The Brazilian [[Navy]]'s [[Park]]), a vast park of more than {{convert|70|ha|acre}} which offers a wide variety of sports fields and tracks. The city's [[cycleway]] is called the Caminho dos Parques, which at over 5&nbsp;km (2&nbsp;mi) long links the Moinhos do Vento, Farroupilha and Gua<U+00ED>ba shore parks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sustainablecities.net/plusnetwork/plus-cities/porto-alegre-brazil |title=Green areas in Porto Alegre |publisher=Sustainablecities.net |date= |accessdate=2010-10-21}}</ref>

===Water===
[[File:Porto601737 89.jpg|thumb|400px|right|Sunset Sunset in Porto Alegre]]
[[Sanitary sewer|Sewer]] service is available to 84 percent of the city, and with 99.5 percent of the population serviced by [[Water treatment|treated]] water. While in most Brazilian cities the water is supplied by large state companies, in Porto Alegre the Municipal Department of Water and Sanitation Services, (DMAE) is the provider. It is the largest municipal water supplier in the country and enjoys operational autonomy and financial independence.[[File:Guaiba.JPG|thumb|left|Aerial view of Gua<U+00ED>ba Lake and Porto Alegre.]] As a separate entity from the municipal government it can make its own decisions on how to invest revenues it has collected, and such decisions are not directly subject to interference from the municipality. It receives no subsidies and makes no payments to the municipality itself. As a municipal undertaking, DMAE enjoys tax-exempt status, which allows it to keep water prices lower.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sustainablecities.net/plusnetwork/plus-cities/porto-alegre-brazil |title=Water system in Porto Alegre |publisher=Sustainablecities.net |date= |accessdate=2010-10-21}}</ref>

[[Inter-American Development Bank]] (IDB) approves US$ 83.2&nbsp;million to support the Integrated Socioenvironmental Program of Porto Alegre. The program will be carried out by the Municipal Department of Management and Strategic Support and will focus on: Improving [[water quality]] in Gua<U+00ED>ba Lake and the Cavalhada River; Developing urban infrastructure to reduce flood risk along the Cavalhada River; Improving the environmental management in the Municipality of Porto Alegre; and Promoting efficient municipal water, sanitation and storm drainage services. This program will improve the quality of life of the population of Porto Alegre by restoring water quality along the west side of Lake Gua<U+00ED>ba and directly benefitting more than 700,000 residents through expanded public sanitation services and urban environmental improvement.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zimbio.com/Water+Resources/articles/22/Improving+Environmental+Quality+Porto+Alegre |title=Integrated Socioenvironmental Program of Porto Alegre |publisher=Zimbio.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-21}}</ref>

===Air quality===
[[File:DSCN9616.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Panoramic view.]]
[[Motor vehicle]]s are responsible for up to 80 percent of the main atmospheric pollutant emissions. In the last 40&nbsp;years, the population of the city has doubled and the number of cars has multiplied 22 times, about one vehicle for every two inhabitants. The use of new buses along dedicated busways has decreased pollutants as there is less idling time. SMAM (the Municipal Council of the Environment) has encouraged the use of the cleanest fuels and has played a role in monitoring pollution levels.

A partnership between SMAM, the [[Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul]], the State Environmental Protection Foundation (FEPAM) and [[Petrobr<U+00E1>s]] has created a network of five air monitoring stations in Porto Alegre. By utilizing a Petrobr<U+00E1>s product called city diesel, [[sulphur]] levels in the air have dropped from 1.2 percent in 1989 to 0.5 percent. [[Hybrid bus]]es which run on both diesel and electricity are also being considered for the future. Because Porto Alegre has a ready supply of [[natural gas]], the city's taxi fleet is gradually being converted to it from gasoline.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sustainablecities.net/plusnetwork/plus-cities/porto-alegre-brazil |title=Air quality in the city |publisher=Sustainablecities.net |date= |accessdate=2010-10-21}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:Wendroth02.jpg|thumb|right|Porto Alegre in 1852.]]
Porto Alegre began as a large farm whose surroundings were inhabited by Indians from several different tribes. A small village formed in the area in 1752 by settlers mainly from the Azores, and in 1772 the parish of S<U+00E3>o Francisco do Porto dos Casais was formed. A year later the bishop changed the parish's name to Nossa Senhora Madre de Deus do Porto Alegre (Our Lady Mother of God of the Happy Port) and the city was selected as the location for the provincial government.

Porto Alegre had become a city of 12,000 inhabitants by 1822, the year the Brazil gained independence. The main port facilities were built between 1845 and 1860. By the end of the century the population had risen to 73,000. The city became known worldwide in 1963 through hosting the World University Games. In 1985 the people of Porto Alegre joined the movement for free elections and one of the largest demonstrations took place in the city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sustainablecities.net/plusnetwork/plus-cities/porto-alegre-brazil |title=History of Porto Alegre |publisher=Sustainablecities.net |date= |accessdate=2010-10-21}}</ref>

According to the IBGE of 2008, there were 4,026,000 people residing in the Metropolitan Region of Porto Alegre. The population density was {{convert|2905.3|PD/sqkm|PD/sqmi}} (in the urban area). The last PNAD (National Research for Sample of Domiciles) census revealed the following percentage: 3,218,000 [[White Brazilian|White]] people (79.94%), 477,000 [[Brown people#Pardos in Brazil|Brown]] ([[Multiracial#Brazil|Multiracial]]) people (11.84%), 300,000 [[Afro-Brazilian|Black]] people (7.45%), 19,000 [[Indigenous peoples in Brazil|Amerindian]] people (0.48%), 8,000 [[Asian Brazilian|Asian]] people (0.20%).<ref>{{cite book |url=http://www.sidra.ibge.gov.br/bda/tabela/listabl.z=pnad&o=3&i=P&c=262 |title=S<U+00ED>ntese de Indicadores Sociais 2008 |publisher=[[IBGE]] |location=Curitiba, Brazil |format=PDF |isbn=85-240-3919-1 |accessdate=2010-01-16 |year=2008 |language=Portuguese}}</ref>

Porto Alegre is mostly composed of Brazilians of European descent. Its [[colonization]] started in the mid-18th century, mostly with the arrival of [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] colonists from the Azores Islands. From 1748 to 1756, 2,300 Azoreans were sent to the region by the King of Portugal to protect [[Southern Brazil]] from neighboring invaders.<ref>{{cite web|author=Francisco Oliveira |url=http://www.riogrande.com.br/historia/colonizacao3.htm |title=Portuguese and Azorian Portuguese in Rio Grande do Sul |publisher=Riogrande.com.br |date=2005-08-01 |accessdate=2010-10-21}}</ref>

These colonists, mostly composed of married couples, established the city of ''Porto dos Casais'' (literally translated "harbor of the couples"), nowadays Porto Alegre. In 1775, 55% of Rio Grande do Sul's population was of Azorean [[Portuguese Brazilian|Portuguese]] origin.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atlasesportebrasil.org.br/textos/229.pdf |title=Azorean Portuguese origin in Porto Alegre |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-10-21}}</ref>

Porto Alegre was composed mainly of [[Portuguese people|Azoreans]] and their African [[slave]]s until the first half of the 19th century. The first non-Portuguese people to settle Rio Grande do Sul were [[German Brazilian|German]] immigrants. In 1824, the first immigrants from Germany arrived in Porto Alegre, but they were sent to what is now the city of [[S<U+00E3>o Leopoldo]] (28&nbsp;km (17&nbsp;mi) away). From 1824 to 1914, 50&nbsp;thousand Germans arrived in Rio Grande do Sul.<ref>{{cite web|author=Francisco Oliveira |url=http://www.riogrande.com.br/historia/colonizacao4c.htm |title=German colonies in the State of Rio Grande do Sul |publisher=Riogrande.com.br |date=2005-08-01 |accessdate=2010-10-21}}</ref>

Most of these colonists had rural communities in the interior of the State as their first destination. The large [[rural exodus]] in Brazil in the early 20th century brought many German-descendants to Porto Alegre and, nowadays, they compose a large percentage of the population.<ref>[http://www.brasilalemanha.com.br/informativo02.htm Germans from the interior of the state in Porto Alegre]{{dead link|date=October 2010}}</ref>

The second largest group of immigrants who arrived in Porto Alegre were the [[Italian Brazilian|Italians]]. They started immigrating to Brazil in 1875, mainly from the Northern Italian [[Veneto]] region.<ref>{{cite web|author=Francisco Oliveira |url=http://www.riogrande.com.br/historia/colonizacao5b.htm |title=Italian colonies in the State of Rio Grande do Sul |publisher=Riogrande.com.br |date=2005-08-01 |accessdate=2010-10-21}}</ref> As the Germans, Italians were also first sent to rural communities, mainly in the [[Serra Ga<U+00FA>cha]] region. After some decades, many of them started to migrate to other parts of Rio Grande do Sul, including Porto Alegre.

Minority communities of immigrants, such as [[Eastern Europe]]ans from [[Polish Brazilian|Poland]]<ref>[http://www.cekaw.org/historia_poloneses_porto_alegre.php Polish Brazilian in Porto Alegre]</ref> and [[Ukrainians of Brazil|Ukraine]]; [[Arab Brazilian|Arabs]] from [[Palestinian Brazilian|Palestine]], [[Lebanese Brazilian|Lebanon]] and [[Syrian Brazilian|Syria]]; [[Asian Brazilian|Asians]] from [[Japanese Brazilian|Japan]] and [[History of the Jews in Brazil|Jews]] also made Porto Alegre their home.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.portoalegre.rs.gov.br/imigracaojaponesa/default.php?p_secao=16 |title=Japanese Brazilian in Porto Alegre |publisher=.portoalegre.rs.gov.br |date= |accessdate=2010-10-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.terrabrasileira.net/folclore/regioes/7tipos/judeusul.html |title=Jew Brazilian in Porto Alegre |publisher=Terrabrasileira.net |date= |accessdate=2010-10-21}}</ref>

===Politics, government and citizenship===
[[File:Prefeitura velha de porto alegre.jpg|thumb|direita|Town Hall.]]
The executive branch is represented by the Municipality, its Departments and other public administration bodies directly and indirectly. In 2010 the mayor of Porto Alegre is Joseph Fortunati. The Legislature is represented by the City Council. The Legislature XV (2009/2012) is composed of 35 aldermen, as follows: PT June 6, the PMDB, PTB 5, 5 PDT, PPS 3, 3 PP, 2 of the PSDB, the PSOL 2, 1 the DEM, a PSB and one of the PRB. The Steering Committee is chaired by councilor in 2010 Nelcia Tessaro, the PTB. The judiciary is represented by the Central Court of the District of Porto Alegre. In 2010 the director of the Central Court is the judge Alberto Delgado Neto. 
One of the most striking features of public administration Porto Alegre is the adoption of a system of popular participation in the definition of public investment, called the Participatory Budget. According Fedozzi and Costa, this system has been recognized as a successful experience of interaction between people and the official administrative spheres in public administration and, as such, has gained a broad impact on the political scene nationally and internationally, being interpreted as a strategy for the establishment of an active citizenship in Brazil. The distribution of investment resources planning that follows a part of the statement of priorities for regional or thematic meetings, culminating with the approval of an investment plan that works and activities program broken down by investment sector, by region and around the city. Also according Fedozzi, this favors.
"the exercise of social control over government, hampering both goals for the personal use of private / public resources by those bodies as to the traditional exchange of favors (individual or collective), which characterizes the phenomenon of patronage ... and (triggers) a process of reversal of priorities in public investment, making the social groups historically excluded from urban development are recognized and integrated as active decision-making process of government management. The socioeconomic profile of participants, mostly constituted by layers of lower income and education level, and priority investments channeled to meet demand for sanitation and other infrastructure and services in the popular villages are quite revealing that aspect. "

But there are those who challenge the efficiency of the model, saying he was worn over the years and no longer causes debate or incite participation, or that its effects are not significant. Other social-political issues have been raised in recent times are of concern to minorities, such as Indians, blacks, homosexuals and others, by a progressive side have won respect, space and visibility, they still hoped to deepen the studies understanding of their realities, and public policies that meet their needs more satisfactorily, providing a more worthy inclusion, representative and active in local society. 
He excelled in recent years the completion of the first three editions of the World Social Forum in 2001, 2002 and 2003. The third edition attracted 20,763 delegates from 130 countries, with a total audience of 100,000 people from all parts of the world According to Oded Grajew, one of the mentors of the Forum, the initiative sought to denounce the risks of the neoliberal model. The events inspired the creation of similar movements in different countries, and many patrons of the WSF since its inception are now presidents of their countries and occupy important positions in government. The 10th edition of the WSF was also held in Porto Alegre, focusing their discussions on the reflection on the results achieved so far. The conclusions, however, been controversial. In the opposite direction, another important event is the Freedom Forum, held annually since 1988 and has the goal of finding alternative viable objective and solve problems for Brazilians, the defending liberal or neoliberal line.

==Participatory budgeting==

The first full [[participatory budgeting]] process was developed in the city starting in 1989. Participatory budgeting was part of a number of innovative reform programs to overcome severe inequality in living standards amongst city residents. One third of the city's residents lived in isolated slums at the city outskirts, lacking access to public amenities (water, sanitation, health care facilities, and schools).<ref name=autogenerated1>[http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTEMPOWERMENT/Resources/14657_Partic-Budg-Brazil-web.pdf Worldbank.org]</ref>

Participatory budgeting in Porto Alegre occurs annually, starting with a series of [[neighborhood]], regional, and citywide assemblies, where residents and elected budget delegates identify spending priorities and vote on which priorities to implement.<ref name=autogenerated2>{{cite web|last=Lewit |first=David |url=http://www.yesmagazine.org/article.asp?ID=562 |title=Porto Alegre's Budget Of, By, and For the People by David Lewit |publisher=Yesmagazine.org |date= |accessdate=2010-10-21}}</ref> Porto Alegre spends about 200&nbsp;million dollars per year on construction and [[service (economics)|service]]s, this money is subject to participatory budgeting. Annual spending on fixed expenses such as debt service and pensions, is not subject to public participation. Around fifty thousand [[Residency (domicile)|resident]]s of Porto Alegre now take part in the participatory budgeting process (compared to 1.5&nbsp;million city inhabitants), with the number of participants growing year on year since 1989. Participants are from diverse economic and political backgrounds.<ref name=autogenerated2 />
[[File:Edif<U+00ED>cio Uni<U+00E3>o.jpg|thumb|left|Union Building.]]
The participatory budgeting cycle starts in January and assemblies across the city to facilitate maximum participation and interaction. Each February there is instruction from city specialists in technical and systemic aspects of city budgeting. In March there are plenary assemblies in each of the city's 16 districts as well as assemblies dealing with such areas as transportation, health, education, sports, and economic development.

These large meetings, with participation that can reach over 1,000, elect delegates to represent specific neighborhoods. The mayor and staff attend to respond to citizen concerns. In the following month's delegates meet weekly or biweekly in each district to review technical project criteria and district needs.

City department staff may participate according to their area of expertise. At a second regional plenary, regional delegates prioritize the district's demands and elect 42 [[councillors]] representing all districts and thematic areas to serve on the Municipal Council of the Budget. The main function of the [[Municipal Council]] of the Budget is to reconcile the demands of each district with available resources, and to propose and approve an overall municipal budget. The resulting budget is binding, though the [[city council]] can suggest, but not require changes. Only the Mayor may veto the budget, or remand it back to the Municipal Council of the Budget (this has never happened).<ref name=autogenerated2 /> [[File:Centrodeportoalegre.jpg|thumb|Downtown Porto Alegre at night.]]
A [[World Bank]] paper suggests that participatory budgeting has led to direct [[improvement]]s in facilities in Porto Alegre. For example, [[sanitary sewer|sewer]] and water connections increased from 75% of households in 1988 to 98% in 1997. The number of schools quadrupled since 1986.<ref name=autogenerated1 />

The high number of participants, after more than a decade, suggests that participatory budgeting encourages increasing [[citizen]] involvement, according to the paper. Also, Porto Alegre's health and education budget increased from 13% (1985) to almost 40% (1996), and the share of the participatory budget in the total budget increased from 17% (1992) to 21% (1999).<ref name=autogenerated1 />

==Alternative programs==

About 98 percent of the Porto Alegre's residents are connected to the [[power grid]]. The vast majority of the city's [[Power (physics)|power]] comes from [[hydroelectric]] sources, at 94 percent of grid output. In Brazil, there are also a few coal-fired plants, fuel-oil fired plants and one nuclear facility. Increased utilization of [[natural gas]] and other sources is planned in order to reduce Brazil's overdependence on [[hydroelectric power]]. In 1999, a natural gas pipeline from [[Bolivia]] to Brazil was completed, with its terminus in Porto Alegre. Brazilian investment group Central Termoeletrica Sul (CTSul) has plans to invest US$698&nbsp;million in a 650MW coal-fired power generation plant in [[Cachoeira do Sul]], located in [[Rio Grande do Sul]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ceee.com.br/pportal/ceee/Component/Controller.aspx |title=State Company of Eletric Energy - Rio Grande do Sul |publisher=Ceee.com.br |date= |accessdate=2010-10-21}}</ref>

The largest wind [[energy]] [[park]] in Brazil, which is being built east of Porto Alegre in [[Os<U+00F3>rio]], will add 150&nbsp;megawatts (MW) to the Brazilian [[energy]] matrix. The production represents 5 percent of the energy consumed in the state of Rio Grande do Sul and would be sufficient to meet two-thirds of Porto Alegre's [[energy]] [[demand]]s. The Farm opened in 2008 with 75 2MW turbines and has been approved for a 300MW expansion which would make it the largest wind farm in the region. The project is part of the [[Alternative Energy]] Sources Program (Proinfa) from state-owned [[Eletrobr<U+00E1>s]], which will purchase the energy produced for the next 20&nbsp;years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sustainablecities.net/plusnetwork/plus-cities/porto-alegre-brazil |title=Energy in Porto Alegre |publisher=Sustainablecities.net |date= |accessdate=2010-10-21}}</ref>

===Recycling===
Porto Alegre was one of the first cities in Brazil to develop a recycling program and has been acknowledged as having the best management practices in the [[country]]. Since 1990, household waste already separated by residents has been collected in all [[neighbourhood]]s on a weekly basis. The city produces about 900 [[tonne]]s of household waste per day. Waste is sorted in [[recycling]] [[unit]]s, which are large sheds containing crates for the unsorted waste and benches for manual sorting. Once sorted, the waste is compressed and baled up to be sold as raw material to recycling factories. The units are managed by [[autonomous]] [[cooperative]]s with directors elected every two years. Organic waste is used to generate [[thermal energy]] and to make compost. Since 1997, all non-recyclable waste has been disposed of in landfill sites. Infiltration into the soil is prevented by the double-walled construction of a clay layer and a high-density polythene geo-membrane, the lowering of the water table and the draining off and [[Sewage treatment|treatment]] of any [[effluent]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sustainablecities.net/plusnetwork/plus-cities/porto-alegre-brazil |title=Recycling program in Porto Alegre |publisher=Sustainablecities.net |date= |accessdate=2010-10-21}}</ref>

===Fish===
The community of Bel<U+00E9>m Novo is benefiting from a municipal, citywide project to recover the [[Gua<U+00ED>ba Lake]] and its margins. Discussions with local fishermen led to the inclusion of a pier and two storage and cleaning facilities for the fishermen to use. The group also approved the creation of a multipurpose [[cooperative]], called ''"Coopeixe"'', to organize the fishing community. Fish is sold at markets, to restaurants and directly to consumers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sustainablecities.net/plusnetwork/plus-cities/porto-alegre-brazil |title=Fisheries Recovery Project |publisher=Sustainablecities.net |date= |accessdate=2010-10-21}}</ref>

==Nightlife==
[[File:Pepsionstage2.jpg|thumb|right|Pepsi On Stage.]]
Porto Alegre is well known in Brazil for its diverse nightlife. The city's clubs, pubs, bars and restaurants provide entertainment for a wide range of tastes and budgets, going from the cheap, traditional beer-'n-bite in a corner bar to all-night raves, and classy nightclubs. The nightlife here is similar to that of New York City, but on a micro-scale. In the "SoHo" area of Porto Alegre, there is a block full of great bars, restaurants and clubs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.world66.com/southamerica/brazil/portoalegre |title=Nightlife POA city |publisher=World66.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-21}}</ref>

Bars, some with live music and most with a predominantly young and trendy clientele, are spread out along, and just off, alongside the Parque Farroupilha and near the Federal University. Throughout the year, Porto Alegre's numerous Centros de Tradi<U+00E7><U+00E3>o Ga<U+00FA>cha organize traditional meals, music and [[dance]] [[performance]]s. Tourist offices have only limited information on the events, but full details are available from the Movimento Tradicionalista Ga<U+00FA>cho.

===Carnival/Carnaval===
{{Main|Brazilian Carnival}}
The Porto Alegre [[Carnival]] began in the 18th century with the entrudo, a prank brought over by the [[Portuguese Brazilian|Portuguese]] from the Azores, whereby people threw flour, water, and ''"lim<U+00E3>o de cheiro"'' missiles at each other. At the end of the 19th century, two important Carnival associations were born. Rivalry between the two long dominated the city's Carnival. The corso, a parade of floats down Porto Alegre's [[street]]s, was a [[Festival|celebration]] enjoyed by the more well-to-do of the city's inhabitants.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.museevirtuel.ca/Exhibitions/Festiva1/en/mpa/historia/entrudo.html |title=Carnival of Porto Alegre |publisher=Museevirtuel.ca |date=1999-04-19 |accessdate=2010-10-21}}</ref>

One of the most important Carnival [[personalities]] is [[King]] Momo. At the beginning of Carnival, usually in February, he receives the keys to the city from the [[Mayor]] of Porto Alegre, symbolically governing the Carnival during the four days of revelry. Vincente Rao was the most popular King Momo.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://virtualmuseum.ca/Exhibitions/Festiva1/en/mpa/historia/momo.html |title=King Momo - Carnival, Porto Alegre |publisher=Virtualmuseum.ca |date=1999-04-19 |accessdate=2010-10-21}}</ref>

===Cuisine===
{{Main|Cuisine of Brazil}}
One of the most famous foods of Brazil, [[churrasco]] (slow-grilled and -roasted meat), originated in [[Rio Grande do Sul]]. But cuisine is eclectic here, and rice and beans sit on southern tables beside [[Italian cuisine|Italian]] and [[Germany|German]] dishes, thanks to the South's many European immigrants. Colonial [[coffee]] is the elaborate 5&nbsp;PM tea, with breads, pies, and German kuchen, popular among the Germans in the South.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fodors.com/world/south-america/brazil/the-south/restaurants.html |title=Cuisine in Porto Alegre |publisher=Fodors.com |date=2010-10-01 |accessdate=2010-10-21}}</ref>

The traditional beverage is the "''erva mate''". The Chalet of the XV de Novembro Plaza is located along the Gl<U+00EA>nio Peres Square, it is one of the most traditional bar-draught beer-[[restaurant]]s in the city, where the last "''lambe-lambe''" photographs of the region work. "Lambe-lambes" are photographers who develop pictures outdoor using the oldest method known. In the [[Bavaria]]n style, with art nouveau traits, the centenary Chalet was built up on a demountable steel structure, keeping its original chandeliers and tiles even nowadays.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.carnaval.com/brazil/portoalegre/#BU |title=Drink in Porto Alegre |publisher=Carnaval.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-21}}</ref>

==Transportation==
===International Airport===
[[File:Salgado Filho06.jpg|thumb|right|[[Salgado Filho International Airport|Salgado Filho International Airport (POA)]].]]
[[Salgado Filho International Airport]] serves flights operated by major Brazilian airlines to many areas in Brazil and other South American countries. Salgado Filho International Airport also has an air cargo terminal, built in 1974, with 9,500&nbsp;thousand square meters of area and capacity to handle 1,500&nbsp;tons of export cargo and 900&nbsp;tons of imports each month. The average daily movement (arrivals and departures) is 174 aircraft, flying scheduled routes connecting Porto Alegre directly or indirectly to all the country's other major cities, as well as smaller cities in the interior of the [[Brazilian states|states]] of the [[Southern Brazil|South Region]] and [[S<U+00E3>o Paulo (state)|S<U+00E3>o Paulo]]. There are also international flights with direct connections to cities of the [[Southern Cone]].
[[File:Salgado Filho08.jpg|thumb|left|[[Airplane]] in the airport.]]

===Port===
{{Main|Port of Porto Alegre}}
[[File:Cais Mau<U+00E1> - armaz<U+00E9>ns e guindastes.jpg|thumb|right|[[Port of Porto Alegre]].]]
The Port of Porto Alegre is situated in the Eastern margin of Gua<U+00ED>ba Lake. The port lying on the eastern bank of the Gua<U+00ED>ba lake at the point where its waters empty into the huge Lagoa dos Patos is one of [[Brazil]]'s largest [[port]]. Located near the main access [[road]]s to Porto Alegre, is 4&nbsp;km (2.4&nbsp;mi) away from the [[Salgado Filho International Airport]] and has access to the [[railway]] [[Metro station|station]], through the docks of Mau<U+00E1> and Navegantes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.carnaval.com/brazil/portoalegre/#BU |title=Port of Porto Alegre |publisher=Carnaval.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-21}}</ref> Its geographical position enables a permanent traffic between Porto Alegre and [[Buenos Aires]], transporting steel-[[industry]] products and mainly agricultural produce.

===Metro===
{{Main|Porto Alegre Metro}}
[[File:TUE TRENSURB 113.JPG|thumb|left|[[Porto Alegre Metro|Metro]] in Porto Alegre.]]
The metro is operated jointly by the federal government, the state government of [[Rio Grande do Sul]] and the city of Porto Alegre through the company [[Trensurb]] (Company of Urban Trains of Porto Alegre) and has 17 [[Metro station|station]]s, totaling {{convert|42|km|mi}} of extension, carrying about 130,000 users a day. The Line 1 of the subway built in Porto Alegre was started in 1980, linking the center of Porto Alegre to cities to the north of the [[metropolitan area]], as [[Canoas]], Esteio, [[Sapucaia do Sul]], S<U+00E3>o Leopoldo and [[Novo Hamburgo]]. The choice of path was made to relieve the heavy traffic of highway BR-116, only option before the construction of this line, which already had serious problems with the transit at the time. The Line 1 was inaugurated on March 2, 1985 between the Central [[Public]] [[Market]] and Sapucaia do Sul. In December 1997 was extended to Unisinos. An extension of {{convert|2.4|mi|km}} [[S<U+00E3>o Leopoldo]]-[[Museum]] was added in November 2000, after two months of trial service.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clicrbs.com.br/zerohora/jsp/default.jsp?uf=1&local=1&section=Geral&newsID=a1642209.xml |title=Metro (Porto Alegre) |publisher=Clicrbs.com.br |date= |accessdate=2010-10-21}}</ref>
[[File:Trensurb.JPG|thumb|right|[[Porto Alegre Metro]].]]

===Highways===
[[File:Rodoviaria de Porto Alegre dentro.jpg|thumb|left|[[Bus station]].]]
There are only two [[highway]]s in the city, both running close to the northern and northwestern border of the city. This is so because there are no major destinations southeast or south of Porto Alegre (considering the landmass east of Lagoa dos Patos). One of them is BR-290, which runs east-west across the state, linking the northeast coast of the state to the [[Uruguay]]-[[Argentina]]-[[Brazil]] border. It runs close to the northern border of the municipality. The other one is BR-116, which runs northeast-south across the state, linking Porto Alegre to several satellite cities and other Brazilian capitals to the north, and [[Uruguay]] to the south. Within the municipality, it only touches the northwest side of the city, close to the end of Rio Gravata<U+00ED> (Gravata<U+00ED> [[River]]). The connection between downtown Porto Alegre and the aforementioned highways is made by Avenida Presidente Castelo Branco (President Castelo Branco Avenue), which is a rather short - {{convert|4|km|mi}} - avenue also bordering the northwest side of the city.

Since 1999, the largest [[road]] work ever, the Terceira Perimetral (Third Perimetral) has been under construction throughout the city. The Terceira Perimetral is 12&nbsp;km (7.4&nbsp;mi) long, connecting both north and south regions of the city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.carnaval.com/brazil/portoalegre/#BU |title=Road in Porto Alegre, RS |publisher=Carnaval.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-21}}</ref>

Another way to get to Porto Alegre from the north is using [[BR-101]] to Os<U+00F3>rio. BR-101 connects [[Curitiba]], [[Florian<U+00F3>polis]] and [[Os<U+00F3>rio]], and is currently being upgraded to highway standards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://iguide.travel/Porto_Alegre/Getting_There/By_car |title=BR-101 in Porto Alegre |publisher=Iguide.travel |date= |accessdate=2010-10-21}}</ref> Porto Alegre's [[Bus station]] is located downtown, and is served by several [[nation]]al and [[international]] lines (UNESUL, TTL, EGA, PLUMA, FLECHABUS, CHILEBUS). It is also connected to a Trensurb station ([[Porto Alegre Metro]]) and several municipal [[bus]] lines. Northbound passengers can rely on good bus connections throughout Brazil. However, an [[express bus service|express bus]] might be recommended if traveling to [[Uruguay]] or [[Argentina]] in order to avoid several stops while enroute.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.carnaval.com/brazil/portoalegre/#BU |title=Bus Station - Porto Alegre - Facts |publisher=Carnaval.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-21}}</ref>

===Bus===
[[File:0226.JPG|thumb|right|[[Bus]] in Porto Alegre.]]
This city has a nice transportation system, especially the [[autobus]]es. One of the bus companies is named [[Carris]], what is considered the best autobus company in Brazil. The city has also mini-buses from and to all the main [[neighborhood]]s in the city, very comfortable and just a few more boxes than the [[regular]] [[bus]], and in the mini-buses people will be always seated as it's forbidden to [[transport]] [[passenger]]s standing. ''Linha Tur<U+00ED>stica'' (Tourist Line) is a bus that leaves from Usina do Gas<U+00F4>metro tourist terminal around six times per day. During 90&nbsp;minutes, it traverses the various districts of Porto Alegre. For a modest price of R$ 5.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.virtualtourist.com/travel/South_America/Brazil/Estado_do_Rio_Grande_do_Sul/Porto_Alegre-1506259/Transportation-Porto_Alegre-BR-1.html |title=Bus in Porto Alegre |publisher=Virtualtourist.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-21}}</ref> The ''"lota<U+00E7><U+00E3>o"'' is an alternative [[system]], with fewer lines, smaller [[car]]s (up to 20 people), where one can hop on and off at any point (i.e. outside designated stops) of the trip. The fare is usually more expensive.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://iguide.travel/Porto_Alegre/Getting_Around/Lota%C3%A7%C3%A3o |title=Lota<U+00E7><U+00E3>o Transport in Porto Alegre |publisher=Iguide.travel |date= |accessdate=2010-10-21}}</ref> Exclusive [[bus]] [[lane]]s in the median of seven radial [[wikt:corridor|corridors]] that converge on the city center are used by both urban and [[regional]] lines. The bus fleet totals 1,600, with 150 [[minibus]]es. About 325&nbsp;million people use the [[system]] [[annually]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sustainablecities.net/plusnetwork/plus-cities/porto-alegre-brazil |title=Bus System in the city |publisher=Sustainablecities.net |date= |accessdate=2010-10-21}}</ref>

Those lines have no [[prefix]]. It is quite common to switch [[bus]]es at downtown but, considering there is a myriad of lines there, it can be challenging to find the right terminal to hop on the next bus. [[Transversal]] lines prefix "T" (T1, T2, ..., T11), connect different [[neighborhood]] without going through the downtown area, effectively eliminating the need of changing buses for the most common trips. [[Circular]] lines prefix "C" (C1, C2, C3), as the name indicates, run in a circular manner, usually connecting [[part]]s of the downtown area to the nearest neighborhoods.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://iguide.travel/Porto_Alegre/Getting_Around/Buses |title=Bus destines of the city |publisher=Iguide.travel |date= |accessdate=2010-10-21}}</ref> Mayor Jos<U+00E9> Foga<U+00E7>a renewed his agreement with EMBARQ and the Center for Sustainable Transport Brazil (CTS-Brasil) to improve [[accessibility]] and mobility in downtown Porto Alegre. The agreement, signed on March 11, includes a new partnership with the Andean Development Corporation, a Latin American multilateral financial institution that is expected to provide $1&nbsp;million in non-reimbursable technical assistance this year to help Porto Alegre complete the preparation phase of the ''"Portais da Cidade"'' [[bus]] [[rapid transit]] [[project]], a groundbreaking transport system designed to reduce pollution and congestion downtown. The system will include a [[south]]ern extension to accommodate activities for the 2014 FIFA World Cup. CAF's technical assistance will be administered through CTS-Brasil, which has been working to expand sustainable transport in Porto Alegre since 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.embarq.org/en/news/09/03/11/porto-alegre-revitalize-downtown-through-sustainable-transport |title=Bus Transport Project - Porto Alegre |publisher=Embarq.org |date=2009-03-11 |accessdate=2010-10-21}}</ref>

===Taxi===
[[File:Taxis Rodoviaria de Porto Alegre.jpg|thumb|left|Red taxis of Porto Alegre, 2002.]]
There are plenty of taxis. They can be pricey, if compared to other towns, but they are also an easier, safer and more dependable option than buses in some cases. To ride a [[cab]], one can walk to the nearest "taxi stop" (usually in crowded areas or [[Point of interest|points of interest]]), wave for an empty passing cab or call a tele-t<U+00E1>xi [[Service (economics)|service]]. Tele-t<U+00E1>xi may charge extra for this service.

The price of the fare is determined by a machine called tax<U+00ED>metro, usually in front of the passenger seat. There is always a minimum [[price]], which is shown when the machine is reset for the trip. Next to the value, there is a "[[flag]]" indicator that shows the level of price being paid, always according to the service. Usually there is a table inside of the cab explaining each level of service. It is recommended to check if the correct level is being charged in the beginning of the trip.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://iguide.travel/Porto_Alegre/Getting_Around/Taxis |title=Taxi in Porto Alegre |publisher=Iguide.travel |date= |accessdate=2010-10-21}}</ref>
