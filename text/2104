'''Zoological conspiracy theories involving Israel''' are occasionally found in the media or on the internet, typically in Muslim majority countries, alleging use of animals by [[Israel]] to attack civilians or to conduct [[espionage]]. These conspiracies are often reported as evidence of a [[Zionist]] or Israeli plot.

Examples include the [[2010 Sharm el-Sheikh shark attacks|December 2010 shark attacks in Egypt]] and the 2011 capture in [[Saudi Arabia]] of a [[Griffon Vulture]] carrying an Israeli-labeled [[GPS wildlife tracking|satellite tracking device]].

==Shark attacks==
[[File:Oceanic Whitetip Shark.png|thumb|An [[oceanic whitetip shark]], one of the two species implicated in the attacks]]

In December 2010, several shark attacks occurred off the South Sinai resort of [[Sharm el-Sheikh]] in Egypt.

Following the attacks, in an interview on [[Tawfik Okasha]]'s popular but controversial ''[[Egypt Today]]'' TV show, a Captain [[Mustafa Ismail]], introduced as "a famous diver", alleged that the [[GPS tracking unit|GPS tracking device]] found on one of the sharks was in fact a "guiding device" planted by Israeli agents.<ref name="ahram1">{{cite news |title=Expert shoots down conspiracy theory blaming Israel for shark attacks |author=Yasmine Fathi |url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/1343/Egypt/Politics-/Expert-shoots-down-conspiracy-theory-blaming-Israe.aspx |newspaper=[[Al Ahram]]|date=6 December 2010 |accessdate=30 December 2010}}</ref><ref name="Sky Mossad">{{cite web | url=http://blogs.news.sky.com/middleeastblog/Post:2c6bf5da-e006-4bab-84ee-c72a5845f2a8 | title=Mossad Behind Egyptian Shark Attacks? | publisher=Sky News | date=December 7, 2010 | accessdate=October 3, 2012 | author=Waghorn, Dominic}}</ref> Prompted in a TV interview for comments, the governor of [[South Sinai Governorate|South Sinai]], Mohammad Abdul Fadhil Shousha initially said: "What is being said about the Mossad throwing the deadly shark [in the sea] to hit tourism in Egypt is not out of the question.

Describing the conspiracy connection to Israel as "sad", Professor Mahmoud Hanafy, a marine biologist at [[Suez Canal University]], pointed out that GPS devices are used by marine biologists to track sharks, not to remote-control them.<ref name="ahram1"/><ref name="bbc2">{{cite news |title=Shark attacks not linked to Mossad says Israel |author=Yolande Knell |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-11937285 |newspaper=BBC News |date=7 December 2010 |accessdate=26 December 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Egypt to reopen beaches after deadly shark attack |author= |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2010/12/12/us-egypt-shark-idUSTRE6B84F820101212 |agency=Reuters |date=12 December 2010 |accessdate=26 December 2010}}</ref>  Egyptian officials suggested that the attacks were due to overfishing, illegal feeding, the dumping overboard of sheep carcasses, or unusually high water temperatures.

Amr Yossef, Adjunct Professor of Political Science at the [[American University in Cairo]], wrote that this and other similar conspiracy theories result from a misconception among the Egyptian public that Israel is all-powerful. Yossef wrote, "Notwithstanding that such allegations have no factual or logical grounds, no one stops to ask why should an Israel facing serious security challenges (Iran, Hamas, Hezbollah, etc.) busy itself with that kind of stuff".<ref>Amr Yossef (May 29, 2011) "[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/In+defense+of+reason,+not+Israel.-a0257565909 In defense of reason, not Israel.]" ''[[Daily News Egypt]]''</ref>

==Birds carrying Israeli tracking devices and tags==
Birds (as well as other animals) are often tagged with [[GPS wildlife tracking|GPS tracking devices]] or identification bands to record their movements for [[animal migration tracking]] and similar reasons.

Ohad Hatzofe, an avian ecologist for the [[Israel Nature and Parks Authority|Israel's Nature and Parks Authority]], said the idea that tagged birds are used for spying is absurd, and stated that "Birds and other wildlife belongs to all of us and we have to cooperate... Ignorance causes these stupid beliefs that they are used for spying".<ref name="sullivan">ARIEH O'SULLIVAN /The Media Line. "White bird down leads to delicate rescue operation. Some see a spy in every GPS-carrying pelican, but Israel gives no credence to 'stupid belief'." The Jerusalem Post. 2011.</ref>

=== Griffon vulture ===
[[File:Gyps fulvus -Oakland Zoo-8a.jpg|thumb|right|A [[griffon vulture]] similar to the one captured in 2011.]]
The [[Griffon Vulture]] has been nearly extinct from the mountains of Israel and is the subject of a [[reintroduction]] project. As part of that project, vultures are tracked to keep track of the population.

In 2011, a griffon vulture with a wingspan of about {{convert|8|ft|m}} was caught by a hunter near [[Ha'il]], [[Saudi Arabia]] wearing a GPS device and a "[[Tel Aviv University]]" leg tag. Rumors spread among locals, repeated in some Saudi newspapers, that the bird was sent by Israel to spy on the country.<ref name=star/><ref name=haaretz/><ref name=BBC/><ref name=lahona/>

Prince [[Bandar bin Sultan]], then Secretary General of the [[Saudi National Security Council]] dismissed the rumors, said the equipment on the bird was simply there for scientific study, and that the bird would be quickly released. Saudi wildlife authorities agreed that the equipment was for solely scientific purposes. "Some Saudi journalists rushed in carrying the news of this bird for the sake of getting a scoop without checking the information... they should have asked the competent authorities about the bird before publishing such news," Bandar said at the time.<ref name=Emirates>{{cite news|title=Saudis to free Israeli vulture |publisher=[[Emirates 24/7]]|author= Emirates 24/7 staff|url =http://www.emirates247.com/news/region/saudis-to-free-israeli-vulture-2011-01-09-1.339781|date=9 January 2011}}</ref> Israeli officials described the rumor as "ludicrous" and said they were "stunned."<ref name=BBC/>

A spokesman for Israel's Park and Nature Authority told the Israeli daily ''[[Ma'ariv]]'' that Israeli scientists use GPS devices to track [[Bird migration|migration]] routes. "The device does nothing more than receive and store basic data about the bird's whereabouts," he said.<ref name=BBC/><ref name=ABC>{{cite news|title=Israeli Vulture Spy Declared Innocent By Saudi Arabia |publisher=[[ABC News]]|author= Alexander Marquardt|url =http://abcnews.go.com/International/saudi-prince-clears-israeli-vulture-spy/story?id=12584216|date=10 January 2011}}</ref> The Israeli ornithologist Yossi Leshem of Tel Aviv University said that this was the third such detention of a bird tracked by Israeli scientists in 3 decades. He reported that Sudanese authorities detained an [[Egyptian Vulture]] in the late 1970s, and a [[Great White Pelican|White Pelican]] in the early 1980s, both carrying Israeli equipment used for [[animal migration tracking]].<ref name="news.sciencemag.org"/><ref name="news.sciencemag.org">[http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2011/01/vulture-saudis-nabbed-was-third.html Vulture Saudis Nabbed Was Third Israeli Bird Held Since 1975]</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Diehl |first=Jackson |url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/postpartisan/2011/01/israels_spying_vulture--and_ki.html |title=PostPartisan - Israel's Spying Vulture - and Killer Shark |publisher=Voices.washingtonpost.com |date= |accessdate=3 October 2012}}</ref>

=== Bee-eater ===
[[File:Merops apiaster - Tiergarten Sch<U+00F6>nbrunn 5.jpg|thumb|right|A living European Bee-eater.]]
In May 2012, a dead [[European Bee-eater]] with an Israeli leg-band, used by naturalists to track migratory birds, was found by villagers near the south-eastern Turkish city of [[Gaziantep]]. The villagers worried that the bird may have carried a micro-chip from Israeli intelligence to spy on the area and alerted local officials. At one point, a counter-terrorism unit became involved. Turkey's agriculture ministry examined the corpse of the bee-eater and assured villagers that it is common to equip migratory birds with rings in order to track their movements. The BBC correspondent, Jonathan Head, ascribed the event to his view that "wildly implausible conspiracy theories take root easily in Turkey, with alleged Israeli plots among the most widely believed."<ref name="BBC Turkey villagers">{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-18092775 | title=Turkey villagers see Israeli spy in migratory bird | publisher=BBC | date=16 May 2012 | accessdate=October 3, 2012}}</ref>

=== Vulture ===
In December 2012, a [[Sudan]]ese newspaper reported that the Sudan government had captured a vulture, in the town of Kereinek, which they said was an Israeli spy bird and was tagged in Hebrew and equipped with electronic devices.<ref>[http://www.sudanjem.com/2012/12/%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AE%D8%B1%D8%B7%D9%88%D9%85-%D8%AA%D8%B1%D8%B5%D8%AF-%D8%B7%D9%8A%D9%88%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AA%D8%AC%D8%B3%D8%B3-%D9%88%D8%AA%D8%B9%D8%AC/ Arabic: Khartoum radar monitors bird for espionage but unable to monitor aircraft]</ref><ref>[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/israel/9734674/Vulture-spying-for-Israel-caught-in-Sudan.html 'Vulture spying for Israel' caught in Sudan]</ref>

Ohad Hazofe, an ecologist from the [[Israel Nature and Parks Authority]] to and Israeli news site [[YNet]]: "This is a young vulture that was tagged, along with 100 others, in October. He has two wing bands and a German-made GPS chip,". Ohad Hazofe denied that the device had any photographic capabilities.<ref>http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/israeli-spy-captured-sudan/story?id=17926788#.UMb0pFFLdBo</ref>

== Commentary on patterns ==
[[File:Mossad seal.svg|thumb|right|The [[Mossad]] is the national intelligence agency of Israel. According to James Hider, evidence of Mossad using spy animals is scant.]]
Writing in ''[[The Times]]'', [[James Hider]] linked the responses to the shark incident with those to the vulture incident and ascribed the reactions in Arab countries to "paranoia among Israel's enemies and its nominal friends", adding that "evidence of Mossad using animals is scant."<ref name=australian>{{cite news|title=Vulture held as Mossad spy by Saudi Arabia
|publisher=[[The Australian]]|author= James Hider|url =http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/vulture-held-as-mossad-spy-by-saudi-arabia/story-e6frg6so-1225983216550|date=7 January 2011}}</ref>

[[Jackson Diehl]] of the ''[[Washington Post]]'' also linked the two events, writing that Arab media and officials who circulate fantasies of Mossad sharks and spy birds "deserve to be mocked". While mentioning [[Bret Stephens]]' theory, that the conspiracy theories are an example of "the debasement of the Arab mind", Diehl wrote that the paranoia in fact has also a more benign explanation, since Israel's real covert operations "are almost as fantastic as the fantasies".<ref name=WP/>

In 2011, Jihad el Khazen of the Lebanese newspaper ''[[Al Hayat|Dar Al Hayat]]'' published a column analyzing recent animal related conspiracy theories, explaining that the concept of conspiracy is not particular to Arabs. According to Dar Al Hayat, people "always look for explanations that suit their prejudices or whims, even as such explanations often give truth, logic and reason a slap in the face".<ref>Jihad el Khazen (Jan 27, 2011) "[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Ayoon+Wa+Azan+%28Conspiracy+Theory%29.-a0247801985 Ayoon Wa Azan (Conspiracy Theory).]" Dar Al Hayat, International ed. (Beirut, Lebanon). Al Bawaba (Middle East) Ltd.</ref>

[[Gil Yaron]] wrote in the ''[[The Toronto Star]]'' that "Many animals undoubtedly serve in Israel<U+2019>s army and security services: dogs sniff out bombs and alpaca help mountaineers carry their loads. [...] But tales about the use of sharks, birds, rodents or, as has also been claimed, insects in the service of the military are more the fruit of imagination than hard fact."<ref name=star/>
