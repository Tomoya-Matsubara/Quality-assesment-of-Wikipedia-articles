'''Joan of Arc'''<ref>Her name was written in a variety of ways, particularly prior to the mid-19th century. See Pernoud and Clin, pp. 220<U+2013>221. She reportedly signed her name as "Jehanne" (see [http://www.stjoan-center.com/Album/part47.html www.stjoan-center.com/Album/, parts 47] and [http://www.stjoan-center.com/Album/part49.html 49]; it is also noted in Pernoud and Clin).</ref> (c. 1412<ref name=longwinded/> &ndash; 30 May 1431) also known as "the Maid of Orleans," was a 15th century [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] [[saint]], and national [[hero]]ine of [[France]]. A peasant girl born in Eastern France, Joan led the French army to several important victories during the [[Hundred Years' War]], claiming divine guidance, and was indirectly responsible for the coronation of King [[Charles VII of France|Charles VII]].  She was captured by the English, tried by an [[Ecclesiology|ecclesiastical]] court and burned at the stake when she was nineteen years old. Twenty-four years later, the [[Holy See]] reviewed the decision of the ecclesiastical court, found her innocent, and declared her a [[martyr]]. She was [[beatified]] in 1909 and later [[canonized]] in 1920.<ref name="longwinded">Modern biographical summaries often assert a birthdate of 6 January for Joan. In fact, however, she could only estimate her own age. All of the rehabilitation-trial witnesses likewise estimated her age even though several of these people were her godmothers and godfathers. The 6 January claim is based on a single source: a letter from Lord Perceval de Boullainvilliers on 21 July 1429 (see Pernoud's ''Joan of Arc By Herself and Her Witnesses'', p. 98: "Boulainvilliers tells of her birth in Domr<U+00E9>my, and it is he who gives us an exact date, which may be the true one, saying that she was born on the night of Epiphany, 6 January"). Boulainvilliers, however, was not from Domr<U+00E9>my. The event was probably not recorded. The practice of [[parish register]]s for non-noble births did not begin until several generations later.</ref>

Joan asserted that she had visions from [[God]] that told her to recover her homeland from [[England|English]] domination late in the [[Hundred Years' War]]. The uncrowned [[Charles VII of France|King Charles VII]] sent her to the [[Siege of Orl<U+00E9>ans|siege at Orl<U+00E9>ans]] as part of a relief mission. She gained prominence when she overcame the dismissive attitude of veteran commanders and lifted the siege in only nine days. Several more swift victories led to Charles VII's coronation at [[Reims]] and settled the disputed succession to the throne.

Joan of Arc has remained an important figure throughout Western culture. From [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] to the present, French politicians of all leanings have invoked her memory. Major writers and composers who have created works about her include [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], [[Voltaire]], [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller]], [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]], [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]], [[Mark Twain|Twain]], and [[George Bernard Shaw|Shaw]].  [[Cultural depictions of Joan of Arc|Depictions of her]] continue in film, television, video games, song, and dance.

== Background ==
The historian [[Kelly DeVries]] describes the period preceding her appearance with, "If anything could have discouraged her, the state of France in 1429 should have." The [[Hundred Years' War]] had begun in 1337 as a [[English claims to the French throne|succession dispute to the French throne]] with intermittent periods of relative peace. Nearly all the fighting had taken place in France, and the English use of ''[[chevauch<U+00E9>e]]'' tactics had devastated the economy. The [[Medieval demography|French population]] had not recovered from the [[Black Death]] of the previous century and its merchants were cut off from foreign markets. At the outset of her career, the English had almost achieved their goal of a dual monarchy under English control and the French army had won no major victory for a generation. In DeVries's words, "the kingdom of France was not even a shadow of its thirteenth-century prototype."<ref>DeVries, pp. 27<U+2013>28.</ref>
 
The French king at the time of Joan's birth, [[Charles VI of France|Charles VI]], suffered bouts of insanity and was often unable to rule. The king's brother Duke [[Louis of Valois, Duke of Orl<U+00E9>ans|Louis]] of Orl<U+00E9>ans and the king's cousin [[John the Fearless]], [[Duke of Burgundy]], quarreled over the regency of France and the guardianship of the royal children. This dispute escalated to accusations of an extramarital affair with Queen [[Isabeau of Bavaria]] and the kidnappings of the royal children. The matter climaxed when the Duke of Burgundy ordered the assassination of the Duke of Orl<U+00E9>ans in 1407.

The factions loyal to these two men became known as the [[Armagnac (party)|Armagnacs]] and the [[Burgundian (party)|Burgundians]]. The English king, [[Henry V of England|Henry V]], took advantage of this turmoil to invade France, winning a dramatic [[Battle of Agincourt|victory at Agincourt]] in 1415, and capturing northern French towns.<ref>DeVries, pp. 15&ndash;19.</ref> The future French king, [[Charles VII of France|Charles VII]], assumed the title of [[Dauphin of France|Dauphin]] as heir to the throne at the age of 14, after all four of his older brothers died.<ref>Pernoud and Clin, p. 167.</ref> His first significant official act was to conclude a peace treaty with Burgundy in 1419. This ended in disaster when Armagnac partisans murdered John the Fearless during a meeting under Charles's guarantee of protection. The new Duke of Burgundy, [[Philip III, Duke of Burgundy|Philip the Good]], blamed Charles and entered into an alliance with the English. Large sections of France were conquered.<ref>DeVries, p. 24.</ref>

In 1420, Queen Isabeau of Bavaria concluded the [[Treaty of Troyes]], which granted the French royal succession to Henry V and his heirs in preference to her son Charles. This agreement revived rumors about her supposed affair with the late duke of Orl<U+00E9>ans and raised fresh suspicions that the Dauphin was a royal bastard rather than the son of the king.<ref>Pernoud and Clin, pp. 188&ndash;189.</ref> Henry V and Charles VI died within two months of each other in 1422, leaving an infant, [[Henry VI of England]], the nominal monarch of both kingdoms. Henry V's brother, John of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Bedford, acted as [[regent]].<ref>DeVries, pp. 24, 26.</ref>

By the beginning of 1429, nearly all of northern France and some parts of the southwest were under foreign control. The English ruled Paris, while the Burgundians controlled [[Reims]]. The latter city was important as the traditional site of French coronations and consecrations, especially since neither claimant to the throne of France had yet been crowned. The English had laid [[The Fifteen Decisive Battles of the World|siege to Orl<U+00E9>ans]], which was the only remaining loyal French city north of the [[Loire]]. Its strategic location along the river made it the last obstacle to an assault on the remainder of the French heartland. In the words of one modern historian, "On the fate of Orl<U+00E9>ans hung that of the entire kingdom."<ref>Pernoud and Clin, p. 10.</ref> No one was optimistic that the city could long withstand the [[siege]].<ref>DeVries, p. 28.</ref>

==Life==
{{seealso|Name of Joan of Arc}}
[[Image:Maison J dArc.jpg|210px|left|thumb|Her birthplace is now a museum. The village church where she worshipped is on the right behind the trees.]]

Joan of Arc's parents' names were [[Jacques d'Arc]] and [[Isabelle Rom<U+00E9>e]]<ref>Jacques d'Arc (1380<U+2013>1440) was a farmer in Domremy who held the post of ''doyen'' a local tax-collector and organiser of village defenses. He married Isabelle de Vouthon (1387<U+2013>1468), called Rom<U+00E9>e, in 1405. Their other children were Jacquemin, Jean, Pierre and Catherine. Charles VII ennobled Jacques and Isabelle's family on 29 December 1429; the Chamber of Accounts registered the family's designation to nobility on 20 January 1430. The grant permitted the family to change their surname to du Lys.</ref> in [[Domr<U+00E9>my-la-Pucelle|Domr<U+00E9>my]], a village which was then in the [[Counts and Dukes of Bar|duchy of Bar]] (and later annexed to the province of Lorraine and renamed Domr<U+00E9>my-la-Pucelle).<ref>Condemnation trial, p. 37.[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/joanofarc-trial.html] (Accessed 23 March 2006)</ref> Her parents owned about 50 acres (0.2 square kilometers) of land and her father supplemented his farming work with a minor position as a village official, collecting taxes and heading the local watch.<ref>Pernoud and Clin, p. 221.</ref> They lived in an isolated patch of northeastern territory that remained loyal to the French crown despite being surrounded by Burgundian lands. Several local raids occurred during her childhood and on one occasion her village was burned. 

Joan said she was about 19 at her trial, so she was born about 1412; she later testified that she experienced her first vision around 1424 at the age of 12 years when she was out alone in a field and heard voices. She had said she cried when they left as they were so beautiful. She would report that [[Michael (archangel)|Saint Michael]], [[Catherine of Alexandria|Saint Catherine]], and [[Saint Margaret the Virgin|Saint Margaret]] told her to drive out the English and bring the Dauphin to Reims for his coronation.<ref>Condemnation trial, pp. 58<U+2013>59.[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/joanofarc-trial.html] (Accessed 23 March 2006)</ref> 

At the age of 16, she asked a kinsman, Durand Lassois, to bring her to nearby [[Vaucouleurs]] where she petitioned the garrison commander, Count [[Robert de Baudricourt]], for permission to visit the royal French court at [[Chinon]]. Baudricourt's sarcastic response did not deter her.<ref>DeVries, pp. 37&ndash;40.</ref> She returned the following January and gained support from two men of standing: Jean de Metz and Bertrand de Poulengy.<ref>Nullification trial testimony of Jean de Metz.[http://www.stjoan-center.com/Trials/null04.html] (Accessed 12 February 2006)</ref> Under their auspices, she gained a second interview where she made a remarkable prediction about a [[Battle of the Herrings|military reversal]] near Orl<U+00E9>ans.<ref>Oliphant, ch. 2.[http://www.authorama.com/book/jeanne-d-arc.html] (Accessed 12 February 2006)</ref>

[[Image:Grande salle ch<U+00E2>teau de Chinon.JPG|180px|thumb|Ruin of the great hall at [[Chinon]] where she met King Charles VII. The castle's only remaining intact tower has also become a museum dedicated to her.]]

Robert de Baudricourt granted her an escort to visit [[Chinon]] after news from the front confirmed her prediction. She made the journey through hostile Burgundian territory in male disguise.<ref>Richey, p. 4. </ref> Upon arriving at the royal court she impressed [[Charles VII of France|Charles VII]] during a private conference. He then ordered background inquiries and a theological examination at [[Poitiers]] to verify her morality. During this time Charles's mother-in-law [[Yolande of Aragon]] was financing a relief expedition to [[Orl<U+00E9>ans]]. Joan petitioned for permission to travel with the army and wear the equipment of a knight. She depended on donated items for her armour, horse, sword, banner, and entourage. Her armor was said to be white. Historian Stephen W. Richey explains her attraction as the only source of hope for a regime that was near collapse:

{{cquote|After years of one humiliating defeat after another, both the military and civil leadership of France were demoralized and discredited. When the Dauphin Charles granted Joan<U+2019>s urgent request to be equipped for war and placed at the head of his army, his decision must have been based in large part on the knowledge that every orthodox, every rational, option had been tried and had failed. Only a regime in the final straits of desperation would pay any heed to an illiterate farm girl who claimed that the voice of God was instructing her to take charge of her country<U+2019>s army and lead it to victory.<ref>Richey, "Joan of Arc: A Military Appreciation".[http://www.stjoan-center.com/military/stephenr.html] (Accessed 12 February 2006)</ref>}}

| style="text-align: left;" | ''Her Letter to the English, March<U+2013>April 1429; Quicherat I, p. 240, trans. Wikipedia.''
|}

She arrived at the [[siege of Orl<U+00E9>ans]] on 29 April 1429, but [[Jean de Dunois|Jean d'Orl<U+00E9>ans]], the acting head of the [[Orl<U+00E9>ans]] ducal family, initially excluded her from war councils and failed to inform her when the army engaged the enemy.<ref>Histories and fictional works often refer to this man by other names. Some call him count of Dunois in reference to a title he received years after Joan's death. During her lifetime he preferred Bastard of Orl<U+00E9>ans, which his contemporaries understood as an honor because it described him as a first cousin of King [[Charles VII of France|Charles VII]]. That name often confuses modern readers because ''"bastard"'' has become a popular insult. ''"Jean d'Orleans"'' is less precise but not anachronistic. For a short biography see Pernoud and Clin, pp. 180<U+2013>181.</ref> This did not prevent her from being present at most councils and battles. The extent of her actual military leadership is a subject of historical debate. Traditional historians such as <U+00C9>douard Perroy conclude that she was a standard bearer whose primary effect was on morale.<ref>Perroy, p. 283.</ref> This type of analysis usually relies on the condemnation trial testimony, where she stated that she preferred her standard to her sword. Recent scholarship that focuses on the nullification trial testimony asserts that her fellow officers esteemed her as a skilled tactician and a successful strategist. Stephen W. Richey's opinion is one example: ''"She proceeded to lead the army in an astounding series of victories that reversed the tide of the war."''<ref>Richey, p. 4.</ref> In either case, historians agree that the army enjoyed remarkable success during her brief career.<ref>Pernoud and Clin, p. 230.</ref>

=== Leadership ===
[[Image:Chateau Beaugency ballon.jpg|210px|thumb|right|The inner keep at [[Beaugency]] is one of the few surviving fortifications from Joan's battles. English defenders retreated to the tower at upper right after the French breached the town wall.]]

She defied the cautious strategy that had characterized French leadership. During the five months of siege before her arrival, the defenders of Orl<U+00E9>ans had attempted only one aggressive move and that had ended in disaster. On 4 May the French attacked and captured the outlying fortress of Saint Loup, which she followed on 5 May with a march to a second fortress called Saint Jean le Blanc. Finding it deserted, this became a bloodless victory. The next day she opposed Jean d'Orleans at a war council where she demanded another assault on the enemy. D'Orleans ordered the city gates locked to prevent another battle, but she summoned the townsmen and common soldiers and forced the mayor to unlock a gate. With the aid of only one captain she rode out and captured the fortress of Saint Augustins. That evening she learned she had been excluded from a war council where the leaders had decided to wait for reinforcements before acting again. Disregarding this decision, she insisted on assaulting the main English stronghold called ''"les Tourelles"'' on 7 May.<ref>DeVries, pp. 74<U+2013>83</ref> Contemporaries acknowledged her as the heroine of the engagement after she sustained an arrow wound to her neck but returned wounded to lead the final charge.<ref>Devout Catholics regard this as proof of her divine mission. At Chinon and Poitiers she had declared that she would give a sign at Orl<U+00E9>ans. The lifting of the siege gained her the support of prominent clergy such as the [[Archbishop of Embrun]] and theologian [[Jean Gerson]], who both wrote supportive treatises immediately following this event.</ref> 

{| class="toccolours" style="float: left; margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 1em; font-size: 85%; background:#c6dbf7; color:black; width:30em; max-width: 40%;" cellspacing="5"
| style="text-align: left;" | "...the Maiden lets you know that here, in eight days, she has chased the English out of all the places they held on the river Loire by attack or other means: they are dead or prisoners or discouraged in battle. Believe what you have heard about the earl of Suffolk, the lord la Pole and his brother, the lord Talbot, the lord Scales, and Sir Fastolf; many more knights and captains than these are defeated."

The sudden victory at Orl<U+00E9>ans led to many proposals for offensive action. The English expected an attempt to recapture Paris or an attack on Normandy. In the aftermath of the unexpected victory, she persuaded Charles VII to grant her co-command of the army with Duke [[John II of Alen<U+00E7>on]] and gained royal permission for her plan to recapture nearby bridges along the Loire as a prelude to an advance on Reims and a coronation. Hers was a bold proposal because Reims was roughly twice as far away as Paris and deep in enemy territory.<ref>DeVries, pp. 96&ndash;97.</ref>

[[Image:Notre Dame de Reims - d<U+00E9>tail haut.JPG|right|thumb|180px|[[Notre-Dame de Reims]], traditional site of French coronations. The structure had additional spires prior to a 1481 fire.]]

The army recovered [[Battle of Jargeau|Jargeau]] on 12 June, [[Battle of Meung-sur-Loire|Meung-sur-Loire]] on 15 June, then [[Battle of Beaugency (1429)|Beaugency]] on 17 June. The Duke of Alen<U+00E7>on agreed to all of Joan's decisions. Other commanders including Jean d'Orl<U+00E9>ans had been impressed with her performance at Orl<U+00E9>ans and became her supporters. Alen<U+00E7>on credited her for saving his life at Jargeau, where she warned him of an imminent artillery attack.<ref> Nullification trial testimony of Jean, Duke of Alen<U+00E7>on.[http://www.stjoan-center.com/Trials/null07.html] (Accessed 12 February 2006)</ref> During the same battle she withstood a blow from a stone cannonball to her helmet as she climbed a scaling ladder. An expected English relief force arrived in the area on 18 June under the command of Sir [[John Fastolf]]. The [[Battle of Patay|battle at Patay]] might be compared to [[Battle of Agincourt|Agincourt]] in reverse. The French vanguard attacked before the English [[English longbow|archers]] could finish defensive preparations. A rout ensued that devastated the main body of the English army and killed or captured most of its commanders. Fastolf escaped with a small band of soldiers and became the scapegoat for the English humiliation. The French suffered minimal losses.<ref>DeVries, pp. 114&ndash;115.</ref>

The French army set out for Reims from Gien-sur-Loire on 29 June and accepted the conditional surrender of the Burgundian-held city of [[Auxerre]] on 3 July. Every other town in their path returned to French allegiance without resistance. [[Troyes]], the site of the treaty that had tried to disinherit Charles VII, capitulated after a bloodless four-day siege.<ref>Ibid., pp. 122&ndash;126.</ref> The army was in short supply of food by the time it reached Troyes. Edward Lucie-Smith cites this as an example of why she was more lucky than skilled: a wandering friar named Brother Richard had been preaching about the end of the world at Troyes and had convinced local residents to plant beans, a crop with an early harvest. The hungry army arrived as the beans ripened.<ref>Lucie-Smith, pp. 156&ndash;160.</ref>

Reims opened its gates on 16 July. The coronation took place the following morning. Although Joan and the duke of Alen<U+00E7>on urged a prompt march on Paris, the royal court pursued a negotiated truce with the duke of Burgundy. Duke Philip the Good broke the agreement, using it as a stalling tactic to reinforce the defense of Paris.<ref>DeVries, p. 134.</ref> The French army marched through towns near Paris during the interim and accepted more peaceful surrenders. The Duke of Bedford headed an English force and confronted the French army in a standoff on 15 August. The French assault at Paris ensued on 8 September. Despite a crossbow bolt wound to the leg, Joan continued directing the troops until the day's fighting ended. The following morning she received a royal order to withdraw. Most historians blame French grand chamberlain [[Georges de la Tr<U+00E9>moille]] for the political blunders that followed the coronation.<ref>These range from mild associations of intrigue to scholarly invective.

=== Capture ===
[[Image:Tour Jeanne D'Arc10.jpg|thumb|180px|right|The tower in [[Rouen]], where she was imprisoned during her trial, has become known as the Joan of Arc tower. During one of her escape attempts, she leaped from a different tower, probably of similar construction.]]

After minor action at La-Charit<U+00E9>-sur-Loire in November and December, Joan went to [[Compi<U+00E8>gne]] the following April to defend against an [[Siege of Compi<U+00E8>gne|English and Burgundian siege]]. A skirmish on 23 May 1430 led to her capture. When she ordered a retreat, she assumed the place of honor as the last to leave the field. Burgundians surrounded the rear guard.<ref>DeVries, pp. 161<U+2013>170.</ref>

<span style="white-space: nowrap">It was customary</span>
for a captive's family to ransom a [[prisoner of war]]. Unfortunately, Joan and her family lacked the financial resources. Many historians condemn King [[Charles VII of France|Charles VII]] for failing to intervene. She attempted several escapes, on one occasion jumping from her 70 foot (21 m) tower in [[Vermandois]] to the soft earth of a dry moat, after which she was moved to the Burgundian town of Arras. The English government eventually purchased her from Duke Philip of Burgundy. Bishop [[Pierre Cauchon]] of [[Beauvais]], an English partisan, assumed a prominent role in these negotiations and her later trial.

=== Trial ===
{{seealso|Trial of Joan of Arc}}
The trial for heresy was politically motivated.  The Duke of Bedford claimed the throne of France for his nephew Henry VI. She had been responsible for the rival coronation so to condemn her was to undermine her king's legitimacy. Legal proceedings commenced on 9 January 1431 at [[Rouen]], the seat of the English occupation government.<ref>Judges' investigations 9 January&ndash;26 March, ordinary trial 26 March&ndash;24 May, recantation 24 May, relapse trial 28 May&ndash;29.</ref> The procedure was irregular on a number of points. In 1456, Pope Callixtus III declared her innocent of the heresy charges brought against her.

[[Image:joan of arc interrogation.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Joan interrogated in her prison cell by the cardinal of Winchester. By [[Hippolyte Delaroche]], 1824, [[Mus<U+00E9>e des Beaux-Arts]], Rouen, France.]]

To summarize some major problems, the jurisdiction of judge Bishop Cauchon was a legal fiction.<ref>The retrial verdict later affirmed that Cauchon had no right to try the case. See also ''Joan of Arc: Her Story'', by Regine Pernoud and Marie-Veronique Clin, p. 108. The vice-inquisitor of France objected to the trial on jurisdictional grounds at its outset. </ref> He owed his appointment to his partisan support of the English government that financed the entire trial. Clerical notary Nicolas Bailly, commissioned to collect testimony against Joan, could find no adverse evidence.<ref>Nullification trial testimony of Father Nicholas Bailly.[http://www.stjoan-center.com/Trials/null03.html] (Accessed 12 February 2006)</ref> Without such evidence the court lacked grounds to initiate a trial. Opening a trial anyway, the court also violated ecclesiastical law in denying her right to a legal advisor. Upon the opening of the first public examination Joan complained that those present were all partisans against her and asked for "ecclesiastics of the French side" to be invited.<ref>Taylor, Craig, ''Joan of Arc: La Pucelle'' p. 137.</ref>

The trial record demonstrates her remarkable intellect. The transcript's most famous exchange is an exercise in subtlety. "Asked if she knew she was in God's grace, she answered: 'If I am not, may God put me there; and if I am, may God so keep me.'"<ref>Condemnation trial, p. 52.[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/joanofarc-trial.html] (Accessed 12 February 2006)</ref> The question is a scholarly trap. Church doctrine held that no one could be certain of being in God's grace. If she had answered yes, then she would have convicted herself of [[Christian heresy|heresy]]. If she had answered no, then she would have confessed her own guilt. Notary Boisguillaume would later testify that at the moment the court heard this reply, "Those who were interrogating her were stupefied."<ref>Pernoud and Clin, p. 112.</ref> In the twentieth century [[George Bernard Shaw]] would find this dialogue so compelling that sections of his play ''[[Saint Joan (play)|Saint Joan]]'' are literal translations of the trial record.<ref>Shaw, "Saint Joan." Penguin Classics; Reissue edition (2001). ISBN 0-14-043791-6</ref>

Several court functionaries later testified that significant portions of the transcript were altered in her disfavor. Many clerics served under compulsion, including the inquisitor, Jean LeMaitre, and a few even received death threats from the English. Under [[Inquisition|Inquisitorial]] guidelines, Joan should have been confined to an [[ecclesiology|ecclesiastical]] prison under the supervision of female guards (i.e., nuns). Instead, the English kept her in a [[Secularity (non-religiosity)|secular]] prison guarded by their own soldiers. Bishop Cauchon denied Joan's appeals to the [[Council of Basel]] and the pope, which should have stopped his proceeding.<ref>Pernoud and Clin, p. 130.</ref>

=== Execution ===
[[Image:Eglise Sainte Jeanne dArc.jpg|180px|right|thumb|A modern church in Joan's honor stands on the site of her execution in Rouen.]]

[[Heresy]] was a capital crime only for a repeat offense. Joan agreed to wear women's clothes when she abjured. A few days later she was [[sexual assault|sexually assaulted]] in prison.<ref>See Pernoud, p. 220, which quotes appellate testimony by Friar Martin Ladvenu and Friar Isambart de la Pierre.</ref> She resumed male attire either as a defense against molestation or, in the testimony of Jean Massieu, because her dress had been stolen and she was left with nothing else to wear.<ref>Nullification trial testimony of Jean Massieu.[http://www.stjoan-center.com/Trials/null02.html] (Accessed 12 February 2006)</ref>

Eyewitnesses described the scene of the [[execution by burning]] on 30 May 1431. Tied to a tall pillar in the Vieux-Marche in Rouen, she asked two of the clergy, Fr Martin Ladvenu and Fr Isambart de la Pierre, to hold a [[crucifix]] before her. A peasant also constructed a small [[cross]] which she put in the front of her dress. After she expired, the English raked back the coals to expose her charred body so that no one could claim she had escaped alive, then burned the body twice more to reduce it to ashes and prevent any collection of relics. They cast her remains into the [[Seine]].<ref>In February, 2006 a team of forensic scientists announced the beginning of a six-month study to assess bone and skin remains from a museum at [[Chinon]] and reputed to be those of the heroine.

=== Retrial ===
A posthumous retrial opened after the war ended. [[Pope Callixtus III]] authorized this proceeding, also known as the "nullification trial", at the request of Inquisitor-General [[Jean Brehal]] and Joan's mother Isabelle Rom<U+00E9>e. The aim of the trial was to investigate whether the trial of condemnation and its verdict had been handled justly and according to canon law. Investigations started with an inquest by clergyman Guillaume Bouille. Brehal conducted an investigation in 1452. A formal appeal followed in November, 1455. The appellate process included clergy from throughout Europe and observed standard court procedure. A panel of theologians analyzed testimony from 115 witnesses. Brehal drew up his final summary in June, 1456, which describes Joan as a [[martyr]] and implicates the late Pierre Cauchon with heresy for having convicted an innocent woman in pursuit of a [[Secularity (non-religiosity)|secular]] vendetta. The court declared her innocence on 7 July 1456.<ref>Nullification trial sentence rehabilitation.[http://www.stjoan-center.com/Trials/null13.html]  (Accessed 12 February 2006)</ref>

==Clothing==
[[Image:ingres coronation charles vii.jpg|thumb|right|180px|''Joan at the coronation of Charles VII'', by [[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres]] (1854), is typical of attempts to feminize her appearance. Note the long hair and the skirt around the armor.]]

Joan of Arc wore men's clothing between her departure from Vaucouleurs and her abjuration at Rouen.<ref>Condemnation trial, pp. 78&ndash;79.[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/joanofarc-trial.html] (Accessed 12 February 2006)</ref> This raised theological questions in her own era and raised other questions in the twentieth century. The technical reason for her execution was a biblical clothing law.<ref>[[Deuteronomy]] 22:5.[http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext05/bib0510.txt] (Accessed 22 March 2006).</ref> The nullification trial reversed the conviction in part because the condemnation proceeding had failed to consider the doctrinal exceptions to that stricture.

Doctrinally speaking, she was safe to disguise herself as a page during a journey through enemy territory and she was safe to wear armor during battle. The ''Chronique de la Pucelle'' states that it deterred molestation while she was camped in the field. Clergy who testified at her rehabilitation trial affirmed that she continued to wear male clothing in prison to deter [[molestation]] and [[rape]].<ref>Nullification trial testimony of Guillaume de Manchon.[http://www.stjoan-center.com/Trials/#nullification] (Accessed 12 February 2006)</ref> Preservation of [[chastity]] was another justifiable reason for crossdressing: her apparel would have slowed an assailant, and men would be less likely to think of her as a sex object in any case.<ref>According to medieval clothing expert Adrien Harmand, she wore two layers of pants (trousers in British-English) attached to the doublet with 20 fastenings. The outer pants were made of a boot-like leather. "Jeanne d'Arc, son costume, son armure."[http://lerozier.free.fr/chausses.htm]{{fr_icon}} (Accessed 23 March 2006)</ref> 

She referred the court to the Poitiers inquiry when questioned on the matter during her condemnation trial. The Poitiers record no longer survives but circumstances indicate the Poitiers clerics approved her practice. In other words, she had a mission to do a man's work so it was fitting that she dress the part.<ref>Condemnation trial, p. 78.[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/joanofarc-trial.html] (Accessed 12 February 2006) Retrial testimony of Brother Seguin de Seguin, Professor of Theology at Poitiers, does not mention clothing directly, but constitutes a wholehearted endorsement of her piety.[http://www.stjoan-center.com/Trials/null05.html] (Accessed 12 February 2006)</ref> She also kept her hair cut short through her military campaigns and while in prison. Her supporters, such as the theologian [[Jean Gerson]], defended her hairstyle, as did Inquisitor Brehal during the Rehabilitation trial.<ref>Fraioli, "Joan of Arc: The Early Debate," p. 131.</ref>

==Visions==
[[Image:Jeanne d' Arc (Eugene Thirion).jpg|180px|left|thumb|''Jeanne d' Arc'', by Eugene Thirion (1876). Late 19th century images such as this often had political undertones because of French territorial cessions to Germany in 1871. (Chautou, Church of Notre Dame)]]

Joan of Arc's religious visions have interested many people. The consensus among scholars is that her faith was sincere. She identified [[Saint Margaret the Virgin|Saint Margaret]], [[Catherine of Alexandria|Saint Catherine]], and [[Michael (archangel)|Saint Michael]] as the source of her [[revelation]]s although there is some ambiguity as to which of several identically named saints she intended. Some Catholics regard her visions as divine inspiration.

Analysis of her visions is problematic since the main source of information on this topic is the condemnation trial transcript in which she defied customary courtroom procedure about a witness's oath and specifically refused to answer every question about her visions. She complained that a standard witness oath would conflict with an oath she had previously sworn to maintain confidentiality about meetings with her king. It remains unknown to what extent the surviving record may represent the fabrications of corrupt court officials or her own possible fabrications to protect state secrets.<ref>Condemnation trial, pp. 36<U+2013>37, 41<U+2013>42, 48<U+2013>49. (Accessed 1 September 2006)</ref> Some historians sidestep speculation about the visions by asserting that her belief in her calling is more relevant than questions about the visions' ultimate origin.<ref> In a parenthetical note to a military biography, DeVries asserts: <blockquote>"The visions, or their veracity, are not in themselves important for this study. What is important, in fact what is key to Joan's history as a military leader, is that ''she'' (author's emphasis) believed that they came from God," p. 35.</ref></blockquote>

Documents from her own era and historians prior to the twentieth century generally assume that she was both healthy and sane. A number of more recent scholars attempted to explain her visions in psychiatric or neurological terms. Potential diagnoses have included [[epilepsy]], [[migraine]], [[tuberculosis]], and [[schizophrenia]].<ref>Many of these hypotheses were devised by people whose expertise is in history rather than medicine. For a sampling of papers that passed peer review in medical journals, see ""I heard voices...": From semiology, a historical review, and a new hypothesis on the presumed epilepsy of Joan of Arc," d'Orsi G, Tinuper P, ''Epilepsy Behav.'' August, 2006; 9(1):152<U+2013>7. Epub 2006 5 June [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=pubmed&cmd=Retrieve&dopt=AbstractPlus&list_uids=16750938&query_hl=1&itool=pubmed_docsum] (idiopathic partial epilepsy with auditory features); "Joan of Arc," Foote-Smith E, Bayne L, ''Epilepsia.''

December, 1984; 77(12):1488<U+2013>90 (various psychiatric definitions) [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?itool=abstractplus&db=pubmed&cmd=Retrieve&dopt=abstractplus&list_uids=6390693]; "The schizophrenia of Joan of Arc," Allen C, ''Hist Med.'' Autumn<U+2013>Winter 1975;6(3<U+2013>4):4<U+2013>9 (schizophrenia) [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=pubmed&cmd=Retrieve&dopt=AbstractPlus&list_uids=11630627&query_hl=1&itool=pubmed_docsum]. (Accessed 1 September 2006)</ref> None of the putative diagnoses have gained consensus support because, although [[hallucination]] and [[religious]] enthusiasm can be symptomatic of various syndromes, other characteristic symptoms conflict with other known facts of Joan's life. Two experts who analyze a temporal lobe tuberculoma hypothesis in the medical journal ''Neuropsychobiology'' express their misgivings this way: <blockquote>"It is difficult to draw final conclusions, but it would seem unlikely that widespread tuberculosis, a serious disease, was present in this 'patient' whose life-style and activities would surely have been impossible had such a serious disease been present."<ref>"A historical case of disseminated chronic tuberculosis," Nores JM, Yakovleff Y, ''Neuropsychobiology.'' 1995;32(2):79<U+2013>80 (temporal lobe tuberculoma) (Accessed 1 September 2006)[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=pubmed&cmd=Retrieve&dopt=AbstractPlus&list_uids=7477805&query_hl=1&itool=pubmed_docsum]</ref></blockquote> Historian R<U+00E9>gine Pernoud was sometimes sarcastic about speculative medical interpretations. In response to another such theory alleging that she suffered from bovine tuberculosis as a result of drinking [[pasteurization|unpasteurized]] milk, Pernoud wrote that if drinking unpasteurized milk can produce such potential benefits for the nation, then the French government should stop mandating the pasteurization of milk.<ref>Pernoud, p. 275.</ref> Ralph Hoffman, professor of psychology at Yale University, points out that visionary and creative states including ''"hearing voices"'' are not necessarily signs of mental illness and names her religious inspiration as a possible exception although he offers no speculation as to alternative causes.<ref>Hoffman, "Auditory Hallucinations: What's It Like Hearing Voices?" in HealthyPlace.com, 27 September 2003.[http://www.healthyplace.com/Communities/Thought_Disorders/schizo/articles/hearing_voices.htm] (Accessed 12 February 2006)</ref>

Among the specific challenges that potential diagnoses such as [[schizophrenia]] face is the slim likelihood that any person with such a disorder could gain favor in the court of King Charles VII. His own father, Charles VI, was popularly known as "Charles the Mad," and much of the political and military decline that France had suffered during his reign could be attributed to the power vacuum that his episodes of insanity had produced. The previous king had believed he was made of glass, a delusion no courtier had mistaken for a religious awakening. Fears that King Charles VII would manifest the same insanity may have factored into the attempt to disinherit him at Troyes. This stigma was so persistent that contemporaries of the next generation would attribute to inherited madness the breakdown that England's King [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]] was to suffer in 1453: Henry VI was nephew to Charles VII and grandson to Charles VI. Upon her arrival at Chinon the royal counselor Jacques G<U+00E9>lu cautioned, 

{{cquote|One should not lightly alter any policy because of conversation with a girl, a peasant... so susceptible to illusions; one should not make oneself ridiculous in the sight of foreign nations....}}

Contrary to modern stereotypes about the Middle Ages, the court of Charles VII was shrewd and skeptical on the subject of mental health.<ref>Pernoud and Clin, pp. 3, 169, 183. Richard C. Famiglietti, "Royal Intrigue: Crisis at the Court of Charles VI, 1392&ndash;1420". New York: AMS Press, 1987. ISBN 0-404-61439-6.</ref><ref>Nullification trial testimony of Dame Marguerite de Touroulde, widow of a king's counselor: "I heard from those that brought her to the king that at first they thought she was mad, and intended to put her away in some ditch, but while on the way they felt moved to do everything according to her good pleasure."[http://www.stjoan-center.com/Trials/null05.html] (Accessed 12 February 2006)</ref>

Besides the physical rigor of her military career, which would seem to exclude many medical hypotheses, Joan of Arc displayed none of the cognitive impairment that can accompany some major mental illnesses when symptoms are present. She remained astute to the end of her life and rehabilitation trial testimony frequently marvels at her astuteness: 

{{cquote|Often they [the judges] turned from one question to another, changing about, but, notwithstanding this, she answered prudently, and evinced a wonderful memory.<ref>Nullification trial testimony of Guillaume de Manchon.[http://www.stjoan-center.com/Trials/null09.html] (Accessed 12 February 2006)</ref>}}

Her subtle replies under interrogation even forced the court to stop holding public sessions.<ref>Pernoud and Clin, p. 112.</ref> If her visions had some medical or psychiatric origin then she would have been an exceptional case.

==Legacy==
{{Further|[[Alternative historical interpretations of Joan of Arc]], [[Cultural depictions of Joan of Arc]], [[Canonization of Joan of Arc]]}}

== Hundred Years War ==
The Hundred Years' War continued for 22 years after her death. Charles VII succeeded in retaining legitimacy as king of France in spite of a rival coronation held for Henry VI in December 1431 on the boy's tenth birthday. Before England could rebuild its military leadership and longbow corps, lost during 1429, the country lost its alliance with Burgundy at the [[Treaty of Arras (1435)|Treaty of Arras]] in 1435. The duke of Bedford died the same year and Henry VI became the youngest king of England to rule without a regent and his weak leadership were probably the most important factors in ending the conflict. Kelly DeVries argues that Joan of Arc's aggressive use of artillery and frontal assaults influenced French tactics for the rest of the war.<ref>DeVries, pp. 179&ndash;180.</ref> 

Joan of Arc became a semi-legendary figure for the next four centuries.  The main sources of information about her were chronicles. Five original manuscripts of her condemnation trial surfaced in old archives during the 19th century. Soon historians also located the complete records of her rehabilitation trial, which contained sworn testimony from 115 witnesses, and the original French notes for the Latin condemnation trial transcript. Various contemporary letters also emerged, three of which carry the signature ''"Jehanne"'' in the unsteady hand of a person learning to write.<ref>Pernoud and Clin, pp. 247&ndash;264.</ref> This unusual wealth of primary source material is one reason DeVries declares, "No person of the Middle Ages, male or female, has been the subject of more study".<ref>DeVries in "Fresh Verdicts on Joan of Arc," edited by Bonnie Wheeler, p. 3.</ref>

[[Image:Jehanne signature.jpg|thumb|left|210px|She dictated her letters. Three of the surviving ones are signed.]]

Joan of Arc came from an obscure village and rose to prominence, when she was barely more than a child, and she did so as an uneducated peasant. The French and English kings had justified the ongoing war through competing interpretations of the thousand-year-old [[Salic law]]. The conflict had been an inheritance feud between monarchs. She gave meaning to appeals such as that of squire Jean de Metz when he asked, "Must the king be driven from the kingdom; and are we to be English?"<ref>Nullification trial testimony of Jean de Metz.[http://www.stjoan-center.com/Trials/null04.html] (Accessed 12 February 2006)</ref> In the words of Stephen Richey, ''"She turned what had been a dry dynastic squabble that left the common people unmoved except for their own suffering into a passionately popular war of national liberation."''<ref>Richey,[http://www.stjoan-center.com/military/stephenr.html] (Accessed 12 12 February 2006)</ref> Richey also expresses the breadth of her subsequent appeal:

''"The people who came after her in the five centuries since her death tried to make everything of her: demonic fanatic, spiritual mystic, naive and tragically ill-used tool of the powerful, creator and icon of modern popular nationalism, adored heroine, saint. She insisted, even when threatened with torture and faced with death by fire, that she was guided by voices from God. Voices or no voices, her achievements leave anyone who knows her story shaking his head in amazed wonder."''<ref>Ibid.</ref>

In 1452, during the postwar investigation into her execution, the Church declared that a religious play in her honor at Orl<U+00E9>ans would qualify as a [[pilgrimage]] meriting an [[indulgence]]. She became a symbol of the [[Catholic League (French)|Catholic League]] during the 16th century. Monsignor [[F<U+00E9>lix Dupanloup]], [[Bishop of Orl<U+00E9>ans]] from 1849 to 1878, led the effort for Joan's [[beatification]], but did not live to see it come about. 

Joan of Arc's beatification finally came about in the year 1909 - directly following upon the passage of the [[1905 French law on the Separation of the Churches and the State]], at the time considered a major blow to the Catholic Church's position in French society. Her [[canonization of Joan of Arc|canonization]] followed on 16 May 1920. Her [[feast day]] is 30 May. As Saint Joan of Arc, she has become one of the most popular saints of the Roman Catholic Church.<ref>She is the most requested saint profile at Catholic.org. [http://www.catholic.org/saints/popular.php] (Accessed 12 February 2006)</ref>

Joan of Arc was not a feminist. She operated within a religious tradition that believed an exceptional person from any level of society might receive a divine calling. She expelled women from the French army and may have struck one stubborn camp follower with the flat of a sword.<ref>Contrary to popular myth, the primary role of camp followers was not prostitution. They performed support functions such as laundry, cooking, and hauling. Female camp followers were often the wives of soldiers. Some prostitution also took place. Byron C. Hacker and Margaret Vining, "The World of Camp and Train: Women's Changing Roles in Early Modern Armies".

[http://www.stjoan-center.com/Trials/null07.html] (Accessed 12 February 2006)</ref> Nonetheless, some of her most significant aid came from women. King Charles VII's mother-in-law, Yolande of Aragon, confirmed Joan's virginity and financed her departure to Orl<U+00E9>ans. Joan of Luxembourg, aunt to the count of Luxembourg who held custody of her after Compi<U+00E8>gne, alleviated her conditions of captivity and may have delayed her sale to the English. Finally, [[Anne of Burgundy]], the duchess of Bedford and wife to the regent of England, declared Joan a virgin during pretrial inquiries.<ref>These tests, which her confessor describes as hymen investigations, are not reliable measures of virginity. However, they signified approval from matrons of the highest social rank at key moments of her life.

Joan of Arc has been a political symbol in France since the time of [[Napoleon]]. [[Classical liberalism|Liberals]] emphasized her humble origins. Early [[Conservatism|conservatives]] stressed her support of the [[monarchy]]. Later conservatives recalled her nationalism. During [[World War II]], both the [[Vichy France|Vichy Regime]] and the [[French Resistance]] used her image: Vichy propaganda remembered her campaign against the English with posters that showed British warplanes bombing [[Rouen]] and the ominous caption: ''"They Always Return to the Scene of Their Crimes."'' The resistance emphasized her fight against foreign occupation and her origins in the province of [[Moselle|Lorraine]], which had fallen under [[Nazism|Nazi]] control. 

Three separate vessels of the [[French Navy]] have been named after her, including a [[Jeanne d'Arc (R 97)|helicopter carrier]] currently in active service. At present the controversial [[French far-right]] political party [[National Front (France)|Front National]] holds rallies at her statues, reproduces her likeness in party publications, and uses a tricolor flame partly symbolic of her martyrdom as its emblem. This party's opponents sometimes satirize its appropriation of her image.<ref>Front National publicity logos include the tricolor flame and reproductions of statues depicting her. The graphics forums at ''<U+00C9>tapes'' magazine include a variety of political posters from the 2002 presidential election. [http://www.etapes.com/index.php?num=84&rub=forum&forum=1&p=0] {{fr_icon}} (Accessed 7 February 2006)</ref> The French civic holiday in her honor is the second Sunday of May.

[[Traditionalist Catholic|Traditional Roman Catholics]], in France and elsewhere, also use her as a symbol of inspiration, often comparing the 1988 excommunication of Archbishop [[Marcel Lefebvre]] (founder of the [[Society of St. Pius X]] and a dissident against the Vatican II reforms) to her excommunication.

==Alleged relics disproven==
In 1867, a jar was found in a Paris pharmacy with the inscription "Remains found under the stake of Joan of Arc, virgin of Orleans".
They consisted of a charred human rib, carbonized wood, a piece of linen and a cat femur <U+2014> explained as the practice of throwing black cats onto the pyre of witches. The Catholic Church recognized them {{Fact|date=October 2008}}, and they are now in a Chinon museum.  In 2006, [[Philippe Charlier]], a forensic scientist at [[Raymond Poincar<U+00E9> Hospital]] ([[Garches]]) was authorized to study the relics. [[Radiocarbon dating|Carbon-14 tests]] and [[spectrometry]] were performed, and the results<ref name="Nature">''[[Declan Butler]].

The charred appearance comes from the embalming substances, not from combustion. Apparently the mummy was <!--carnomumia-->part of the ingredients of Medieval [[pharmacopeia]] and it was relabelled in a time of French nationalism.
