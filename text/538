'''Eric Andersen''' (born February 14, 1943) is an [[United States|American]] [[singer-songwriter]].

== Overview ==
Eric Andersen was born in [[Pittsburgh]].  In the early-1960s, he was part of the [[Greenwich Village]] folk scene in [[New York City]]. His best-known songs from that time are "Violets of Dawn", "Come to My Bedside" and "[[Thirsty Boots]]" (the latter recorded by [[Judy Collins]], amongst others). 

In 1964, Andersen made his debut at Gerdes Folk City in a live audition for Vanguard Records and later that year performed at the [[Newport Folk Festival]]. Coincidentally, on both occasions he was preceded by [[Jose Feliciano]], who was also making his debut performances. In 1966, Andersen starred in the [[Andy Warhol]] movie ''Space''.  He also took part in the [[Festival Express]] tour across Canada in 1970 with the [[Grateful Dead]], [[Janis Joplin]], [[The Band]] and others.

In 1972, Andersen signed with [[Columbia Records|Columbia]] and issued his most commercially successful album ''[[Blue River (album)|Blue River]]''. However, the master tapes of his follow-up album ''[[Stages: The Lost Album|Stages]]'' were lost before the album could be released, resulting in the loss of much of the momentum he had gained with ''Blue River''.  The ''Stages'' tapes were found nearly two decades later and issued in 1991 as ''[[Stages: The Lost Album]]''.

Andersen parted ways with Columbia and recorded sporadically for a number of labels throughout the remainder of the 1970s and into the early 1980s.  In 1975 he performed at the opening show of Bob Dylan's [[Rolling Thunder Revue]] at Gerde's Folk City and again in Niagara Falls. After falling into obscurity for a number of years, he reemerged in 1988 with a new album, ''Ghosts Upon the Road''.  Though the album only did modestly well, it was widely praised and placed on a number of critics' year-end "best of" lists.  

In the early 1990s, Andersen formed the trio [[Danko/Fjeld/Andersen]] together with [[Rick Danko]] ([[The Band]]) and [[Jonas Fjeld]]. The trio recorded three albums and performed together for nine years. In 1998, Andersen released his first solo album in a decade, ''Memory of the Future''. Praised as "dreamy and introspective", the album was followed two years later by ''You Can't Relive The Past'', which included original blues numbers as well as a selection of songs co-written with [[Townes Van Zandt]]. A double album ''Beat Avenue'' followed in 2003. Besides mostly rock-dominated ballads, the album's 26-minute title track was a jazzy beat poem relating his experiences among San Francisco's [[Beat Generation|beat community]] of artists on the day of President [[John F. Kennedy]]'s assassination.

Andersen's next albums, ''The Street Was Always There'' in 2004 and ''Waves'' in 2005, were both produced by multi-instrumentalist [[Robert Aaron]]. In addition to covers of his own songs, the albums featured new versions of classics by his sixties contemporaries and friends, including [[David Blue (musician)|David Blue]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[Richard Fari<U+00F1>a]], [[Tim Hardin]], [[Peter La Farge]], [[Fred Neil]], [[Phil Ochs]], [[Buffy Sainte-Marie]], [[Paul Siebel]], [[Patrick Sky]], [[Tom Paxton]], [[John Sebastian]], [[Happy Traum]], [[Lou Reed]] and [[Tom Rush]]. His next album ''Blue Rain'', released in 2007, was his first live album. It was recorded in Norway and contains a blend of blues, jazz and folk.

In 2009, Andersen contributed an essay entitled ''The Danger Zone'' to the ''Naked Lunch @ 50: Anniversary Essays'', a book volume edited by [[Oliver Harris]] and [[Ian MacFadyen]] devoted to [[William Burroughs]]<U+2019> masterpiece the ''[[Naked Lunch]]'', considered one of the landmark publications in the history of [[American literature]]. Furthermore, Andersen will be releasing a new album entitled ''Woodstock under the Stars'', which features live performances over the last 7-8 years. Among the tracks are live performances of songs as "I Shall Go Unbounded" and "Rain Falls Down in Amsterdam".

In his almost 45-year career, Andersen has issued more than 25 albums to which many artists have contributed, including [[Joan Baez]], [[Dan Fogelberg]], [[Al Kooper]], [[Willie Nile]], [[Joni Mitchell]], [[Leon Russell]], [[Richard Thompson (musician)|Richard Thompson]], [[Rick Danko]], [[Garth Hudson]], [[Eric Bazilian]], [[Tony Garnier (musician)|Tony Garnier]], [[Howie Epstein]] and many others. His songs have been recorded by artists all over the world, including the [[Blues Project]], [[Johnny Cash]], [[Judy Collins]], [[Peter, Paul & Mary]], [[John Denver]], [[Ricky Nelson]], [[Fairport Convention]], [[Grateful Dead]], [[Ratdog]] ([[Bob Weir]]), [[Linda Ronstadt]], [[Gillian Welch]] and [[Pete Seeger]].
