'''Turkish''' (''{{lang|tr|T<U+00FC>rk<U+00E7>e}}'', {{Audio-IPA|Turkce.ogg|[ty<U+027E>kt<U+0283>e]}}) is a [[Turkic languages|Turkic language]], and thus a member of the proposed [[Altaic languages|Altaic language family]]. It is spoken predominantly in [[Turkey]], with smaller communities of speakers in [[Cyprus]], [[Greece]] and [[Eastern Europe]], as well as by several million immigrants in [[Western Europe]]. Turkish is the most widely spoken Turkic language, with 65<U+2013>73 million native speakers worldwide. 

The roots of the language can be traced to [[Central Asia]], with the first written records dating back nearly 1,200 years. To the west, the influence of [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]]<U+2014>the immediate precursor of today's Turkish<U+2014>spread as the [[Ottoman Empire]] expanded. In 1928, as one of [[Atat<U+00FC>rk's Reforms]] in the early years of the new [[Turkish Republic]], the [[Ottoman Turkish alphabet|Ottoman script]] was replaced with a phonetic variant of the [[Latin alphabet]].  Concurrently, the newly founded [[Turkish Language Association]] initiated a drive to reform the language by removing [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic ]] loanwords in favor of native variants and coinages from Turkic roots.

The distinctive characteristics of Turkish are [[vowel harmony]] and extensive [[Agglutinative language|agglutination]]. The basic word order of Turkish is [[Subject Object Verb]]. Turkish has a [[T-V distinction]]: second-person plural forms can be used for individuals as a sign of respect. Turkish also has no [[noun class]]es or [[grammatical gender]].

{{Main|Turkic languages|Altaic languages}}
Turkish is a member of the Turkish, or Western, subgroup of the [[Oghuz languages]], which includes [[Gagauz language|Gagauz]] and [[Azerbaijani language|Azeri]]. The Oghuz languages form the Southwestern subgroup of the [[Turkic languages]], a language family comprising some thirty living languages spoken across [[Eastern Europe]], [[Central Asia]] and [[Siberia]], which some linguists believe to be a part of a larger [[Altaic languages|Altaic language family]].<ref name="Ethnologue Altaic">{{cite web|author=Gordon, Raymond G., Jr. (ed.)|authorlink=Ethnologue|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_family.asp?subid=90009|title=Ethnologue: Languages of the World, Fifteenth edition.

==History==
[[Image:Kyzyl orkhon inscription.jpg|thumb|right|120px|[[Old Turkic language|Old Turkic]] inscription with the [[Orkhon script]] (c. 8th century). [[Kyzyl]], [[Russia]]]]
{{seealso|Turkic peoples|History of the Turkic peoples}}
The first records of the [[Turkic languages]] date back to some time between 732 and 735, when two monumental inscriptions were erected in the [[Orkhon Valley]] in honour of the [[G<U+00F6>kt<U+00FC>rks|G<U+00F6>kt<U+00FC>rk]] prince [[Kul Tigin]] and his brother Emperor [[Bilge Khan]]. After the discovery and excavation of the monuments and associated stone slabs in the wider area by [[Russia]]n archaeologists between 1889<U+2013>93, it became established that the language on the inscriptions was the [[Old Turkic language]] written using the [[Orkhon script]], which has also been referred to as "Turkic runes" or "runiform" due to an external similarity to the [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] [[runic alphabet]]s.<ref name="Ishjatms">Ishjatms</ref>

With the [[Turkic expansion]] during [[Early Middle Ages]] (c. [[6th century|6th]]<U+2013>[[11th century|11th centuries]]), peoples speaking Turkic languages spread across [[Central Asia]], covering a vast geographical region stretching from [[Siberia]] to [[Europe]] and the [[Mediterranean]]. The [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuqs]] of the [[Oghuz Turks]], in particular, brought their language, [[Oghuz languages|Oghuz Turkic]], the direct ancestor of today's Turkish language, into [[Anatolia]] during [[11th century]].<ref name="Findley">Findley</ref>

Also during the [[11th century]], an early [[linguist]] of the Turkic languages, [[Mahmud al-Kashgari|Ka<U+015F>garl<U+0131> Mahmud]] from the [[Kara-Khanid Khanate]], published the first comprehensive dictionary of Turkic languages, the ''Compendium of the Turkic Dialects'' (Ottoman Turkish: ''Div<U+00E2>n<U+00FC> L<U+00FC>gati't-T<U+00FC>rk''), which also included the first known map of the geographical distribution of Turkic speakers.<ref name="Soucek">Soucek</ref>

===Ottoman Turkish===
{{Main|Ottoman Turkish language}}
Following the adoption of [[Islam]] c. 950 by the [[Kara-Khanid Khanate]] and the [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuq Turks]], regarded as the cultural ancestors of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]], the administrative language of these states acquired a rather large collection of loanwords from [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Persian language|Persian]]. [[Turkish literature]] during the Ottoman period, in particular [[Ottoman poetry|Ottoman Divan poetry]], was heavily influenced by Persian, including the adoption of poetic meters and a great quantity of borrowings. During the course of over six hundred years of the [[Ottoman Empire]] (c. 1299<U+2013>1922), the literary and official language of the empire was a mixture of Turkish, Persian and Arabic, which differed considerably from everyday spoken Turkish of the time, and is termed [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]].

===Language reform and modern Turkish===
[[Image:Literacy-1924-Turkey.png|Literacy rates before the language reform in [[Turkey]] (1927). The literacy rates rose to 48.4% among males and 20.7% among females in 1950.<ref name=popindex>{{cite journal |last=Taeuber|first=Irene B.|year=1958|month=April|title=Population and Modernization in Turkey|journal=Population Index|volume=24|issue=2|pages=110|id={{OCLC|41483131}}|accessdate=2007-04-27|url=http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0032-4701%28195804%2924%3A2%3C101%3APAMIT%3E2.0.CO%3B2-Z|laysummary=http://www.jstor.org/journals/00324701.html|laysource=JSTOR}}</ref>|thumb|right|300px]]
After the foundation of the [[Republic of Turkey]], and following the [[#Writing system|script reform]], the [[Turkish Language Association]] (TDK) was established under the patronage of [[Mustafa Kemal Atat<U+00FC>rk]] in [[1932]], with the aim of conducting research on Turkish. One of the tasks of the newly established association was to initiate a [[language reform]] to replace loanwords of Arabic and Persian origin with Turkish equivalents.<ref>See Lewis (2002) for a thorough treatment of the Turkish language reform.</ref>  By banning the usage of replaced loanwords in the press, the association succeeded in removing several hundred foreign words from the language. While most of the words introduced to the language by the TDK were newly derived from [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] roots, it also opted for reviving Old Turkish words which had not been used for centuries.<ref name="TDK History"/>

Due to this sudden change in the language, older and younger people in Turkey started to differ in vocabularies they used. While the generations born before the [[1940s]] tend to use the older terms of Arabic or Persian origin, the younger generations favor new expressions.  It is particularly ironic that Atat<U+00FC>rk himself, in his [[Nutuk|monumental speech]] to the new [[Grand_National_Assembly_of_Turkey|Parliament]] in 1927, used a style of Ottoman diction which today sounds so alien that it has had to be "translated" twice into modern Turkish: first in 1963, then again in 1986.<ref>Lewis (2002): 2-3.</ref>  There is also a political dimension to the language debate, with conservative groups tending to use more archaic words in the press or everyday language.

The past few decades have seen the continuing work of the TDK to coin new Turkish words to express new concepts and technologies as they enter the language, mostly from [[English language|English]]. Many of these new words, particularly [[information technology]] terms, have received widespread acceptance, but the TDK is occasionally criticized for coining words which sound contrived and artificial. Some earlier coinages, too, such as ''betik'' (to replace ''kitap'', "book") or ''b<U+00F6>lem'' (to replace ''f<U+0131>rka'', "political party"),  failed to meet with popular approval.  In fact ''f<U+0131>rka'' has been replaced by the French loanword ''parti''.

Many of the words derived by TDK coexist with their older counterparts. This usually happens when a loanword changes its original meaning. For instance ''dert'', derived from the Persian word ''dard'' (<U+062F><U+0631><U+062F> "pain"), is used in Turkish to mean "problem" or "trouble"; whereas the native Turkish word ''a<U+011F>r<U+0131>'' is used for physical pain. Sometimes the loanword has a slightly different meaning from the native Turkish word, giving rise to a situation similar to the coexistence of [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] and [[Romance languages|Romance]] words in English (see [[List of Germanic and Latinate equivalents]]). Among some of the old words that were replaced are terms in [[geometry]], [[cardinal directions]], some months' names and many nouns and adjectives. Some examples of modern Turkish words and the old loanwords are:

Turkish is natively spoken by the [[Turkish people]] in Turkey and by the [[Turkish diaspora]] in some 30 other countries.

===Official status===
Turkish is the official language of [[Turkey]], and is one of the official languages of [[Cyprus]]. It also has official (but not primary) status in the [[Prizren District]] of [[Kosovo]] as well as several municipalities of [[Republic of Macedonia]], depending on the concentration of Turkish-speaking local population.

In Turkey, the regulatory body for Turkish is the [[Turkish Language Association]] (''T<U+00FC>rk Dil Kurumu'' or TDK), which was founded in 1932 under the name ''T<U+00FC>rk Dili Tetkik Cemiyeti'' ("Society for Research on the Turkish Language"). The Turkish Language Association was influenced by the [[linguistic purism]] ideology and one of its primary tasks was the replacement of loanwords and foreign grammatical constructions with equivalents of Turkish origin,<ref>The name TDK itself exemplifies this process.  The words ''tetkik'' and ''cemiyet'' in the original name are both Arabic loanwords (the final ''-i'' of ''cemiyeti'' being a Turkish possessive suffix); ''kurum'' is a native Turkish word based on the verb ''kurmak'', "set up, found".</ref> which, together with the adoption of the new [[Turkish alphabet]] in 1928, shaped the modern Turkish language spoken today (see [[#Language reform and modern Turkish|below]]). TDK became an independent body in 1951, with the lifting of the requirement that it should be presided over by the Minister of Education. This status continued until August, 1983, when it was again made into a governmental body in the [[Constitution of Turkey|constitution of 1982]] following the military [[1980 Turkish coup d'<U+00E9>tat|coup d'<U+00E9>tat of 1980]].<ref name="TDK History">{{cite web|author=Turkish Language Association|authorlink=Turkish Language Association|url=http://www.tdk.gov.tr/TR/BelgeGoster.aspx?F6E10F8892433CFFAAF6AA849816B2EF2858DA18F4388CDD|title=T<U+00FC>rk Dil Kurumu - Tarih<U+00E7>e (History of the Turkish Language Association)|accessdate=2007-03-18|}}{{tr icon}}</ref>

''K<U+0131>br<U+0131>s'' is the name for [[Cypriot Turkish]], and is spoken by the [[Turkish Cypriots]]. ''Edirne'' is the dialect of [[Edirne]]. ''Ege'' is spoken in the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] region, with its usage extending to [[Antalya]]. The nomadic [[Y<U+00F6>r<U+00FC>k]] tribes of the Mediterranean Region and the [[Balkan peninsula]] also have their own dialect of Turkish.

The phoneme {{IPA|/<U+0263>/}} usually referred to as ''yumu<U+015F>ak g'' ("soft g"), ''[[<U+011F>]]'' in Turkish [[orthography]], actually represents a rather weak front-velar or palatal approximant between front vowels. It never occurs at the beginning of a word, but always follows a vowel. When word-final or preceding another consonant, it lengthens the preceding vowel.<ref name="IPA 1999" />  

The sounds {{IPA|[c]}}, {{IPA|[<U+025F>]}} and {{IPA|[l]}} are in [[complementary distribution]] with {{IPA|[k]}}, {{IPA|[g]}} and {{IPA|[<U+026B>]}}, the former occurring with front vowels and the latter with back vowels.  These [[allophone]]s are not distinguished in the orthography, in which both series are written <k>, <g> and <l>.  When a vowel is added to nouns ending with postvocalic <k>, the <k> becomes <<U+011F>> by consonant [[alternation (linguistics)|alternation]].<ref>This rule does not apply to monosyllabic nouns. Lewis (2001):10.</ref>

===Vowels===
{| align="right"
!align="right"|IPA chart for Turkish vowels
|-
|[[Image:Turkish vowel chart.png]]
|}

The vowels of the [[Turkish]] language are, in their alphabetical order, ''a'', ''e'', [[Turkish dotted and dotless I|''<U+0131>'']], [[Turkish dotted and dotless I|''i'']], ''o'', ''<U+00F6>'', ''u'', ''<U+00FC>''. There are no [[diphthongs]] in Turkish and when two vowels come together, which occurs rarely and only with [[loanword]]s, each vowel retains its individual sound.

===Vowel harmony===
{{Details|Vowel harmony}}

The Turkish vowel system can be considered as being two-dimensional, where vowels are characterised by two features: [[Vowel backness|front/back]] and [[Roundedness|rounded/unrounded]].  Vowel harmony is the principle by which a native Turkish word incorporates either exclusively [[back vowel]]s (''a'', ''<U+0131>'', ''o'', ''u'') or exclusively [[front vowel]]s (''e'', ''i'', ''<U+00F6>'', ''<U+00FC>'').  The pattern of vowels is shown in the table below.<ref>Note that this table is essentially the same as the IPA vowel chart shown above: both table and chart indicate the physical location and quality of each vowel.</ref>

Grammatical [[affix]]es have "a [[chameleon]]-like quality"<ref>Lewis (1953):21</ref>, and obey one of the following patterns of vowel harmony:
*'''twofold (''-e/-a'')''':<ref>For the terms ''twofold'' and ''fourfold'', as well as the superscript notation, see Lewis (1953):21-22.  In his more recent works Lewis prefers to omit the superscripts, on the grounds that "there is no need for this once the principle has been grasped" (Lewis [2001]:18).</ref> the [[locative]] suffix, for example, is ''-de'' after front vowels and ''-da'' after back vowels.  The notation ''-de''<sup>2</sup> is a convenient shorthand for this pattern.
*'''fourfold (''-i/-<U+0131>/-<U+00FC>/-u'')''': the [[genitive]] suffix, for example, is ''-in'' or ''-<U+0131>n'' after unrounded vowels (front or back respectively); and ''-<U+00FC>n'' or ''-un'' after the corresponding rounded vowels.  In this case the shorthand notation ''-in''<sup>4</sup> is used.

The following examples, based on the [[Turkish copula|copula]] ''-dir''<sup>4</sup> ("[it] is"), illustrate the principles of vowel harmony in practice: ''T<U+00FC>rkiye''''dir''''' ("it is Turkey"), ''kap<U+0131>'''d<U+0131>r''''' ("it is the door"), but ''g<U+00FC>n'''d<U+00FC>r''''' ("it is the day"), ''palto'''dur''''' ("it is the coat").

There are some exceptions to the rules of vowel harmony.  In [[compound words]] the vowels need not harmonize between the constituent words of the compound (thus forms like ''bu''|''g<U+00FC>n'' ("today") or ''ba<U+015F>''|''kent'' ("capital") are permissible). In addition, vowel harmony does not apply in [[loanword]]s and some invariant affixes, such as ''-yor'' (present tense) and ''-bil-'' (potential).  Some loanwords do, however, exhibit partial or even complete vowel harmony (eg ''m<U+00FC>mk<U+00FC>n'' "possible" < Arabic ''mumkin''; and ''d<U+00FC>rb<U+00FC>n'' "binoculars" < Persian ''d<U+016B>rb<U+012B>n'').<ref>In Lewis's marvellously precise formulation, "The effect of vowel harmony extends to non-Turkish words too, bringing as many vowels as possible of a foreign borrowing into one class, or pressing a foreign borrowing whose vowels happen to be all of one class still further into Turkish form."  Lewis (2001): 17.</ref>  There are also a few native Turkish words that do not follow the rule, such as ''anne'' ("mother").  In such words<U+2014>and in loanwords as well<U+2014>suffixes harmonize with the ''final'' vowel: thus ''annedir'' ("she is a mother").  The [[#Geographic distribution|road sign in the photograph]] above illustrates all of these features:
*a native compound which does not obey vowel harmony: ''Orta|k<U+00F6>y'' ("middle village"<U+2014>a place name)
*a loanword also violating vowel harmony: ''viyad<U+00FC>k'' ("viaduct" < French ''viaduc'')
*the possessive suffix'' -i''<sup>4</sup> harmonizing with the final vowel (and softening the ''k'' by consonant alternation): ''viyad<U+00FC><U+011F><U+00FC>''

=== Stress ===
[[Stress (linguistics)|Stress]] is usually on the last syllable.<ref name="IPA 1999">''Handbook of the IPA'', p. 155</ref> Exceptions include some [[suffix]] combinations and [[loanword]]s, particularly from
[[Italian language|Italian]] and [[Modern Greek language|Greek]], as well as many proper names.  While such loanwords are usually stressed on the penultimate syllable (/<U+026B>o<U+02C8>kanta/ ''lokanta'' "restaurant" or /is<U+02C8>kele/ ''iskele'' "quay"), the stress of proper names is less predictable (/is<U+02C8>tanbu<U+026B>/ ''<U+0130>stanbul'',  /<U+02C8>a<U+014B>ka<U+027E>a/ ''Ankara'').

==Grammar==
{{main|Turkish grammar}}

Turkish is an [[agglutinative language]] and frequently uses [[affix]]es, or endings.<ref>This section draws heavily on Lewis (2001) and, to a lesser extent, Lewis (1953).  Only the most important references are specifically flagged with footnotes.</ref>  One word can have many affixes and these can also be used to create new words, such as creating a verb from a noun, or a noun from a verbal root (see the section on [[#Word formation|Word formation]]). Most affixes indicate the grammatical function of the word.<ref>see Lewis (2001) Ch XIV.</ref>
The only native [[prefix]]es are [[alliteration|alliterative]] intensifying syllables used with adjectives or adverbs: for example '''''s<U+0131>m'''s<U+0131>cak'' ("boiling hot" < ''s<U+0131>cak'') and '''''mas'''mavi'' ("bright blue" < ''mavi'').

The extensive use of affixes can give rise to long words. It is jokingly said that the longest Turkish word is ''<U+00C7>ekoslovakyal<U+0131>la<U+015F>t<U+0131>ramad<U+0131>klar<U+0131>m<U+0131>zdanm<U+0131><U+015F>s<U+0131>n<U+0131>z'', meaning "You must be one of those we couldn't turn into a Czechoslovak".  This example is of course contrived; but long words do frequently occur in normal Turkish, as in this heading of a newspaper obituary column: ''Bayramla<U+015F>amad<U+0131>klar<U+0131>m<U+0131>z'' (Bayram [festival]-Recipr-Impot-Partic-Plur-PossPl1; "Those of our number with whom we cannot exchange the season's greetings").<ref>This "splendid word" appeared at the time of ''Bayram'', the festival marking the end of the month of fasting.  Lewis (2001):287.</ref>  

=== Nouns ===
There is no [[definite article]] in Turkish.  Turkish nouns decline by taking case-endings, as in [[Latin]]. There are six [[Declension|noun cases]] in Turkish, with all the endings following vowel harmony (shown in the table using the shorthand [[#Vowel harmony|superscript notation]].  The plural marker ''-ler''<sup>2</sup> immediately follows the noun before any case or other affixes (eg ''k<U+00F6>ylerin'' "of the villages").

|''k<U+00F6>yde''

|in the village/on the tree
|}

The declension of ''a<U+011F>a<U+00E7>'' illustrates two important features of Turkish phonology: consonant [[assimilation (linguistics)|assimilation]] in [[suffix]]es (''a<U+011F>a<U+00E7>'''t'''an, a<U+011F>a<U+00E7>'''t'''a'') and [[voice (phonetics)|voicing]] of final consonants before vowels (''a<U+011F>a'''c'''<U+0131>n, a<U+011F>a'''c'''a, a<U+011F>a'''c'''<U+0131>'').

Additionally, nouns can take suffixes that assign [[grammatical person|person]]: for example ''-imiz''<sup>4</sup>, "our".  With the addition of the [[Turkish copula|copula]] (for example ''-im''<sup>4</sup>, "I am") complete sentences can be formed.  The [[interrogative word|interrogative]] particle ''mi''<sup>4</sup> immediately follows the word being questioned: ''k<U+00F6>ye mi?'' "[going] to the village?", ''a<U+011F>a<U+00E7> m<U+0131>?'' "[is it a] tree?".

|}

=== Adjectives ===
Turkish adjectives are not [[declension|declined]]. However most adjectives can also be used as nouns, in which case they are declined: e.g. ''g<U+00FC>zel'' ("beautiful") <U+2192> ''g<U+00FC>zeller'' ("(the) beautiful ones / people"). Used attributively, adjectives precede the nouns they modify. The adjectives ''var'' ("existent") and ''yok'' ("non-existent") are used in many cases where English would use "there is" or "have", ''e.g.'' ''s<U+00FC>t yok'' ("there is no milk", ''lit.'' "(the) milk (is) non-existent"); the construction "''noun 1''-GEN ''noun 2''-POSS var/yok" can be translated "''noun 1'' has/doesn't have ''noun 2''"; ''imparatorun elbisesi yok'' "the emperor has no clothes" ("(the) emperor-''of'' clothes-''his'' non-existent"); ''kedimin ayakkab<U+0131>lar<U+0131> yoktu'' ("my cat had no shoes", ''lit.'' "cat-''my''-''of'' shoe-''plur.''-''its'' non-existent-''past tense''").

The Turkish [[personal pronouns]] in the nominative case are ''ben'' (1s), ''sen'' (2s), o (3s), biz (1pl), siz (2pl, or formal/polite 2s), and onlar (3pl). They are declined regularly with some exceptions: ''benim'' (1s gen.); ''bizim'' (1pl gen.); ''bana'' (1s dat.); ''sana'' (2s dat.); and the oblique forms of ''o'' use the root ''on''.  All other pronouns (reflexive ''kendi'' and so on) are declined regularly.

===Verbs===
{{seealso|Turkish copula}}
Turkish verbs indicate [[Grammatical person|person]]. They can be made negative, potential ("can") or impotential ("cannot"). Furthermore, Turkish verbs show [[Grammatical tense|tense]] ([[Present tense|present]], [[Past tense|past]], [[Grammatical mood#Inferential|inferential]], [[Future tense|future]], and [[aorist]]), [[Grammatical mood|mood]] ([[Conditional mood|conditional]], [[Imperative mood|imperative]], necessitative, and [[Optative mood|optative]]), and [[Grammatical aspect|aspect]].  Negation is expressed by the [[infix]] ''-me<sup>2</sup>-'' immediately following the stem.

{|class = "wikitable"
|-
!Turkish
!English
|-
|''gel-''
|align="right"|(to) come
|-
|''gelebil-''
|align="right"|(to) be able to come
|-
|''gelme-''
|align="right"|not (to) come
|-
|''geleme-''
|align="right"|(to) be unable to come
|-
|''gelememi<U+015F>''
|align="right"|I gather (s)he couldn't come
|-
|''gelebilecek''
|align="right"|(s)he'll be able to come
|-
|''gelebilirsen''
|align="right"|if you can come
|-
|''gelinir''
|align="right"|(passive) one comes, people come
|}

All Turkish verbs are conjugated in the same way, except for the irregular and [[defective verb]] ''i-'', the [[Turkish copula]], which can be used in compound forms (the shortened form is called an [[enclitic]]): ''Gelememi<U+015F>ti'' = ''Gelememi<U+015F> idi'' = ''Gelememi<U+015F> + i- + -di''

=== Participles ===
Turkish has several [[participle]]s, including present (with the ending ''-en''<sup>2</sup>), future (''-ecek''<sup>2</sup>), past (''-mi<U+015F>''<sup>4</sup>) and [[aorist]] (-''er''<sup>2</sup> or -''ir''<sup>4</sup>).  These forms can function as either adjectives or nouns: ''oynamayan <U+00E7>ocuklar'' "children who do not play", ''oynamayanlar'' "those who do not play"; ''okur yazar'' "reader-writer = literate", ''okur yazarlar'' "literates".  

The most important function of participles is to form modifying phrases equivalent to the [[relative clause]]s found in most European languages.  The participles used in these constructions are the future (''-ecek''<sup>2</sup>) and an older form (-''dik''<sup>4</sup>), which covers both present and past meanings.<ref>See Lewis (2001):163-165, 260-262 for an exhaustive treatment.</ref>  The use of these "personal" or "relative" participles is illustrated in the following table, in which the examples are presented according to the grammatical case which would be seen in the equivalent English relative clause.<ref>For the terms ''personal'' and ''relative'' participle see Lewis (1958):98 and Lewis (2001):163 respectively.  Most of the examples are taken from Lewis (2001).</ref>

===Word order===
Word order in simple sentences in Turkish is generally [[Subject Object Verb]], as in [[Japanese (language)|Japanese]] and [[Latin]], but not [[English language|English]]. In more complex sentences the basic rule is that the qualifier precedes the qualified: this principle includes, as an important special case, the [[#Participles|participial modifiers]] discussed above.  The definite precedes the indefinite: thus ''<U+00E7>ocu<U+011F>a hik<U+00E2>yeyi anlatt<U+0131>'' "she told the child the story", but ''hik<U+00E2>yeyi bir <U+00E7>ocu<U+011F>a anlatt<U+0131>'' "she told the story to a child".<ref>Lewis (2001): 239-240.</ref>

It is possible to alter the word order to stress the importance of a certain word or phrase. The main rule is that the word before the verb has the stress without exception. For example, if one wants to say "Hakan went to school" with a stress on the word "school" (''okul'', the indirect object) it would be "Hakan ''okula'' gitti". If the stress is to be placed on "Hakan" (the subject), it would be "Okula ''Hakan'' gitti" which means "it's Hakan who went to school".

=== Word formation ===
Turkish extensively uses [[agglutination]] to [[Word formation|form new words]] from nouns and verbal stems. The majority of Turkish words originate from the application of derivative suffixes to a relatively small set of core vocabulary.

==Writing system==
[[Image:LIllustrationCover13October1928.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Mustafa Kemal Atat<U+00FC>rk|Atat<U+00FC>rk]] introducing the new [[Turkish alphabet]] to the people of [[Sivas]]. September 20, 1928. (Cover of the French ''L'Illustration'' magazine)]]
{{mainarticle|Turkish alphabet}}
Turkish is written using a [[Turkish alphabet|modified version]] of the [[Latin alphabet]] introduced in 1928 by [[Mustafa Kemal Atat<U+00FC>rk|Atat<U+00FC>rk]] to replace the [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]]-based [[Ottoman Turkish alphabet]].   
The Ottoman alphabet marked only three different vowels<U+2014>long ''<U+0101>, <U+016B>'' and ''<U+012B>''<U+2014>and included several redundant consonants such as variants of ''z'' (which were distinguished in Arabic but not in Turkish). The omission of short vowels in the Arabic script made it particularly unsuitable for Turkish, which has [[#Vowel harmony|eight vowels]].

The reform of the script was an important step in the [[Atat<U+00FC>rk's Reforms|cultural reforms]] of the period. The task of preparing the new alphabet and selecting the necessary modifications for sounds specific to Turkish was entrusted to a [[Turkish alphabet#Modern Turkish alphabet|Language Commission]] composed of prominent linguists, academics and writers.  The introduction of the new Turkish alphabet was supported by public education centers opened throughout the country, cooperation with publishing companies, and encouragement by Atat<U+00FC>rk himself, who toured the country teaching the new letters to the public.<ref name="Dilacar">{{cite journal|last=Dila<U+00E7>ar|first=Agop|authorlink=Agop Dila<U+00E7>ar|title=Atat<U+00FC>rk ve Yaz<U+0131>m|journal=T<U+00FC>rk Dili|issn= 1301-465X|volume=35|issue=307|url= http://www.dildernegi.org.tr/TR/BelgeGoster.aspx?F6E10F8892433CFFAAF6AA849816B2EFC3C6D81741DBEB05|accessdate=2007-03-19|year=1977}}{{tr icon}}</ref>
There was a dramatic increase in literacy from its original Third World levels.<ref>Coulmas, pp. 243-244</ref> 

Turkish now has an alphabet suited to the sounds of the language: the spelling is largely [[Phonetic spelling|phonetic]], with one letter corresponding to each [[phoneme]].  Most of the letters are used approximately as in English, the main exceptions being <c>, which denotes {{IPA|[d<U+0292>]}}, as in the English word '''''j'''ail'', and the undotted <<U+0131>>, representing the close back unrounded vowel {{IPA|[<U+026F>]}}.<ref>"Americans will recognize in it the first vowel of ''M'''i'''ssouri'' as pronounced by a native of that state."  Lewis (2001):13. </ref>  The letter <<U+011F>> in principle denotes {{IPA|[<U+0263>]}}, but has the property of lengthening the preceding vowel and assimilating any subsequent vowel (eg ''so<U+011F>uk'' "cold" is pronounced {{IPA|[souk]}}).  The letters <<U+015F>> and <<U+00E7>> represent {{IPA|[<U+0283>]}} and {{IPA|[t<U+0283>]}} respectively, as in English '''''sh'''all'' and '''''ch'''ill''.
