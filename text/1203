'''Daryl Hall''' (born  October 11, 1946) is an [[United States|American]] [[Rock music|rock]], [[R&B]] and [[Soul music|soul]] singer, [[keyboardist]], [[guitarist]], [[songwriter]] and [[music producer|producer]], best known as the co-founder and lead vocalist of [[Hall & Oates]] (with co-founder/guitarist/songwriter [[John Oates]]).  Hall scored several Billboard chart hits in the 1970s and early 1980s, and is regarded as one of the best soul singers of his generation.<ref>Bogdanov, Vladimir (editor). (2003) ''All music guide to soul: the definitive guide to R&B and soul'' Hal Leonard Corporation, ISBN 978-0-87930-744-8, p. 292.</ref> Guitarist [[Robert Fripp]],<ref>Fripp, Robert. Notes for ''Exposure'' 2006 two-CD reissue.</ref> who collaborated with him in the late 1970s and early 1980s, has written, "Daryl's pipes were a wonder. I have never worked with a more able singer." Since late 2007, he has hosted the [[web television]] series, ''Live From Daryl's House''. He was inducted into the [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]] in 2004.<ref>[http://songwritershalloffame.org/exhibits/C335 Daryl Hall at the Songwriters Hall of Fame]</ref>

==Early life and career==
'''Daryl Franklin Hohl''' was born in [[Pottstown, Pennsylvania|Pottstown]], a [[Pennsylvania]] borough {{Convert|40|mi}} from [[Philadelphia]].  He started a recording career during and after attending [[Owen J. Roberts School District|Owen J. Roberts High School]], from which he graduated in 1965 and entered Philadelphia's [[Temple University]], majoring in music, while working with [[Kenny Gamble]] and [[Leon Huff]] as both an artist and session musician.  Pursuing his goals in the big city, Hall quickly formed creative affiliations with such artists as [[Smokey Robinson]], the [[Temptations]] and many other top soul singers of the 1960s.

In 1967, he met [[John Oates]], also a college student from Temple, and embarked on a 40-odd year creative journey. According to Daryl Hall they met when, "We got in the middle of a fight at a dance - I have no idea what the fight was about. I guess the Greek letters on one gang's jackets didn't appeal to the other gang. We both beat it out the back and met on the elevator while leaving the place rather quickly." Hall was already a senior, while Oates was a freshman, and both had played it out temporarily, until Oates transferred schools, at only 19. Daryl did not let this discourage his musical career as he worked with [[Tim Moore]] in a short-lived rock band Gulliver and released one album on [[Elektra Records]]. By 1969, just one year after his dropout from college, Hall went back to concentrating on recording other artists, which led them into signing their very first record contract, early in 1972.

==Hall & Oates==
{{Main|Hall & Oates}}
Signed to [[Atlantic Records|Atlantic]] by [[Ahmet Ertegun]] and managed by [[Tommy Mottola]] in the early 1970s, [[Hall & Oates]] have sold more albums than any other duo in music history. Their second album, ''[[Abandoned Luncheonette]]'', produced by [[Arif Mardin]] and released in 1973, yielded the single, "She's Gone", which went to No.&nbsp;7 in the U.S. Top 10 on re-release in 1976 after reaching No.&nbsp;1 on the R&B charts when it was covered by [[Tavares (group)|Tavares]]. The duo recorded one more album with Atlantic, ''[[War Babies (Hall & Oates album)|War Babies]]'' (produced by [[Todd Rundgren]]), before they were dropped and promptly signed to [[RCA]]. During their tenure at RCA the duo catapulted to international superstardom.

From the mid-1970s to the mid-1980s, Hall & Oates scored six U.S. No.&nbsp;1 singles, including "[[Rich Girl (Hall & Oates song)|Rich Girl]]" (also No.&nbsp;1 R&B), "[[Kiss on My List]]", "[[Private Eyes (song)|Private Eyes]]", "[[I Can't Go for That (No Can Do)]]" (also No.&nbsp;1 R&B), "[[Maneater (Hall & Oates song)|Maneater]]" and "[[Out of Touch]]" from their six multi-platinum albums - ''[[Bigger Than Both of Us]]'', ''[[Voices (Hall & Oates album)|Voices]]'', ''[[Private Eyes (Hall & Oates album)|Private Eyes]]'', ''[[H2O (Hall & Oates album)|H2O]]'', ''[[Rock 'n Soul Part 1]]'' and ''[[Big Bam Boom]]'' - the last five of which were released consecutively. The era also produced an additional five U.S. Top 10 singles, "Sara Smile", "[[One on One (song)|One on One]]", "[[Family Man (song)|Family Man]]," "You Make My Dreams", "[[Say It Isn't So (Hall & Oates song)|Say It Isn't So]]" and "[[Method of Modern Love]]".

==Solo projects==
In addition to his work with Oates, Hall has made music as a solo artist as well as recording with [[Robert Fripp]] in the late <U+2018>70s, working on Fripp<U+2019>s critically praised, ''[[Exposure (Robert Fripp album)|Exposure]]'' album from 1979. In 1977 Fripp produced and performed on Hall's debut solo album, the much-acclaimed ''[[Sacred Songs]]''. This album was released in 1980.

In 1984, he co-wrote and produced, with [[Arthur Baker (musician)|Arthur Baker]], the single ''[[Swept Away (Diana Ross song)|Swept Away]]'' for [[Diana Ross]], which reached US No.&nbsp;19, US R & B No.&nbsp;3 and US Dance/Club Play No.&nbsp;1.

In 1985, Hall performed two songs in the first [[Farm Aid]] concert in [[Champaign, Illinois]].<ref>[http://blog.farmaid.org/2011/06/farm-aid-music-monday-starring-daryl.html Farm Aid Website]</ref> Hall participated in the [[We Are the World]] session as well as closing the [[Live Aid]] show in Philadelphia. He also made an album with [[David A. Stewart|Dave Stewart]] that year, ''[[Three Hearts in the Happy Ending Machine]]''. He has recorded such solo works as ''[[Soul Alone]]'' in 1993 and ''[[Can't Stop Dreaming]]'' in 1996, both of which were received well internationally. In 1994 composed "Gloryland" that was the Original Soundtrack of the [[1994 FIFA World Cup]].

In July 2005, Hall was diagnosed with [[Lyme Disease]] causing him to cancel a majority of Hall & Oates' summer tour.  The duo released a Christmas album in October 2006 titled ''[[Home for Christmas (Hall & Oates album)|Home for Christmas]]''.

In 2007, Hall guest starred on the [[HBO]] series ''[[Flight of the Conchords (TV series)|Flight of the Conchords]]'', portraying an MC of a world music fest.

On November 14, 2007, Hall appeared on the ''[[Howard Stern Show]]'', discussed his hatred of deer and rabbits, prompted by his career-threatening bout with Lyme Disease, sang acoustic versions of "Sara Smile' and "Rich Girl", and talked about his new monthly performance webcast called "Live from Daryl's House". The webcast has so far featured appearances by [[KT Tunstall]],Rob Thomas, Eric Hutchinson, and [[Gym Class Heroes]]' [[Travis McCoy]], as well as a holiday special featuring songs from the Hall and Oates release, ''Home for Christmas''. The show featured guests [[Ray Manzarek]] and [[Robbie Krieger]] of [[The Doors]].

Speaking of his reasons for starting the ''Live From Daryl's House'' webcast, in June 2008 Hall told noted UK R&B writer Pete Lewis of the award-winning [[Blues & Soul]]: "For me it was sort of an obvious thing. I've been touring my whole adult life really, and, you know, you can't be EVERYWHERE! Nor do I WANT to be everywhere at this point! I only like to spend so much time per year on the road. So I thought 'Why don't I just do something where anyone who wants to see me anywhere in the world CAN?! And, instead of doing the artist/audience performance-type thing, I wanted to deconstruct it and make the audience more of a fly-on-the-wall kind of observer... I mean, what I've always done onstage is very natural. I talk to the audience and it's a very sitting-roomy kind of thing. So I just thought I'd basically bring that to the web."<ref>[http://www.bluesandsoul.com/feature/304/hall_or_nothing/ Daryl Hall interview by Pete Lewis, 'Blues & Soul' July 2008]</ref>

On March 12, 2008, Hall played a well-received set with his band at the [[South by Southwest]] festival in [[Austin, Texas]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.howardstern.com/rundown.hs?d=1195016400# |title=Hall and no oates - The Howard Stern Show |publisher=Howardstern.com |date=2007-11-14 |accessdate=2011-11-25}}</ref>

Hall was slated to sing the [[National Anthem of the United States|National Anthem]] before Game 5 of the [[2008 World Series]] at Philadelphia's [[Citizens Bank Park]] but, due to an illness, could not appear, and Oates filled in for him.<ref>{{cite web

In 2009, Hall guest starred on the [[Independent Film Channel]] series, ''[[Z Rock (TV series)|Z-Rock]]'' (as himself).

In 2010 Hall was back in the studio working on a solo recording with bassist and musical director, [[Tom Wolk|T-Bone Wolk]]. Wolk died of a heart attack on February 28, 2010, hours after completing a session with Hall. Hall released a statement about the death of his bassist of nearly 30 years: <U+201C>It<U+2019>s not if I will go on, but how? T-Bone was one of the most sensitive and good human beings that I have ever known.<U+201D><ref>{{cite web|url=http://entertainment.gaeatimes.com/2010/03/01/tom-t-bone-wolk-longtime-bass-player-for-hall-oates-dies-of-heart-attack-at-58-95478/ |title=Tom <U+2018>T-Bone<U+2019> Wolk, longtime bass player for Hall & Oates, dies of heart attack at 58 |publisher=Blog.taragana.com |date=2010-03-01 |accessdate=2011-11-25}}</ref>

On June 11, 2010 Hall shared the stage with electronic duo [[Chromeo]] for a special late night set at the [[Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival]]. The groups had previously collaborated in a 2008 episode of ''Live from Daryl's House''. Their [[Bonnaroo]] set consisted of a mix of both [[Hall & Oates]] and Chromeo tracks with the encore featuring [[Fancy Footwork]] and [[You Make My Dreams]].

Hall hosted [[WGN America]]'s 2010 [[New Year's Eve]] coverage as a ''Live from Daryl's House'' special. The special featured clips of previous ''Live from Daryl's House'' episodes. [[Steve Dahl]], a Chicago radio host, praised the special as the best New Year's Eve special on television for 2010<U+2013>11, but criticized the show's lack of a live countdown to midnight.<ref>[http://www.dahl.com/blog/feeling-my-nye-hall-and-oates ]{{dead link|date=November 2011}}</ref>

On September 27, 2011 Daryl Hall released "Laughing Down Crying" on Verve Records.

In August 12, 2011 UK [[Electronic music|Electronic]] duo [[Nero (band)|Nero]] released their debut album "[[Welcome Reality]]", which features guest vocals by Hall on the track "Reaching Out", which also samples [[Hall & Oates]]' 80's hit [[Out of Touch]]. [[Reaching Out (Nero song)|Reaching Out]] was released as the sixth single on December 6, 2011.
