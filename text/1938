'''''Eriocampa tulameenensis''''' is an extinct [[species]] of [[sawfly]] in the family [[Tenthredinidae]] that is known from early to early middle [[Eocene]] lake deposits near the small community of [[Princeton, British Columbia]] in the [[Similkameen Country|Similkameen region]].<ref name=Rice1968>{{Cite journal |author=Rice, H.M.A. |title=Two Tertiary sawflies, (Hymenoptera - Tenthredinidae), from British Columbia |journal=Geological Survey of Canada |year=1968 |volume=67 |issue=59 |pages=1<U+2013>21}}</ref>

==History and classification==
''Eriocampa tulameenensis'' is known only from one fossil, the [[holotype]], number "GSC No. 22688". It is a  a single, mostly complete adult of undetermined sex, preserved as a compression fossil in fine grained [[shale]].<ref name=Rice1968/>  The [[shale]] specimen is from deposits along the [[Canadian Pacific Railway|Canadian Pacific rail line]] in the Similkameen Country of [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]].  The type specimen is currently preserved in the [[Geological Survey of Canada|Geological Survey of Canada paleoentomological collections]] in [[Ottawa, Ontario]], Canada.  ''E.  tulameenensis'' was first studied by [[Harington Molesworth Anthony Rice|Dr Harington M. A. Rice]] of the Geological Survey of Canada, with his 1968 [[Type (biology)|type description]] being published in the the Geological Survey of Canada professional paper number 67-59.<ref name=Rice1968/>  The [[species|specific epithet]] ''tulameenensis'' was coined in reference to the [[Tulameen River]] near where the fossil was collected in 1957.<ref name=Rice1968/> 

''Eriocampa tulameenensis'' is the largest species of ''[[Eriocampa]]'' to be described in the type paper, though the dismembered condition of the body made measurement unpractical.  Due to the preservation condition Harington M. A. Rice noted the assignment of the species to ''Eriocampa'' as tentative and based on the similarities of the fore wing to other members of the genus. The single known specimen possesses a head, part of the thorax and posterior areas of the abdomen which are dark brown to black.  Where they are visible the [[antennae]] are filiform and brown to dark brown.  The central segments of he abdomen appear to have been pale colored. The well preserved wings are hyaline with dark brown to dark amber veins.  Unfortunately the specimen is missing portions of its legs and antennae.  ''E. tulameenensis'' is distinguished from members of the related genus ''[[Pseudosiobla]]'' in general and ''[[Pseudosiobla campbelli|P. campbelli]]'' found in the related lake deposits near [[Horsefly, British Columbia]] by several features, ''E. tulameenensis'' is notably smaller than members of ''Pseudosiobla'' and the fore wing vein patterning is distinct.<ref name=Rice1968/>

There are six other described species of ''Eriocampa'' from the fossil record, ''[[Eriocampa bruesi|E. bruesi]]'', ''[[Eriocampa celata|E. celata]]'', ''[[Eriocampa pristina|E. pristina]]'',  ''[[Eriocampa scudderi|E. scudderi]]'', ''[[Eriocampa synthetica|E. synthetica]]'',  and ''[[Eriocampa wheeleri|E. wheeleri]]''.  All are described and known only from specimens found in the younger [[Florissant Formation]] of [[Colorado]] which, at 39 million years old, is younger in age then the Princeton locality, dated to approximately 49 million years old.  ''E. tulameenensis'' can be distinguished from all the younger species in that ''E. tulameenensis'' is the largest species of the seven.<ref name=Rice1968/>
