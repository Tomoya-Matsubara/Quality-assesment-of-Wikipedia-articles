'''Claudia Ciesla''' (born [[February 12]], [[1987]], in [[Loslau]]/[[Silesia]], Poland) is a [[model (person)|model]]. She grew up in the little town of Bukow, Poland, 5 miles from the Czech border in an area called [[Silesia]] with a minority German population (before 1945 it was a German territory). Her father is Polish and her mother is German.<ref name="cc">[http://www.cclaudia.com Personal web page]</ref>

Ciesla started modeling at the age of 15 working for shows involved in fashion and dancing. At the age of 17 she moved to Germany and became an Internet glamour model. Her original stage name is "CClaudia", but she also appears frequently under her real name. Her first major Internet publication{{Fact|date=July 2007}} was in ''[[BrianX]]'' magazine in early 2005.<ref name="bx">[http://brianx.com/model-cclaudia.html CClaudia -Featured Model]</ref>

She then appeared in print in the German ''Matador'' magazine.  She was discovered by the former German ''[[Playboy]]'' Chief Editor, Stefan Gessulat, and appeared in the August 2005 ''Matador'' issue (over 10 pages) as Miss Matador. This was her first time posing for a very aesthetic and tasteful topless shoot. After this, she has received numerous offers from many photographers and magazines for this kind of work but she always refused to do nude or topless modeling, except one shoot for newspaper ''[[Bild]]''.

She has also done many glamorous bikini style modeling shoots and her career has snowballed; she is now known and published on hundreds of Internet websites. She has  many internet fan groups like her U.S. fan group.

Much discussion has taken place over the internet to the nature of her breasts. The German newspaper ''Bild'' became interested and arranged for CClaudia to see Dr. Bruckner (one of Germany's best known doctors) at his Beauty Surgery Clinique in Nuremberg, and CClaudia was examined by Dr. Bruckner personally.
There was a big report in ''Bild'' to state that no implants existed and that her breasts were entirely natural.{{Fact|date=July 2007}}

In March 2006, Ciesla won a subscribers poll on the internet websites of ''[[Auto Bild]]'', ''Bild'', [[SAT1]] and Kabeleins and she obtained the most votes with a big lead over her rivals with 400,000 hits to her profile to give her first place as Germany's Super Girl 2006.  In May 2006 she was selected by ''Bild'' as the Football/Soccer Worldcup Girl 2006, and during the World Cup 2006 she was featured on the front page of a total of seven publications of that newspaper.<ref name="mm">[http://modelmayhem.com/member.php?id=30096 Model Mayhem profile]</ref>
