Sports|publisher=[[Canadian Online Explorer]]}}</ref> is an [[Ireland|Irish]] [[Professional wrestling|professional wrestler]], best known by his [[ring name]]s '''Sheamus O'Shaunessy''' and '''Sheamus'''. He is currently contracted to [[World Wrestling Entertainment]] (WWE), where he is competing on its [[WWE Raw|Raw]] brand, as well as WWE's [[Farm team#Professional wrestling|developmental territory]] [[Florida Championship Wrestling]] (FCW).

Prior to joining WWE, Farrelly was also a two-time [[Irish Whip Wrestling#Irish Whip Wrestling International Heavyweight Championship|International Heavyweight Champion]] during his tenure in [[Irish Whip Wrestling]]. During his time in FCW, he held the [[Florida Championship Wrestling#FCW Florida Heavyweight Championship|FCW Florida Heavyweight Championship]] once.

==Professional wrestling career==
===Irish and British promotions (2002<U+2013>2007)===
Farrelly began his career by training in [[Larry Sharpe]]'s Monster Factory wrestling school. He officially debuted six days after completing his training and wrestled as a [[Face (professional wrestling)|fan favorite]] under the name Sheamus O'Shaunessy. A serious neck injury, however, sidetracked his career for two years.<ref name="slam"/>

In May 2004, still using the ring name Sheamus O'Shaunessy, Farrelly returned to wrestling at the newly opened [[Irish Whip Wrestling]] school in [[Dublin]]. He then made his debut match for the [[Professional wrestling promotion|promotion]] at their [[Mount Temple, County Westmeath|Mount Temple]] show on July 9 against Mark Burns, who he [[Squash (professional wrestling)|squashed]]. He then went on to wrestle and defeat several international wrestlers, including Vid Vain, [[Matthew Kaye|Matt Striker]], [[John Jirus|Xavier]], and [[Mikey Batts]]. In March 2005, he defeated Vid Vain, [[Darren Burridge]], and former ally Red Vinny to become the IwW's first ever International Champion. O'Shaunessy later began a [[Feud (professional wrestling)|scripted rivalry]] with Burridge for the title. During a title defense against [[D'Lo Brown]], Burridge hit him in the head with a baton, thus costing O'Shaunessy the match and his title. O'Shaunessy and Burridge finally squared off in a grudge match, which saw O'Shaunessy successfully exact his revenge and win the match. He then set his sights on winning his championship back and defeated both Red Vinny and Vic Viper to become a participant in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic non-elimination matches|triple threat match]] for the International title against D'Lo Brown and The Assassin at a show in [[Newcastle West|Newcastle]] in October. O'Shaunessy pinned Brown to win the match and his second International title. He then successfully defended his title against [[Vampiro]] in late 2005.

On October 21, 2006, O'Shaunessy officially became a [[Heel (professional wrestling)|villain]] at No Limit Wrestling's ''Halloween Slam'' event. He defeated Vampiro once again to retain the title on [[Saint Patrick's Day]] in 2006. Farrelly then begun wrestling predominately for [[All Star Wrestling]].<ref name="slam"/> While he was unsuccessful in his bid for the [[British Heavyweight Championship|ASW British Heavyweight Championship]], he vowed to continue his hunt for the title, but he later left ASW to wrestle for Real Quality Wrestling (RQW). On March 24, 2007, O'Shaunessy debuted for RQW by defeating [[Stu Sanders]]. He then went on to have a popular feud with [[Drew Galloway]], which resulted in their first match against each other on April 20 that ended in a double countout. On June 16, both men faced off for the second time, this time in a [[Professional wrestling match types#No Disqualification match|No Holds Barred match]], in which Galloway came out as the winner. Soon afterward, O'Shaunessy left RQW.

===World Wrestling Entertainment (2006<U+2013>present)===
In November 2006, O'Shaunessy appeared at the televised [[WWE Raw|Raw]] show in the M.E.N. Arena in [[Manchester]], [[England]] as a member of [[World Wrestling Entertainment]] (WWE)'s security team.<ref name="slam"/> His role was to eject [[D-Generation X]] (DX) from ringside. After escorting them from ringside, DX later attacked [[Rated-RKO]] after their match, resulting in O'Shaunessy and the rest of the security team coming down to the ring to break up the fight. O'Shaunessy and the security team were attacked by DX. O'Shaunessy was the last security guard standing and he received a [[Facebuster#Double underhook facebuster|Pedigree]] from [[Triple H]] as a result of his interjection. O'Shaunessy also had a tryout with WWE in November, around the time of a Dublin house show. In April 2007, O'Shaunessy was called upon by WWE once again for another tryout, which became a [[List of professional wrestling terms#D|dark match]] against [[James Yun|Jimmy Wang Yang]] in the Datch Forum in Milan before a ''[[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown!]]'' taping.

====Florida Championship Wrestling (2007<U+2013>2009)====
The following week in the Earls Court, O'Shaunessy was once again back at a WWE house show, where more tryouts were held. This time, however, he was signed to a developmental contract. After receiving his contract, he was placed in WWE's newest [[Farm team#Professional wrestling|developmental territory]], [[Florida Championship Wrestling]] (FCW). On February 19, 2008, O'Shaunessy teamed up with the debuting [[Kafu]] and were joined by [[Dave Taylor (wrestler)|Dave Taylor]] as they took part in a tag team tournament to crown the first-ever holders of the [[FCW Florida Tag Team Championship]].

On July 22, O'Shaunessy worked a dark match at the SmackDown / [[ECW (WWE)|ECW]] tapings, losing to [[Ron Killings]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.f4wonline.com/content/view/6106/105/|title=Smackdown spoilers from Philadelphia|date=2008-07-22|last=Begley|first=Ray|accessdate=2008-10-25|publisher=Wrestling Observer/Figure Four Online}}</ref>
