The '''Fiume Krone''' ({{lang-it|corona Fiumana}}, abbreviated '''Cor.''' or '''FIUK''') was introduced in the [[Free State of Fiume]] on 18 April 1919 by the stamping the previous [[Austro-Hungarian krone]] notes by the [[Italian National Council of Fiume]] who effectively exercised power in the City. After the Dannunzian occupation in September 1919, a new series of notes were stamped on behalf of the ''Istituto di credito del Consiglio Nazionale'' with a decree dated 6 October 1919. The Fiume Krone was the official currency of the City of [[Fiume]] up to 26 September 1920 when, by the decree of the general Amantea commander of the Italian troops in Fiume, the [[Italian lira]] was introduced as the new official currency.<ref>Julijan Dobrini<U+0107>, ''Rije<U+010D>ka numizmatika - Rije<U+010D>ki novci i novci s rije<U+010D>kim obilje<U+017E>jima 1848.-2002.'', Muzej grada Rijeke, 2005, pp. 74-79</ref>
The currency continued to circulate until the annexation of the city to Italy in February 1924. The royal decree n 235 of the 24th February 1924 set the final conversion date on April the 30th 1924 at 0.40 [[Italian lira]] for one Corona Fiumana<ref>Giuseppe Sirsen, "Fiume e la numismatica", ''Fiume'', (7) 1984, p. 84.</ref>.
