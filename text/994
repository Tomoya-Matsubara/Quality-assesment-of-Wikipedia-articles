{{Pedro II of Brazil}}

[[Dom (title)|Dom]] '''Pedro&nbsp;II''' (English: Peter''&nbsp;''II; 2 December 1825 &ndash; 5 December 1891), nicknamed "the [[Magnanimity|Magnanimous]]",{{sfn|Barman|1999|p=85}} was the [[List of monarchs of Brazil|second and last]] ruler of the [[Empire of Brazil]], reigning for over 58 years.{{efn-ua|"The Second Reign, that is, the period in which our Emperor was D. Pedro&nbsp;II, lasted fifty-eight years, from the abdication of his father, D. Pedro&nbsp;I, in 1831, until the proclamation of the republic in 1889."&nbsp;<U+2014>H<U+00E9>lio Viana in {{harvnb|Viana|1994|p=467}}}} Born in [[Rio de Janeiro]], he was the seventh child of Emperor Dom [[Pedro&nbsp;I of Brazil]] and Empress Dona [[Maria Leopoldina of Austria|Maria Leopoldina]] and thus a member of the Brazilian branch of the [[House of Braganza]]. His father's abrupt abdication and flight to Europe in 1831 left a five-year-old Pedro&nbsp;II as Emperor and led to a grim and lonely childhood and adolescence. Obliged to spend his time studying in preparation for rule, he knew only brief moments of happiness and encountered few friends of his age. His experiences with court intrigues and political disputes during this period greatly affected his later character. Pedro&nbsp;II grew into a man with a strong sense of duty and devotion toward his country and his people. On the other hand, he increasingly resented his role as monarch.

Inheriting an Empire on the verge of disintegration, Pedro&nbsp;II turned [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]-speaking [[Brazil]] into an emerging power in the international arena. The nation grew to be distinguished from its [[Hispanic America|Hispanic neighbors]] on account of its political stability, zealously guarded freedom of speech, respect for civil rights, vibrant economic growth and especially for its form of government: a functional, [[Constitutional monarchy|representative parliamentary monarchy]]. Brazil was also victorious in three international conflicts (the [[Platine War]], the [[Uruguayan War]] and the [[Paraguayan War]]) under his rule, as well as prevailing in several other international disputes and domestic tensions. Pedro&nbsp;II steadfastly pushed through the abolition of slavery despite opposition from powerful political and economic interests. A savant in his own right, the Emperor established a reputation as a vigorous sponsor of learning, culture and the sciences. He won the respect and admiration of scholars such as [[Charles Darwin]], [[Victor Hugo]] and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], and was a friend to [[Richard Wagner]], [[Louis Pasteur]] and [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]], among others.

Although there was no desire for a change in the form of government among most [[Brazilian people|Brazilians]], the Emperor was overthrown in a sudden coup d'<U+00E9>tat that had almost no support outside a clique of military leaders who desired a form of [[republic]] headed by a [[Dictatorship|dictator]]. Pedro&nbsp;II had become weary of emperorship and despaired over the monarchy's future prospects, despite its overwhelming popular support. He allowed no prevention of his ouster and did not support any attempt to restore the monarchy. He spent the last two years of his life in exile in Europe, living alone on very little money.

The reign of Pedro&nbsp;II thus came to an unusual end<U+2014>he was overthrown while highly regarded by the people and at the pinnacle of his popularity, and some of his accomplishments were soon brought to naught as Brazil slipped into a long period of weak governments, dictatorships, and constitutional and economic crises. The men who had exiled him soon began to see in him a model for the Brazilian republic. A few decades after his death, his reputation was restored and his remains were returned to Brazil with celebrations nationwide. Historians have regarded the Emperor in an extremely positive light and several have ranked him as the greatest Brazilian.

The only legitimate male child of Pedro&nbsp;I to survive infancy, he was officially recognized as heir apparent to the Brazilian throne with the title Prince Imperial on 6 August 1826.{{sfn|Vainfas|2002|p=198}}{{sfn|Calmon|1975|p=5}} Empress Maria Leopoldina died on 11 December 1826, a few days after a stillbirth, when Pedro was a year old.{{sfn|Calmon|1975|p=15}}{{sfn|Besouchet|1993|p=41}} Two and a half years later, his father married [[Am<U+00E9>lie of Leuchtenberg]].

Upon leaving the country, Emperor Pedro&nbsp;I selected three people to take charge of his son and remaining daughters. The first was [[Jos<U+00E9> Bonif<U+00E1>cio de Andrada]], his friend and an influential leader during [[Independence of Brazil|Brazilian independence]], who was named guardian.{{sfn|Lira 1977, Vol 1|p=17}}{{sfn|Schwarcz|1998|p=50}} The second was Mariana de Verna, who had held the post of ''aia'' ([[governess]]) since the birth of Pedro&nbsp;II.{{sfn|Carvalho|2007|p=31}} As a child, the then-Prince Imperial called her "''Dadama''", as he could not pronounce the word ''dama'' ([[Lady]]) correctly.{{sfn|Calmon|1975|p=5}} He regarded her as his surrogate mother, and would continue to call her by her nickname well into adulthood out of affection.{{sfn|Barman|1999|p=29}}{{sfn|Besouchet|1993|p=39}} The third person was Rafael, an [[Afro-Brazilian]] veteran of the [[Cisplatine War]].{{sfn|Carvalho|2007|p=31}}{{sfn|Calmon|1975|p=57}} He was an employee in the Palace of S<U+00E3>o Crist<U+00F3>v<U+00E3>o whom Pedro&nbsp;I deeply trusted and asked to look after his son<U+2014>a charge which he carried out during the rest of his life.{{sfn|Vainfas|2002|p=198}}{{sfn|Calmon|1975|p=57}}

Bonif<U+00E1>cio was dismissed from his position in December 1833 and replaced by another guardian.<ref>See:

* {{harvnb|Besouchet|1993|p=14}},
* {{harvnb|Lira 1977, Vol 1|pp=46, 50}}.</ref> However, the hours of study were strenuous and the preparation for his role as monarch was demanding. He had few friends of his age and limited contact with his sisters. All that coupled with the sudden loss of his parents gave Pedro&nbsp;II an unhappy and lonely upbringing.<ref>See:

The possibility of lowering the young Emperor's age of majority, instead of waiting until he turned 18, had been floated since 1835.<ref>See:

Barman, by 1840 "they had lost all faith in their ability to rule the country on their own. They accepted Pedro&nbsp;II as an authority figure whose presence was indispensable for the country's survival."{{sfn|Barman|1999|p=317}} When asked by politicians if he would like to assume full powers, Pedro&nbsp;II shyly accepted.<ref>See:

Removal of the factious regency brought stability to the government. Pedro&nbsp;II was seen nationwide as a legitimate source of authority, whose position placed him above partisanship and petty disputes. He was, however, still no more than a boy, and a shy, insecure and immature one.{{sfn|Barman|1999|pp=74<U+2013>75}} His nature resulted from his broken childhood, when he experienced abandonment, intrigue and betrayal.{{sfn|Barman|1999|p=66}} Behind the scenes, a group of high ranking palace servants and notable politicians led by [[Aureliano Coutinho, Viscount of Sepetiba|Aureliano Coutinho]] (later Viscount of Sepetiba) became known as the "Courtier Faction" as they established influence over the young Emperor. Some were very close to him, such as Mariana de Verna and Steward [[Paulo Barbosa da Silva]].{{sfn|Barman|1999|p=49}} Pedro&nbsp;II was deftly used by the Courtiers against their actual or suspected foes.{{sfn|Barman|1999|p=80}}

The Brazilian government secured the hand of Princess [[Teresa Cristina of the Two Sicilies|Teresa Cristina]] of the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]]. She and Pedro&nbsp;II were [[Proxy marriage|married by proxy]] in [[Naples]] on 30 May 1843.<ref>See:

One observer stated that he turned his back to Teresa Cristina, another depicted him as being so shocked that he needed to sit, and it is possible that both occurred.{{sfn|Barman|1999|p=97}} That evening, Pedro&nbsp;II wept and complained to Mariana de Verna, "They have deceived me, ''Dadama''!"<ref>See:

In late 1845 and early 1846 the Emperor made a tour of Brazil's southern provinces, traveling through [[S<U+00E3>o Paulo]] (of which [[Paran<U+00E1> (state)|Paran<U+00E1>]] was a part at this time), [[Santa Catarina (state)|Santa Catarina]] and [[Rio Grande do Sul]]. He was buoyed by the warm and enthusiastic responses he received.{{sfn|Barman|1999|p=111}} By then Pedro&nbsp;II had matured physically and mentally. He grew into a man who, at {{convert|1.90|m|ftin|sp=us}} tall{{sfn|Carvalho|2007|p=9}}{{sfn|Barman|1999|p=81}} with blue eyes and blond hair,<ref>See:
* {{harvnb|Schwarcz|1998|p=68}},
* {{harvnb|Barman|1999|p=97}},
* {{harvnb|Carvalho|2007|p=9}}.</ref> was seen as handsome.<ref>See:

* {{harvnb|Barman|1999|p=97}},
* {{harvnb|Calmon|1975|p=187}}.</ref> With growth, his weaknesses faded and his strengths of character came to the fore. He became self-assured and learned to be not only impartial and diligent, but also courteous, patient and personable. Barman said that he kept "his emotions under iron discipline. He was never rude and never lost his temper. He was exceptionally discreet in words and cautious in action."{{sfn|Barman|1999|pp=109, 122}} Most importantly, this period saw the end of the Courtier Faction. Pedro&nbsp;II began to fully exercise authority and successfully engineered the end of the courtiers' influence by removing them from his inner circle while avoiding any public disruption.{{sfn|Barman|1999|pp=109, 114}}

=== Abolition of slave trade and war ===
[[File:Pedro II of Brazil 1848.jpg|thumb|200px|alt=A head and shoulders daguerreotype portrait of a young man with short beard wearing a dark suit and cravat|Pedro&nbsp;II around age 22, c.&nbsp;1848. This is the earliest surviving photograph of the Emperor]]
Pedro&nbsp;II was faced by three crises between 1848 and 1852.{{sfn|Barman|1999|p=122}} The first test came in confronting the trade in illegally imported slaves. This had been banned in 1826 as part of a treaty with [[United Kingdom|Great Britain]].{{sfn|Barman|1999|p=123}} Trafficking continued unabated, however, and the British government's passage of the [[Aberdeen Act]] of 1845 authorized British warships to board Brazilian shipping and seize any found involved in the slave trade.{{sfn|Barman|1999|pp=122<U+2013>123}} While Brazil grappled with this problem, the [[Praieira revolt]] erupted on 6 November 1848. This was a conflict between local political factions within [[Pernambuco]] province; it was suppressed by March 1849. The [[Eus<U+00E9>bio de Queir<U+00F3>s Law]] was [[Promulgation|promulgated]] on 4 September 1850 which gave the Brazilian government broad authority to combat the illegal slave trade. With this new tool, Brazil moved to eliminate importation of slaves. By 1852 this first crisis was over, and Britain accepted that the trade had been suppressed.{{sfn|Barman|1999|p=124}}

The third crisis entailed a conflict with the [[Argentine Confederation]] regarding ascendancy over territories adjacent to the [[R<U+00ED>o de la Plata]] and free navigation of that waterway.{{sfn|Barman|1999|p=125}} Since the 1830s, Argentine dictator [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]] had supported rebellions within [[Uruguay]] and Brazil. It was only in 1850 that Brazil was able to address the threat posed by Rosas.{{sfn|Barman|1999|p=125}} An alliance was forged between Brazil, Uruguay and disaffected Argentines,{{sfn|Barman|1999|p=125}} leading to the [[Platine War]] and the subsequent overthrow of the Argentine ruler in February 1852.{{sfn|Barman|1999|p=126}}{{sfn|Carvalho|2007|pp=102<U+2013>103}} Barman said that a "considerable portion of the credit must be&nbsp;... assigned to the Emperor, whose cool head, tenacity of purpose, and sense of what was feasible proved indispensable."{{sfn|Barman|1999|p=122}}

The Empire's successful navigation of these crises considerably enhanced the nation's stability and prestige, and Brazil emerged as a hemispheric power.{{sfn|Levine|1999|pp=63<U+2013>64}} Internationally, Europeans began to regard the country as embodying familiar liberal ideals, such as freedom of the press and constitutional respect for civil liberties. Its representative parliamentary monarchy also stood in stark contrast to the mix of dictatorships and instability endemic in the other nations of South America during this period.<ref>See:

=== Pedro&nbsp;II and politics ===

At the beginning of the 1850s, Brazil enjoyed internal stability and economic prosperity.{{sfn|Barman|1999|p=159}}{{sfn|Schwarcz|1998|p=100}} Under the prime ministry of [[Hon<U+00F3>rio Hermeto Carneiro Le<U+00E3>o, Marquis of Paran<U+00E1>|Hon<U+00F3>rio Hermeto Carneiro Le<U+00E3>o]] (then-Viscount and later Marquis of Paran<U+00E1>) the Emperor advanced his own ambitious program: the ''concilia<U+00E7><U+00E3>o'' (conciliation) and ''melhoramentos'' (material developments).{{sfn|Barman|1999|p=162}} Pedro&nbsp;II's reforms aimed to promote less political partisanhip, and forward infrastructure and economic development. The nation was being interconnected through [[railroad]], electric [[telegraph]] and [[steamship]] lines, uniting it into a single entity.{{sfn|Barman|1999|p=159}} The general opinion, both at home and abroad, was that these accomplishments had been possible due to Brazil's "governance as a [[monarchy]] and the character of Pedro&nbsp;II".{{sfn|Barman|1999|p=159}}

Pedro&nbsp;II was neither a British-style [[figurehead]] nor an autocrat in the manner of [[List of Russian rulers|Russian czars]]. The Emperor exercised power through cooperation with elected politicians, economic interests, and popular support.{{sfn|Barman|1999|pp=161<U+2013>162}} The active presence of Pedro&nbsp;II on the political scene was an important part of the government's structure, which also included the cabinet, the [[Chamber of Deputies of Brazil|Chamber of Deputies]] and the [[Senate of Brazil|Senate]] (the latter two formed the General Assembly). He used his participation in directing the course of government as a means of influence. His direction became indispensable, although it never devolved into "one-man rule."{{sfn|Barman|1999|p=178}} In his handling of the political parties, he "needed to maintain a reputation for impartiality, work in accord with the popular mood, and avoid any flagrant imposition of his will on the political scene."{{sfn|Barman|1999|p=120}}

The Emperor's more notable political successes were achieved primarily because of the non-confrontational and cooperative manner with which he approached both issues and the partisan figures with whom he had to deal. He was remarkably tolerant, seldom taking offense at criticism, opposition or even incompetence.{{sfn|Barman|1999|p=164}} He did not have the constitutional authority to force acceptance of his initiatives without support, and his collaborative approach towards governing kept the nation progressing and enabled the political system to successfully function.{{sfn|Barman|1999|p=165}} The Emperor respected the prerogatives of the legislature, even when they resisted, delayed, or thwarted his goals and appointments.{{sfn|Barman|1999|pp=178<U+2013>179}} Most politicians appreciated and supported his role. Many had lived through the regency period, when the lack of an emperor who could stand above petty and special interests led to years of strife between political factions.

The marriage between Pedro&nbsp;II and Teresa Cristina started off badly.

Despite his affection for his daughters, he did not believe that Princess Isabel, although his heir, would have any chance of prospering on the throne. He felt his successor needed to be male for the monarchy to be viable.{{sfn|Barman|1999|pp=129<U+2013>130}} He increasingly saw the imperial system as being tied so inextricably to himself, that it would not survive him.{{sfn|Barman|1999|p=130}} Isabel and her sister received a remarkable education, although they were given no preparation for governing the nation. Pedro&nbsp;II excluded Isabel from participation in government business and decisions.{{sfn|Barman|1999|pp=151<U+2013>152}}

Sometime around 1850, Pedro&nbsp;II began having discreet affairs with other women.{{sfn|Barman|1999|p=128}} The most famous and enduring of these relationships involved [[Lu<U+00ED>sa de Barros, Countess of Barral|Lu<U+00ED>sa Margarida Portugal de Barros, Countess of Barral]], with whom he formed a romantic and intimate, though not adulterous, friendship after she was appointed governess to the emperor's daughters in November 1856.<ref>See:

Pedro&nbsp;II was hard-working and his routine was demanding. He usually woke up at 07:00 and did not sleep before 02:00 in the morning. His entire day was devoted to the affairs of state and the meager free time available was spent reading and studying.{{sfn|Barman|1999|p=134}} The Emperor went about his daily routine dressed in a simple black tail coat, trousers, and cravat.

This tranquility disappeared when the British consul in Rio de Janeiro, [[William Dougal Christie]], nearly sparked a war between his nation and Brazil.

Against all expectations, the war continued for five years. During this period, Pedro&nbsp;II's time and energy were devoted to the war effort.{{sfn|Barman|1999|p=193}}{{sfn|Carvalho|2007|p=110}} He tirelessly worked to raise and equip troops to reinforce the front lines and to push forward the fitting of new warships for the navy.{{sfn|Barman|1999|p=202}} The rape of women, widespread violence against civilians, ransacking and destruction of properties that had occurred during Paraguay's invasion of Brazilian territory had made a deep impression on him.{{sfn|Barman|1999|p=206}} He warned the Countess of Barral in November 1866 that "the war should be concluded as honor demands, cost what it cost."{{sfn|Barman|1999|p=230}} "Difficulties, setbacks, and war weariness had no effect on his quiet resolve", said Barman. Mounting casualties did not distract him from advancing what he saw as Brazil's righteous cause, and he stood prepared to personally sacrifice his own throne to gain an honorable outcome.{{sfn|Barman|1999|p=230}} Writing in his journal a few years previously Pedro&nbsp;II remarked: "What sort of fear could I have? That they take the government from me? Many better kings than I have lost it, and to me it is no more than the weight of a cross which it is my duty to carry."{{sfn|Barman|1999|p=169}}

At the same time, Pedro&nbsp;II worked to prevent quarrels between the national political parties from impairing the military response.{{sfn|Barman|1999|pp=219<U+2013>224}}{{sfn|Carvalho|2007|pp=116<U+2013>118}} The Emperor prevailed over a [[1868 Brazilian political crisis|serious political crisis in July 1868]] resulting from a quarrel between the cabinet and [[Lu<U+00ED>s Alves de Lima e Silva, Duke of Caxias|Lu<U+00ED>s Alves de Lima e Silva]] (then-Marques and later Duke of Caxias), the commander-in-chief of the Brazilian forces in Paraguay. Caxias was also a politician and was a member of the opposing party to the ministry.  The Emperor sided with him, leading to the cabinet's resignation. As Pedro&nbsp;II maneuvered to bring about a victorious outcome in the conflict with Paraguay, he threw his support behind the political parties and factions that seemed to be most useful in the effort. The reputation of the monarchy was harmed and its trusted position as an impartial mediator was severely impacted in the long term. He was unconcerned for his personal position, and regardless of the impact upon the imperial system, he determined to put the national interest ahead of any potential harm caused by such expediencies.{{sfn|Barman|1999|pp=224<U+2013>225}}

His refusal to accept anything short of total victory was pivotal in the final outcome.{{sfn|Barman|1999|p=206}}{{sfn|Carvalho|2007|p=114<U+2013>115}} His tenacity was well-paid with the news that L<U+00F3>pez had died in battle on 1 March 1870, bringing the war to a close.{{sfn|Barman|1999|pp=229<U+2013>230}}{{sfn|Carvalho|2007|p=121}} Pedro&nbsp;II turned down the General Assembly's suggestion to erect an [[equestrian statue]] of him to commemorate the victory and chose instead to use the money to build elementary schools.<ref>See:

On 25 May 1871 Pedro&nbsp;II and his wife traveled to Europe.{{sfn|Barman|1999|p=236}}{{sfn|Lira 1977, Vol 2|p=175}} He had long desired to vacation abroad.

The prestige of both Brazil and Pedro&nbsp;II were further enhanced during the tour when news came from Brazil that the Law of Free Birth, abolishing the last source of enslavement, had been ratified. The imperial party returned to Brazil in triumph on 31 March 1872.{{sfn|Barman|1999|p=240}}

Soon after returning to Brazil, Pedro&nbsp;II was faced with an unexpected crisis. The Brazilian clergy had long been understaffed, undisciplined and poorly educated, leading to a great loss of respect for the Catholic Church.{{sfn|Barman|1999|p=254}}{{sfn|Carvalho|2007|p=151}} The imperial government had embarked upon a program of reform to address these deficiencies.{{sfn|Barman|1999|p=254}} As Catholicism was the state religion, the government exercised a great deal of control over Church affairs, paying clerical salaries, appointing parish priests, nominating bishops, ratifying [[papal bull]]s and overseeing seminaries.{{sfn|Barman|1999|p=254}}{{sfn|Carvalho|2007|p=150}} In pursuing reform, the government selected bishops who satisfied its criteria for education, support for reform and moral fitness.{{sfn|Barman|1999|p=254}}{{sfn|Carvalho|2007|p=151}} However, as more capable men began to fill the clerical ranks, resentment of government control over the Church increased.{{sfn|Barman|1999|p=254}}{{sfn|Carvalho|2007|p=151}}

The bishops of [[Olinda]] and [[Bel<U+00E9>m]] (in the provinces of Pernambuco and [[Par<U+00E1>]], respectively) were two of the new generation of educated, zealous Brazilian clerics. They had been influenced by the [[Ultramontanism]] which spread among Catholics in this period. In 1872 they ordered [[Freemasonry|Freemasons]] expelled from [[Sodality (Catholic Church)|lay brotherhoods]].<ref>See:

This led to their trial and conviction by the [[Superior Court of Justice (Brazil)|Superior Court of Justice]]. In 1874 they were sentenced four years at hard labor, although the Emperor commuted this to imprisonment only.<ref>See:

While he avoided anything that could be considered unorthodox, he felt free to think and behave independently.{{sfn|Barman|1999|p=253}} The Emperor accepted new ideas, such as [[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of [[evolution]], of which he remarked that "the laws that he [Darwin] has discovered glorify the Creator".{{sfn|Besouchet|1993|p=34}} He was moderate in his religious beliefs, but could not accept disrespect to civil law and government authority.<ref>See:

In these proceedings there is no desire to protect masonry; but rather the goal of upholding the rights of the civilian power."{{sfn|Barman|1999|p=257}} The crisis was resolved in September 1875 after the Emperor grudgingly agreed to grant full amnesty to the bishops and the [[Holy See]] annulled the interdicts.<ref>See:

Once again the Emperor traveled abroad, this time going to the [[United States]]. He was accompanied by his faithful servant Rafael, who had raised him from childhood.{{sfn|Besouchet|1993|p=275}} Pedro&nbsp;II arrived in New York City on 15 April 1876, and set out from there to travel throughout the country; going as far as [[San Francisco]] in the west, [[New Orleans]] in the south, [[Washington, D.C.]], and north to [[Toronto]], [[Canada]].<ref>See:

Pedro&nbsp;II's trips abroad made a deep psychological impact. While traveling, he was largely freed of the restrictions imposed by his office.{{sfn|Barman|1999|p=245}} Under the pseudonym "Pedro de Alc<U+00E2>ntara", he enjoyed moving about as an ordinary person, even taking a train journey solely with his wife. Only while touring abroad could the Emperor shake off the formal existence and demands of the life he knew in Brazil.{{sfn|Barman|1999|p=245}} It became more difficult to reacclimate to his routine as head of state upon returning.{{sfn|Besouchet|1993|p=248}} Upon his sons' early deaths, the Emperor's faith in the monarchy's future had evaporated. His trips abroad now made him resentful of the burden destiny had placed upon his shoulders when only a child of five. If he previously had no interest in securing the throne for the next generation, he now had no desire to keep it going during his own lifetime.{{sfn|Besouchet|1993|pp=248, 253}}

During the 1880s, Brazil continued to prosper and social diversity increased markedly, including the first organized push for [[women's rights]].{{sfn|Barman|1999|p=319}} On the other hand, letters written by Pedro&nbsp;II reveal a man grown world-weary with age and having an increasingly alienated and pessimistic outlook.{{sfn|Barman|1999|pp=298<U+2013>299}} He remained respectful of his duty and was meticulous in performing the tasks demanded of the imperial office, albeit often without enthusiasm.{{sfn|Barman|1999|p=299}} Because of his increasing "indifference towards the fate of the regime"{{sfn|Lira 1977, Vol 3|p=126}} and his lack of action in support of the imperial system once it was challenged, historians have attributed the "prime, perhaps sole, responsibility" for the dissolution of the monarchy to the Emperor himself.{{sfn|Barman|1999|p=399}}

After their experience of the perils and obstacles of government, the political figures who had arisen during the 1830s saw the Emperor as providing a fundamental source of authority essential for governing and for national survival.{{sfn|Barman|1999|p=317}} These elder statesmen began to die off or retire from government until, by the 1880s, they had almost entirely been replaced by a younger generation of politicians who had no experience of the early years of Pedro&nbsp;II's reign, when internal and external dangers threatened the nation's existence. They had only known a stable administration and prosperity. In sharp contrast to those of the previous era, the young politicians saw no reason to uphold and defend the imperial office as a unifying force beneficial to the nation.{{sfn|Barman|1999|p=318}}

To those younger politicians Pedro&nbsp;II was merely an old and increasingly sick man who had steadily eroded his position by taking an active role in politics for decades. Before he had been above criticism, but now his every action and inaction prompted meticulous scrutiny and open criticism. Many young politicians had become apathetic toward the monarchic regime and, when the time came, they would do nothing to defend it.{{sfn|Barman|1999|pp=258<U+2013>259, 317<U+2013>318, 349}} Pedro&nbsp;II's role in achieving an era of national unity, stability and good government now went unremembered and unconsidered by the ruling elites. By his very success, the Emperor had made his position seem unnecessary.{{sfn|Barman|1999|p=xiv}}

The lack of an heir who could feasibly provide a new direction for the nation also diminished the long-term prospects of the Brazilian monarchy. The Emperor loved his daughter Isabel, but he considered the idea of a female successor as antithetical to the role required of Brazil's ruler. He viewed the death of his two sons as being a sign that the Empire was destined to be supplanted.{{sfn|Barman|1999|p=262}} Resistance to accepting a female ruler was also shared by the political establishment.{{sfn|Barman|1999|p=268}} Even though the Constitution allowed female succession to the throne, Brazil was still very traditional, and only a male successor was thought capable as head of state.{{sfn|Barman|1999|p=130}}

[[File:Petropolis-Cathedral4.jpg|thumb|250px|alt=Inside a gothic chapel, a marble effigy of a bearded emperor in uniform lies atop an intricately carved stone sarcophagus|Tomb of Pedro&nbsp;II and Teresa Cristina within the [[Catedral de Petr<U+00F3>polis|Cathedral of Petr<U+00F3>polis]]]]
After his fall, Brazilians remained attached to the former Emperor, who was still a popular and highly praised figure.{{sfn|Schwarcz|1998|p=497}}{{sfn|Martins|2008|p=66}} This view was even stronger among those [[Afro-Brazilian|of African descent]], who equated the monarchy with freedom because of his and his daughter Isabel's part in the abolition of slavery.{{sfn|Schwarcz|1998|p=469}} The continued support for the deposed monarch is largely credited to a generally held and unextinguished belief that he was a truly "wise, benevolent, austere and honest ruler", said historian Ricardo Salles.{{sfn|Salles|1996|p=15}} The positive view of Pedro&nbsp;II, and nostalgia for his reign, only grew as the nation quickly fell into a series of economic and political crises which Brazilians attributed to the Emperor's overthrow.{{sfn|Schwarcz|1998|p=496}}

Strong feelings of guilt manifested among republicans, and these became increasingly evident upon the Emperor's death in exile.{{sfn|Schwarcz|1998|pp=495<U+2013>496}} They praised Pedro&nbsp;II, who was seen as a model of [[Res publica|republican ideals]],{{sfn|Schwarcz|1998|p=508}} and the imperial era, which they believed should be regarded as an example to be followed by the young republic.{{sfn|Martins|2008|p=123}} In Brazil, the news of the Emperor's death "aroused a genuine sense of regret among those who, without sympathy for a restoration, acknowledged both the merits and the achievements of their deceased ruler."{{sfn|Barman|1999|p=402}} His remains, as well as those of his wife, were returned to Brazil in 1921 in time for the centenary of the Brazilian independence. The government granted Pedro&nbsp;II dignities befitting a head of state.{{sfn|Calmon|1975|pp=1914<U+2013>1915}}{{sfn|Barman|1999|p=405}} A national holiday was declared and the return of the Emperor as a national hero was celebrated throughout the country.{{sfn|Schwarcz|1998|pp=503, 508}} Thousands attended the main ceremony in [[Rio de Janeiro]] where, according to historian Pedro Calmon, the "elderly people cried. Many knelt down. All clapped hands. There was no distinction between republicans and monarchists. They were all Brazilians."{{sfn|Calmon|1975|p=1915}} This homage marked the reconciliation of Republican Brazil with its monarchical past.{{sfn|Barman|1999|p=405}}

Historians have expressed high regard for Pedro&nbsp;II and his reign. The scholarly literature dealing with him is vast and, with the exception of the period immediately after his ouster, overwhelmingly positive, and even laudatory.{{sfn|Schwarcz|1998|p=22}} He has been regarded by several historians in Brazil as the greatest Brazilian.{{sfn|Viana|1994|p=467}}{{sfn|Benevides|Azevedo|Alc<U+00E2>ntara|1979|p=61}} In a manner similar to methods which were used by republicans, historians point to the Emperor's virtues as an example to be followed, although none go so far as to advocate a restoration of the monarchy. Historian Richard Graham noted that "[m]ost twentieth-century historians, moreover, have looked back on the period [of Pedro&nbsp;II's reign] nostalgically, using their descriptions of the Empire to criticize<U+2014>sometimes subtly, sometimes not<U+2014>Brazil's subsequent republican or dictatorial regimes."{{sfn|Graham|1994|p=4}}
