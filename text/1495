'''Rory Storm''' (21 September 1939 - 28 September 1972) was an English singer and musician. He was born Alan Caldwell in [[Liverpool]]. Storm was the singer and leader of Rory Storm and The Hurricanes, a [[Liverpudlian]] band who were contemporaries of [[The Beatles]] in the late 1950s, and early 1960s. [[Ringo Starr]] was the [[drummer]] for The Hurricanes before joining The Beatles in August 1962.

The Hurricanes were one of the most popular acts on the Liverpool and [[Hamburg]] club scenes during their existence, although their attempt at a recording career was not successful. They released only two singles, the second one being a version of the ''[[West Side Story]]'' song "[[America (Leonard Bernstein song)|America]]", which was produced by The Beatles' manager [[Brian Epstein]].

When Storm's father died, he returned from Amsterdam to Liverpool to be with his mother at ''Stormsville'', at 54 Broadgreen Road, [[Broadgreen]], Liverpool. On 27 September 1972, Storm developed a [[Lower respiratory tract infection|chest infection]] and could not sleep properly, so he took sleeping pills. The next day Storm and his mother were both found dead. A [[post mortem]] revealed that Storm had not taken enough pills to kill himself, but it was suspected that his mother had, after finding her son's body.

'''Rory Storm''' was born Alan Caldwell in 21 September 1939, in Oakhill Park Estate, Stoneycroft, Liverpool, to Ernie and Vi (Violet) Caldwell.

== Music ==
Storm's first name for a group was Dracula & the Werewolves, but later settled on Al Caldwell's Texans.<ref name="Spitzp126"> Spitz 2005 p126</ref> Still known as Alan Caldwell, Storm opened The Morgue Skiffle Club in the cellar of a large [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] house at West Oakhill Park, on 13 March 1958.<ref name="Spitzp126"> Spitz 2005 p126</ref> It consisted of two rooms, painted black, that were connected by a long corridor, with skeletons painted on the walls and one blue light.<ref name="Spitzp126"> Spitz 2005 p126</ref> Groups played on Tuesdays and Thursdays for up to 100 people (above the age of 15) starting at 7.30 pm, including Storm's group (later called The Raving Texans) and [[The Quarrymen]], who later became The Beatles.<ref name="BillHarryPage2"/> After complaints about the noise, the police closed down the club on 1 April 1958, and Storm reopened it on 22 April 1958.<ref name="Spitzp152"> Spitz 2005 p152</ref> It was in the Morgue Skiffle Club that Harrison auditioned for The Quarry Men, playing "Guitar Boogie Shuffle" by [[Bert Weedon]], before being asked to join.<ref name="BillHarryPage2"/><ref name="Spitzp126"> Spitz 2005 p126</ref> Harrison later asked Storm if he could join his group, but Storm's mother refused, as she thought Harrison was too young.<ref name="Spitzp152"> Spitz 2005 p152</ref> 

Storm went to [[London]], on 11 April 1958, to participate in a [[cross-country running]] competition. During his stay he took part in a [[jam session]] at [[Chas McDevitt]]'s Skiffle Cellar, which resulted in an appearance on 30 April 1958, on [[Radio Luxembourg (English)|Radio Luxembourg]]'s Skiffle club programme playing "[[Midnight Special (song)|Midnight Special]]". In 1959, Storm's group consisted of himself on guitar and vocals, Johnny 'Guitar' Byrne (guitar/vocals) Paul Murphy (guitar/vocals) Reg Hales ([[washboard]]) and Jeff Truman ([[tea-chest bass]]). 'Spud' Ward, a former member of [[The Swinging Blue Jeans]], later played bass guitar.<ref name="BillHarryPage2"/> Storm met Ringo Starr at a talent contest called '6.5 Special'. Starr had previously played with The Eddie Clayton Skiffle Group and was then drumming with a group called Darktown Skiffle. Starr's first concert with Storm was on 25 March 1959, at the Mardi Gras in Mount Pleasant, Liverpool.<ref name="BillHarryPage2"/>

Storm changed the name of his group to Al Storm and the Hurricanes, Jett Storm and the Hurricanes, and finally, Rory Storm & the Hurricanes. The original line-up was Storm, Byrne, Ty Brian, Lu Walters (b. Walter Eymond) and [[Ringo Starr]].<ref name="BillHarryPage1"/><ref name="MerseyBeatIssueNo7">{{cite web |first= |last= |url=http://www.merseybeat.co.uk/articles-details.php?cat=Bill+Harry's+Mersey+Beat&id=311 |title=Issue No.7 |publisher=[[Bill Harry]] |date=[[1999-08-20]] |accessdate=2008-08-15}}</ref> Storm and The Hurricanes entered a competition managed by Carrol Levis called, 'Search For Stars', at the Empire Theatre on 11 October 1959 reaching second place ahead of 150 acts.<ref name="BillHarryPage2"/> The lineup of The Hurricanes which was finally settled on, until 1962, was Storm (vocals) Byrne (rhythm guitar) Ty (Charles) O<U+2019>Brien (lead guitar) Walters (bass guitar/vocals) and Ritchie Starkey (later 'Ringo Starr').<ref name="BillHarryPage3">{{cite web |first=Bill |last=Harry |url=http://triumphpc.com/mersey-beat/a-z/rorystorm-hurricanes3.shtml |title=While My Guitar Gently Weeps - The Tragic Story of Rory Storm & the Hurricanes (page 3) |publisher=[[Bill Harry]] |accessdate=2008-02-27}}</ref> The group played at The Cavern Club with The Cy Laurie Jazz Band on Sunday 2 January 1960, and a week later supported The Saints Jazz Band and Terry Lightfoot's New Orleans Jazz Band.<ref name="BillHarryPage3"/> Playing rock 'n' roll music was a problem at [[The Cavern Club]], as it was not allowed.<ref name="BillHarryPage3"/> When Storm and The Hurricanes played there on 17 January 1960, with Micky Ashman's Jazz Band and the Swinging Blue Jeans, their first song was "Cumberland Gap" (a skiffle song) by [[Lonnie Donegan]]  but then played "[[Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin On]]", by [[Jerry Lee Lewis]]. The jazz and skiffle audience were outraged, booed and threw copper coins at the group. Ray McFall (The Cavern's manager) fined them 6 [[shillings]], but the coins collected from the stage floor were worth more than the fine.<ref name="BillHarryPage3"/> 

Storm and The Hurricanes performed at The [[Liverpool Stadium]] on 3 May 1960, on the same bill as [[Gene Vincent]].<ref name="BillHarryPage3"/> [[Larry Parnes]] became interested in The Hurricanes, and invited them to audition at the Wyvern Club as a backing group for [[Billy Fury]]. Storm turned up at the audition, but only so he could have his picture taken with Fury.<ref name="BillHarryPage3"/> In July 1960, the group secured a residency at [[Butlins]] holiday camp in [[Pwllheli]] (playing in the Rock 'n' Calypso Ballroom) for <U+00A3>25 each per week.<ref name="BillHarryPage3"/> Starr was not sure about giving up his job as an apprentice at Henry Hunt's, where he made climbing frames for schools, until Storm put forward the idea of "Starr-time" (a solo spot) with Starr singing songs like "[[Boys (Dixon/Farrell song)|Boys]]" by [[The Shirelles]].<ref name="TheBeatlesAnthologyDVD1"> <U+201D>The Beatles Anthology<U+201D> DVD 1&2 2003 (Episode 1 - 0:31:06) Lennon talking about Starr's 'Starr-Time' and being a professional drummer.</ref> Starr finally agreed when Storm told him about how many women would be 'available'.<ref name="BillHarryPage3"/> It was during this season that Starr (who had been known as Ritchie until then) changed his name to Ringo.<ref name="BillHarryPage5">{{cite web |first=Bill |last=Harry |url=http://triumphpc.com/mersey-beat/a-z/rorystorm-hurricanes5.shtml |title=While My Guitar Gently Weeps: The Tragic Story of Rory Storm & the Hurricanes (page 5) |publisher=[[Bill Harry]] |accessdate=2008-02-29}}</ref> [[John Lennon]] refused to work in holiday camps like Butlins, even though they paid well, saying "It would be like playing in [[Belsen]]".<ref name="ByrneBiog">{{cite web |first=Spencer |last=Leigh |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_19990820/ai_n14242710 |title=Obituary: Johnny Guitar |publisher=[[The Independent]] |date=[[1999-08-20]]|accessdate=2008-02-28}}</ref><ref name="Spitzp323"> Spitz 2005 pp323-324</ref>

After playing for more than 16 hours per week, the group were contacted by [[Allan Williams]], who wanted them to go to [[Hamburg]]. Derry and The Seniors were successful there, and Williams wanted an additional group.<ref name="CynthiaJohnp76"> Cynthia Lennon <U+2013> <U+201C>John<U+201D> 2006 p76</ref> As Storm and the group were committed to Butlins, they turned Williams' offer down (as did [[Gerry & The Pacemakers]]) so Williams sent The Beatles to Hamburg instead.<ref name="Spitzp202"> Spitz 2005 p202</ref><ref name="BillHarryPage4">{{cite web |first=Bill |last=Harry |url=http://triumphpc.com/mersey-beat/a-z/rorystorm-hurricanes4.shtml |title=While My Guitar Gently Weeps: The Tragic Story of Rory Storm & the Hurricanes (page 4) |publisher=[[Bill Harry]] |accessdate=2008-02-29}}</ref> After the summer season ended in early October 1960, Storm and The Hurricanes were free to travel to Hamburg, replacing Derry and The Seniors at the [[Kaiserkeller]]. They arrived in Hamburg on 1 October 1960, having negotiated to be paid more than The Seniors or The Beatles.<ref name="Spitzp201"> Spitz 2005 p201</ref> They played five or six 90-minute sets every day alternating with The Beatles.<ref name="Spitzp216"> Spitz 2005 p216</ref><ref name="CynthiaJohnp76"/> Storm and The Hurricanes were later presented with a special certificate by [[Bruno Koschmider]] (the owner of the Kaiserkeller) for their performances.<ref name="BillHarryPage4"/>

The stage of the Kaiserkeller was made of planks of wood balanced on the top of beer crates, so the two groups made a bet to see to who would be the first to break it.<ref name="Spitzp219"> Spitz 2005 p219</ref> After punishing the stage for days, a slight crack appeared, and when Storm jumped off the top of the upright piano it finally broke.<ref name="Spitzp219"> Spitz 2005 p219</ref> Byrne remembered that as Storm hit the stage, it cracked loudly and formed a V-shape around Storm. He disappeared into it, and all the amplifiers and Starr's cymbals slid into the hole. Koschmider was furious, and had to replace the live music with a juke box. Both groups went across the road to ''Harold's cafe'' for breakfast, but were followed by Koschmider's doormen with [[Blackjack (weapon)|coshes]], who beat the musicians as punishment.<ref name="Spitzp220"> Spitz 2005 p220</ref><ref name="Spitzp221"> Spitz 2005 p221</ref>

During their eight-week residency Williams arranged a recording session at the Akoustik Studio, which was a small booth on the fifth floor of 57 Kirchenalle (The Klockmann-House) on Saturday 18 October 1960.<ref name="BillHarryPage4"/> Williams asked Lennon, McCartney, and Harrison from The Beatles to play and sing harmonies for Walters (of The Hurricanes) on the recording.<ref name="MerseyBeatIssueNo7"/> [[Pete Best]] (The Beatles' regular drummer at the time) was in town buying drumsticks, so Starr played drums, which was the first time Lennon, McCartney, Harrison and Starr played and recorded together.<ref>[http://www.beatlesource.com/bs/ao-smrtime.html Lou Walters' recording session] Retrieved: 29 January 2007</ref> They recorded three songs: "[[Fever (1956 song)|Fever]]", "[[September Song]]" and "[[Summertime (song)|Summertime]]".<ref name="BillHarryPage4"/>

=== Liverpool ===
Storm and The Hurricanes were the headlining group at the first "Beat Night", in the Orrell Park Ballroom, in March 1961. They were also invited for a season at the Butlins camp in [[Skegness]] in [[Lincolnshire]]. Sam Leach (a Liverpool promoter) arranged a series of dance nights at the Palais Ballroom in [[Aldershot]], starting on 9 December 1961.<ref name="BillHarryPage4"/> The first featured The Beatles, but as the local newspaper forgot to run the advertisement only 18 people turned up.<ref name="BillHarryPage4"/> The second Saturday was arranged for Rory Storm and The Hurricanes to perform, and as it was advertised this time, 210 people paid to get in. Leach's idea was to attract London agents to watch the series of concerts, but when he realised they would never travel out of London he abandoned the idea.<ref name="BillHarryPage4"/> 

Starr considered leaving Storm at that time to join Derry and The Seniors, but accepted a job with Tony Sheridan at the Top Ten Club on 30 December 1961, as Sheridan's offer of more money, a flat and a car was too good to refuse.<ref name="BillHarryPage4"/> Starr's stay with Sheridan was short-lived, as he found Sheridan's habit of changing the set list without telling his backing group beforehand frustrating, so he rejoined The Hurricanes.<ref name="BillHarryPage4"/> On 5 February 1962, Best fell ill and The Beatles had to play a lunchtime concert at the Cavern and an evening concert at the Kingsway club in [[Southport]]. As The Hurricanes had no concert that day Starr played with them live on stage for the first time (although he had recorded with them in Hamburg).<ref name="Spitzp300"> Spitz 2005 p300</ref> 

During a Hurricanes' residency at Butlins, Lennon and McCartney drove from Liverpool to Skegness, on 15 August 1962, to ask Starr to join The Beatles.<ref name="PeteForeverRingoNever">{{cite web |first= |last= |url=http://www.beatlesagain.com/breflib/pete.html |title=Reference Library: Pete Forever, Ringo Never! |publisher=[[Bill Harry]] |date=[[1962-08-23]]|accessdate=2008-02-27}}</ref> Shortly before, Starr had agreed to join Kingsize Taylor in Hamburg, as Taylor was offering [[<U+00A3>]]20 a week, but Lennon and McCartney offered <U+00A3>25 a week, which Starr accepted.<ref name="BillHarryPage5"/> Lennon and McCartney offered Storm to swap drummers (with Best replacing Starr) but Best rejected the idea.<ref name="BillHarryPage5"/> The Hurricanes would then become known for having a succession of drummers (including [[Paddy Chambers|Gibson Kemp]], Brian Johnson, John Morrison,[[Keef Hartley]] (August 1963) Ian Broad, and [[Quantum Jump|Trevor Morais]]) who would all stay with the group for a short period before leaving.<ref name="BillHarryPage5"/><ref name="BillHarryPage4"/><ref name="BandMembers">{{cite web |first=Arthur |last=Davies |url=http://artydrummer.bravehost.com/hurricanes.html |title=Line Ups index |publisher=artydrummer |year=2004|accessdate=2008-03-30}}</ref>

Despite Starr joining The Beatles, both groups would perform on the same bill during 1961, and at many concerts thereafter.<ref name="March1961IronDoor">{{cite web |first=Peter R. |last=McCormack |url=http://www.rickresource.com/irondoorclub/irondoorclubstorm.html |title=Liverpool Idol Sweeps Local Warehouse |publisher=rickresource |date=[[2004-09-29]]|accessdate=2008-03-30}}</ref> In 1962, both groups performed together at [[St Patrick]]'s Night Rock Gala ([[Knotty Ash]] Village Hall) Queen's Hall ([[Widnes]]) and with [[Little Richard]] at the Tower Ballroom. In 1963, Storm and The Hurricanes were filmed as part of the "Beat City" documentary, which was broadcast by [[Associated-Rediffusion]] Television.<ref name="Beat City">{{cite web |first= |last= |url=http://posters.imdb.com/title/tt1091615/ |title=Beat City |publisher=[[Associated-Rediffusion]] Television |date=[[1963-12-24]]|accessdate=2008-02-27}}</ref>

== Stage persona and lifestyle ==
[[Image:The Hurricanes in suits.jpg|left|thumb|250px|A photo taken outside ''Duncan the Tailors'' shop in Liverpool. Storm is in the middle and Starr is on the far left]]
When Storm became a professional singer, he changed his name to Rory Storm by [[deed poll]], and changed the name of his family's home in Broadgreen to ''Stormsville''.<ref name="BillHarryPage6"/> Storm was known for the extravagant clothes he wore and the cars he drove, once buying a pink [[Vauxhall Cresta]] for <U+00A3>800 in cash.<ref name="BillHarryPage1"/> A young man was once caught by a porter at [[Bootle]] railway station writing "I love Rory" over the walls, and when questioned, it turned out to be Storm himself.<ref name="BillHarryPage2"/> The Hurricanes wore matching suits on stage, but Storm wore a pink suit and pink tie, and during concerts he would walk over to the piano and comb his blond hair with an oversized comb.<ref name="Hurricanephotos">{{cite web |first= |last= |url=http://www.beatlesource.com/savage/1960/60.07-09%20butlins%20-%20ringo/60.07.XXbutlins-ringo.html |title=Rory Storm And The Hurricanes <U+2013> July to September 1960 |publisher=The Beatle Source |accessdate=2008-02-27}}</ref> Their stage wear changed from sunglasses and palm tree decorated shirts to red (and blue) suits.

Rod Punt (also known as Steve Day in Steve Day & the Drifters) remembered Storm arriving at the Orrell Park Ballroom for a concert with a [[boil]] on his face. When told about it, Storm pulled out a black velvet hood which had slits for his eyes and mouth, and played the whole concert with the hood on.<ref name="BillHarryPage1"/> At one concert at Bankfield House Youth club, [[Garston, Merseyside|Garston]], Liverpool, in 1965, the stage lighting failed between sets. Storm was upset until someone walked in with a big [[flashlight]], which Storm used to finish the concert.<ref name="BillHarryPage1"/> Storm used a pet monkey in some of the group's performances, as it attracted more people.<ref name="Spitzp151-152"> Spitz 2005 pp151-152</ref> At a [[New Brighton, Merseyside|New Brighton]] swimming baths performance for 1,600 people in 1963, Storm climbed to the top diving board, undressed to a pair of [[swimming trunks]], and then dived into the water at the end of a song.<ref name="BillHarryPage6"/> In January 1964, during a performance at the Majestic Ballroom, [[Birkenhead]], Storm climbed up one of the columns supporting the balcony, but slipped and fell 30 [[Foot (length)|feet]] to the floor below, fracturing his leg. At another performance on the New Brighton Pier, Storm made his way onto the Pavilion roof, but fell through the glass [[Daylighting|skylight]].<ref name="BillHarryPage6"/>

Storm and The Hurricanes received the most votes in the first Mersey Beat magazine [[poll]], but many votes were disqualified as they had been posted from the same place at the same time, and were written in green ink. (Although never proven, it was thought that Storm had posted the votes).<ref name="Spitzp288"> Spitz 2005 p288</ref> This meant that The Beatles reached the top position, with The Hurricanes coming fourth, even though The Beatles had also been sending in extra votes themselves.<ref name="BillHarryPage6"/><ref name="Spitzp288"/> Storm was often photographed for the magazine, such as being surrounded by nurses when he left hospital after breaking a leg during a performance, or playing for the Mersey Beat XI football team.<ref name="BillHarryPage6">{{cite web |first=Bill |last=Harry |url=http://triumphpc.com/mersey-beat/a-z/rorystorm-hurricanes6.shtml |title=While My Guitar Gently Weeps: The Tragic Story of Rory Storm & the Hurricanes (page 6) |publisher=[[Bill Harry]] |accessdate=2008-02-29}}</ref>

In 1967, O<U+2019>Brien (26) collapsed on stage during a performance, and later died due to complications after an [[appendicitis]] operation.<ref name="ByrneBiogPage2">{{cite web |first=Spencer |last=Leigh |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_19990820/ai_n14242710/pg_2 |title=Obituary: Johnny Guitar (page 2) |publisher=[[The Independent]] |date=[[1999-08-20]]|accessdate=2008-02-28}}</ref><ref name="Mersey Beat Nostalgia">{{cite web |first=Ian |last=Haskayne |url=http://www.merseybeatnostalgia.co.uk/html/rory_storm.html |title=Rory Storm |publisher=Mersey Beat Nostalgia |accessdate=2008-02-29}}</ref> Storm disbanded The Hurricanes and became a disc jockey, working at the Silver Blades [[Ice Rink]] in Liverpool, in [[Benidorm]] (he was also a water-skiing instructor there) in [[Jersey]] and [[Amsterdam]].<ref name="BillHarryPage7"/> When Storm's father died, he returned from Amsterdam to Liverpool to be with his mother. Storm developed a chest infection and could not sleep properly, so he took sleeping pills. On 28 September 1972, Storm and his mother were both found dead, at ''Stormsville''. The [[post mortem]] revealed that Storm had alcohol and sleeping pills in his blood (as had his mother) but not enough to cause his death, which was ruled accidental, although it could not be proven that his mother had committed [[suicide]] after finding Storm's body.<ref name="BillHarryPage7"/><ref name="RoryStormBiog">{{cite web |first= |last= |url=http://www.tropeamagazine.it/thebeatles/mersey/rory/rory.htm |title=Rory Storm and The Hurricanes |publisher=tropea magazine |accessdate=2008-02-27}}</ref><ref name="RoryDeathRingo">{{cite web |first= |last= |url=http://www.liverpooldailypost.co.uk/liverpool-news/regional-news/2008/01/10/world-s-number-one-drummer-was-a-fashion-starr-too-64375-20332801/ |title=World's number one drummer was a fashion Starr, too |publisher=[[Liverpool Echo]] |date=[[2008-01-10]]|accessdate=2008-03-30}}</ref> The funeral for Storm and his mother was at Oakvale Congregational Church, Broadgreen, on 19 October 1972. Mourners sang Storm's favourite song, "[[You'll Never Walk Alone (song)|You'll Never Walk Alone]]". The two coffins were carried from the hearse to the [[cremation]] (at Anfield Crematorium) by former band members.<ref name="BillHarryPage1"/> When Starr was asked why he did not attend, he said, "I wasn't there when he was born either."<ref name="BillHarryPage7"/> Although Starr had often offered to arrange for Storm to record whenever he wanted to, Storm was not interested in finding new or original material. His sister said: "He [Storm] was happy to be the King of Liverpool - he was never keen on touring, he didn't want to give up running for the Pembroke Harriers...and he'd never miss a Liverpool [[soccer|football]] match!"<ref name="BillHarryPage6"/>

Fury, whom Storm had met at the Wyvern Club auditions, later played the part of a singer called Stormy Tempest in the film, ''[[That'll Be the Day (film)|That'll Be the Day]]'' (1973) which was based on Storm. In 1987, a [[musical theatre|musical]] was staged in Liverpool about Storm and The Hurricanes called ''A Need For Heroes''.<ref name="ByrneBiogPage2"/>
