'''Dobrawa (D<U+0105>br<U+00F3>wka) ''' ({{lang-cs|'''Doubravka'''}}, {{lang-pl|'''Dobrawa'''}}) (ca. 940/45 <U+2013> 977) was a Bohemian princess member of the [[P<U+0159>emyslid dynasty]] and by marriage [[List of Polish consorts|Duchess of the Polans]].

She was the daughter of [[Boleslaus I, Duke of Bohemia|Boleslav I the Cruel]], Duke of [[Bohemia]], by his wife [[Biagota]].<ref name=<ref name="BOHEMIA">[http://fmg.ac/Projects/MedLands/BOHEMIA.htm#Dobrawadied977 BOHEMIA]</ref><ref>[http://genealogy.euweb.cz/bohemia/bohemia1.html#DB1 Complete Genealogy of the P<U+0159>emyslid dynasty]</ref>

According to earlier sources she urged her husband to accept the baptism in 966. However, modern historians believed that the change of religion by [[Mieszko I of Poland|Mieszko I]] was one of the points discussed in the Polish-Bohemian agreement performed soon before his marriage with Dobrawa, whose role in the conversion of her husband is now considered not as important as it was often represented by the medieval chronicles.

==Life==
===Date of birth===
There is no known date of Dobrawa's birth. The only indication is communicated by the chronicler [[Cosmas of Prague]] who stated that the Bohemian princess at the time of her marriage with Mieszko I was ''an old woman''.<ref>''Chronicle of Cosmas of Prague'': translated, introduction and commentary developed by Maria Wojciechowska, Warsaw 1968, lib. I cap. 27, p. 149.</ref> The message is regarded as tendentious and of little reliability, some researchers believe that the statement was made with malicious intent.<ref>H. <U+0141>owmia<U+0144>ski, ''Religia S<U+0142>owian i jej upadek'', Warsaw p. 338, footnote 889.</ref> It is possible that in the statement about Dobrawa's age, Cosmas was making a reference to the age difference between her and her sister Mlada. That would give him a basis for determining Dobrawa as "old." It also found that Cosmas confuses Dobrawa with Mieszko I's second wife [[Oda von Haldensleben|Oda]], who at the time of her marriage was around 19<U+2013>25 years old, a relatively advanced age for a bride according to the customs of the Middle Ages.

The chronicle of Cosmas does not lead to a more reliable conclusion. Consequently, the date of birth of Dobrawa remains unknown. Despite this, some researchers take up some speculative views, such as [[Jerzy Strzelczyk]], who assumed that ''in the light of contemporary concepts and habits of marriage of that time (when as a rule marriages were contracted with teenage girls) is assumed that Dobrawa had passed her early youth, so, it's probable that she was in her late teens or twenties''.<ref>J. Strzelczyk, ''Boles<U+0142>aw Chrobry'', p. 15.</ref>

===Early years===
About Dobrawa's childhood and youth are any notices. In 1895 [[Oswald Balzer]] overthrew the idea that previous to her marriage with Mieszko I, Dobrawa was married with [[Gunther, Margrave of Merseburg]] and they had a son, [[Gunzelin, Margrave of Meissen|Gunzelin]]. This view is based on the fact that [[Thietmar of Merseburg]] in his chronicles named Gunzelin, Gunther's son, ''brother'' of Boles<U+0142>aw I the Brave, Dobrawa's son.<ref>''Thietmari chronicon'', vol. V, cap. 18, p. 274; vol. V, cap. 36, p. 300; vol. VI, cap. 54, p. 390.</ref> Currently, historians believed that Gunzelin and Boles<U+0142>aw I are in fact cousins or brothers-in-law.<ref>View, inter alia, of Herbert Ludat.</ref>

===Marriage with Mieszko I and role in the Christianization of Poland===
In the second half of 964<ref>Date fixed by H. <U+0141>owmia<U+0144>ski, ''Pocz<U+0105>tki Polski'', vol. V, p. 548.</ref>  an alliance between Boleslav I the Cruel, Duke of [[Bohemia]], and Mieszko I of [[Poland]] was concluded. In order to consolidate the agreement, in 965 Boleslav I's daughter Dobrawa was married to Mieszko I.  There was a difference of religion between the spouses; she was a Christian, he was a Pagan.

Two independent sources attribute Dobrawa's important role in the conversion to Christianity of Mieszko I and Poland. The first is the chronicles of Thietmar, who was born two years before the death of Dobrawa; he wrote that the Bohemian princess tried to persuade her husband to accept Christianity (even at the cost of breaking their marriage and with this the Polish-Bohemian alliance); at the end, she finally obtained the conversion of Mieszko I and with him, of all Poland.<ref>''Thietmari chronicon'', vol. IV, cap. 56.</ref>

In turn, the 12th century chronicler [[Gallus Anonymus]] says that Dobrawa came to Poland surrounded by secular and religious dignitaries. She agreed to marry Mieszko I, providing that he was baptized. The Polish ruler accepted, and only then was able to marry the Bohemian princess.

However, modern historians allege that the baptism of Mieszko I was dictated by political benefits and should not be attributed to any action of Dobrawa, who according to them had virtually no role in the conversion of her husband.<ref>J. Dowiat, ''Metryka chrztu Mieszka I'', p. 79; Andrzej Feliks Grabski, ''Boles<U+0142>aw Chrobry. Zarys dziej<U+00F3>w politycznych i wojskowych'', p. 26; S. Trawkowski, ''Monarchia Mieszka I i Boles<U+0142>awa Chrobrego,'' pp. 116-117; H. <U+0141>owmia<U+0144>ski, ''Pocz<U+0105>tki Polski'', vol. V, p. 549.</ref> They note that the conversion of Mieszko I thanks to Dobrawa formed part of the tradition of the Church which stressed the conversion of Pagan rulers through the influence of women.<ref>A. F. Grabski, ''Mieszko I'', Warsaw 1973, p. 93.</ref>

On the other hand, literature doesn't refuse to give Dobrawa a significant role in the Christianization of the Poles. In her wedding procession, she arrived to Poland with Christian clergymen, among them possibly [[Jordan (Bishop of Poland)|Jordan]], the first [[Bishop of Pozna<U+0144>|Bishop of Poland]] (since 968).

Tradition attributes to Dobrawa the establishment of the Holy Trinity and St. Wit Churches in [[Gniezno]] and the Church of the Virgin Mary in [[Ostr<U+00F3>w Tumski]], [[Pozna<U+0144>]].

Dobrawa's marriage cemented the alliance of Mieszko I with Bohemia, which continued even after her death. On 21 September 967 Mieszko I was assisted by Bohemians in the decisive Battle against the Volinians led by [[Wichmann the Younger]].

When, after the death of [[Otto I the Great|Emperor Otto I]] in 973  the struggle for the supremacy in [[Germany]] began, both Dobrawa's husband and brother [[Boleslaus II, Duke of Bohemia|Boleslav II the Pious]], Duke of Bohemia, supported the same candidate for the German throne, Duke [[Henry II, Duke of Bavaria|Henry II of Bavaria]].

===Issue===
[[File:POL Warsaw Pa<U+0142>ac Ursyn<U+00F3>w9.jpg|thumbnail|270px|right|Bust in the Krasinski palace, [[Ursyn<U+00F3>w]], [[Warsaw]]]]
The marriage of Mieszko I and Dobrawa produced two children:
#[[Boles<U+0142>aw I Chrobry|Boles<U+0142>aw I the Brave (''Chrobry'')]] (b. 967 - d. 17 June 1025).
#a daughter, perhaps named <U+015A>wi<U+0119>tos<U+0142>awa, perhaps identical to the legendary [[Sigrid the Haughty]] (b. 968/72 - d. ca. 1016), perhaps married firstly with [[Eric VI of Sweden|Eric the Victorious]], King of [[Sweden]] and later wife of [[Sweyn I of Denmark|Sweyn Forkbeard]], King of [[Denmark]] by whom she is said to have been mother of [[Canute the Great]], King of Denmark, [[Norway]] and [[England]].

There is an hypothesis who stated the existence of another daughter of Mieszko I who was married with a Pomeranian Slavic Prince; she could be the daughter of either Dobrawa or one of his previous pagan wives.<ref>According to one theory, this unnamed daughter of Mieszko I and her Pomeranian husband were the parents of [[Zemuzil, Duke of Pomerania]].</ref> Also, exist the theory (apparently recorded by Thietmar and supported by [[Oswald Balzer]] in 1895) that [[Vladivoj, Duke of Bohemia|Vladivoj]], who ruled as Duke of [[Bohemia]] during 1002<U+2013>1003, was another son of Dobrawa and Mieszko I;<ref name=<ref name="BOHEMIA"/> although modern historians rejected this hypothesis, the Czech historiography supported mixed Piast-P<U+0159>emyslid parentage of Vladivoj.<ref>{{cite book |last1= Krzemie<U+0144>ska|first1= Barbara|authorlink1= |coauthors= |title= B<U+0159>etislav I.: <U+010C>echy a st<U+0159>edn<U+00ED> Evropa v prv<U+00E9> polovin<U+011B> XI. stolet<U+00ED>|trans_title= Bretislaus I: Bohemia and Central Europe in 1st Half of the XI Century|edition= 2nd.|date= |year= 1999|month= |publisher= Garamond|location= Praha|language= Czech|isbn= 80-901760-7-0|pages= 28<U+2013>29}}</ref>

===Death and burial===
Dobrawa died in 977. In his book published in 1888, [[J<U+00F3>zef Ignacy Kraszewski]] wrote that ''her tomb was discovered in [[Gniezno Cathedral]].  It was a simple stone marked with a cross. Purple robes and a weighty gold loincloth were the only objects found in her tomb.''<ref>J. I. Kraszewski, ''Wizerunki'', p. 12</ref> A similar view of Dobrawa's burial place was expressed earlier, in 1843, by [[Edward Raczy<U+0144>ski (1786<U+2013>1845)|Edward Raczy<U+0144>ski]] in his work ''Wspomnienia Wielkopolski to jest wojew<U+00F3>dztw pozna<U+0144>skiego, kaliskiego i gnie<U+017A>nie<U+0144>skiego'' (''Memories of the Greater Poland districts of Pozna<U+0144>, Kalisz and Gniezno'').<ref>E. Raczy<U+0144>ski, ''Wspomnienia Wielkopolski to jest wojew<U+00F3>dztw pozna<U+0144>skiego, kaliskiego i gnie<U+017A>nie<U+0144>skiego'', Pozna<U+0144> 1843, vol. II, pp 356-360.</ref> However, now the burial place of the Bohemian princess is considered to be unknown.<ref>K. Jasi<U+0144>ski, ''Rodow<U+00F3>d pierwszych Piast<U+00F3>w'', p. 78.</ref>

Dobrawa's death weakened the Polish-Bohemian alliance, which finally collapsed in the mid 980s.
