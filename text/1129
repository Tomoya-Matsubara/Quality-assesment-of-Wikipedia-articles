'''''Pallada''''' (Russian: '''''<U+041F><U+0430><U+043B><U+043B><U+0430><U+0434><U+0430>''''') was the last of the four {{sclass|Bayan|cruiser|0}} [[armored cruiser]]s built for the [[Imperial Russian Navy]] in the late 1900s. She was assigned to the [[Baltic Fleet]] during [[World War I]] where she captured [[codebook]]s from the German cruiser {{SMS|Magdeburg||2}} that had run aground during the first month of the war. The ship was torpedoed by a German submarine in October 1914 and exploded; none of the crew survived. ''Pallada'' was the first warship lost by the Russians during the war.

==Design and description==
''Pallada'' was {{convert|449.6|ft|1}} long [[length overall|overall]]. She had a maximum [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|57.5|ft|1}}, a [[Draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|26|ft|1}} and displaced {{convert|7750|LT|t}}. The ship had a crew of 568 officers and men. ''Pallada'' was named in honour of the [[Russian cruiser Pallada (1899)|earlier Russian cruiser]] captured by the Japanese during the [[Russo-Japanese War]].<ref name=m5>McLaughlin, p. 75</ref> Both ships were named for the Greek goddess, [[Pallas Athena]].<ref name=m8/>

The ship had two [[Marine steam engine#Triple or multiple expansion|vertical triple-expansion steam engines]] with a designed total of {{convert|16500|ihp|kW|lk=in|0}}, but they developed {{convert|19320|ihp|kW|lk=in}} on [[sea trial]]s and drove the ship to a maximum speed of {{convert|22.55|kn|lk=in}}. Steam for the engines was provided by 26 [[Belleville boiler]]s. She could carry a maximum of {{convert|1100|LT|t|0}} of coal, although her range is unknown.<ref name=m5/>

''Pallada''{{'}}s main armament consisted of two {{convert|8|in|adj=on|0}} 45-[[caliber (artillery)|calibre]] guns in single [[gun turret|turrets]] fore and aft. Her eight {{convert|6|in|adj=on|0}} gun were mounted in [[casemate]]s on the sides of the ship's hull.<ref name=w0>Watts, p. 100</ref> Anti-[[torpedo boat]] defense was provided by 20 {{convert|75|mm|adj=on}} 50-calibre guns; eight of these were mounted in casemates on the side of the hull and in the superstructure. The remaining guns were located above the six-inch gun casemates in pivot mounts with [[gun shield]]s. ''Pallada'' also mounted four {{convert|47|mm|in|adj=on}} [[Hotchkiss gun]]s. The ship also had two submerged {{convert|15|in|adj=on|0}} [[torpedo tube]]s, one mounted on each [[broadside]].<ref>McLaughlin, pp. 68, 75</ref>

The ship used [[Krupp armour]] throughout. Her [[Belt armor|waterline belt]] was {{convert|190|mm|1}} thick over her machinery spaces. Fore and aft, it reduced to {{convert|90|mm|1}}. The upper belt and the casemates were {{convert|60|mm|1}} thick. The armour [[deck (ship)|deck]] was {{convert|50|mm|0}} thick; over the central [[Artillery battery#Naval usage|battery]] it was a single plate, but elsewhere it consisted of a {{convert|30|mm|adj=on}} plate over two {{convert|10|mm|adj=on}} plates. The gun turrets were protected by {{convert|132|mm}} of armour and  the [[conning tower]] had walls {{convert|136|mm}} thick.<ref>McLaughlin, p. 68</ref>

==Service==
''Pallada'' was built by the [[Admiralty Shipyard]] in [[Saint Petersburg]]. Construction began on 24 June 1905,<ref>McLaughlin, p. 73</ref> although she was not formally [[laid down]] until August, and the ship was [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] on 10 November 1906. ''Pallada'' was completed in February 1911.<ref>Watts, p. 99</ref> She spent her entire career with the Baltic Fleet.<ref name=m8>McLaughlin, p. 78</ref>

On 26 August 1914, during the first month of World War I, the German [[light cruiser]] ''Magdeburg'' ran aground near the island of [[Osmussaar|Odensholm]] in the [[Gulf of Finland]]. Her escort, the [[destroyer]] {{ship|German destroyer|V-26||2}}, failed to pull her off and rescued part of the crew before ''Pallada'' and the [[protected cruiser]] {{ship|Russian cruiser|Bogatyr||2}} appeared and opened fire. The Germans blew up the front part of the ship, but failed to demolish the rest of the ship. They failed to destroy their naval codebooks, which were discovered by the Russians. A copy was later given to the British where it proved enormously helpful in reading German [[wireless]] traffic. Together with the armoured cruiser {{ship|Russian cruiser|Rurik|1906|2}}, ''Pallada'' unsuccessfully searched for German ships between [[Bornholm]] and [[Danzig]] on the night of 27 August. Less than two months later, on 11 October, she was torpedoed by the German [[submarine]] [[SM U-26|''U-26'']] and blew up with the loss of all hands, the first Russian warship sunk during the war.<ref>Halperin, pp. 36<U+2013>37, 184<U+2013>85</ref>
