'''''Bedsitcom''''' is a British [[reality television]] series that was broadcast on [[Channel 4]] in December 2003. Pitched as "somewhere between a sitcom and a reality TV show",<ref name="How real is reality TV?"/> the show documented the lives of six young people living in a [[Apartment|loft flat]] in London. Its [[Narrative hook|hook]] was that its TV audience was aware that three of the participants<U+2014>named Mel, Paul and Rufus<U+2014>were actually actors being directed by a trio of "writers" in a garage on the ground floor.

''Bedsitcom'' was commissioned by the [[Channel Four Television Corporation]] and produced by [[Objective Productions]]. Producers auditioned thousands of people to be the show's genuine contestants and selected from them six young adults to live in the flat with the three actors. These six contestants were told that they would be starring in a new reality TV series called ''Making Friends'', and featured on the show three at a time over a period of eight weeks. The programme ran for a single series of eight episodes and featured various storylines, involving dead goldfish, dodgy dealings, promiscuous mothers and telephone psychics.

The show received largely negative feedback from television reviewers, who criticised the show's premise as a "deeply offensive" idea.<ref name="New low hit by reality sickcom"/> It received a viewership peak of 1.2&nbsp;million with its final episode, giving it an audience share of 8.9&nbsp;per cent. ''Bedsitcom'' was not recommissioned for a second series and is currently not available either on DVD on Channel&nbsp;4's [[Video on demand|on demand]] service, [[4oD]].

To find suitable candidates to live with the three actors, producers auditioned roughly 10,000 people, who were told that they would be taking part in a new reality television programme in London called ''Making Friends''.<ref name="My flatmates are acting a bit weird.">{{Cite news|title=My flatmates are acting a bit weird.|first=Sarah|last=Knapton|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/My+flatmates+are+acting+a+bit+weird.-a0111642046|newspaper=[[Evening Chronicle]]|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]|location=[[Newcastle upon Tyne]]|date=26 December 2003|accessdate=12 November 2010}}</ref> Six members of the public, named Barrington, Bob, Dave, David, Jessica and Shirine, were selected to feature on the show.

===Writing and filming===
The plots for ''Bedsitcom'' were devised by a team of writers located in a garage on the ground floor of the apartment building that the contestants were staying in. The writers would often appear on screen and explain to the TV audience what their intention for each episode was.{{Sfn|Piper|2004|p=283}} They communicated with Ash, Gibbon and Jones either by ringing them on their mobile phones, or by calling them downstairs to speak to them in person.<ref name="Mark Lawson"/> The writers would occasionally change their plans for an episode<U+2014>in "Worst Case Scenario", for example, the writers altered their storyline from having Mel bring various animals into the flat to having the group kill Mel's goldfish after only one night.<ref name="How real is reality TV?"/>

Among the team of writers were [[Jesse Armstrong]] and [[Sam Bain]], who had created the Channel 4 sitcom ''[[Peep Show (TV series)|Peep Show]]'' with O'Connor earlier that year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.totalfilm.com/news/the-peep-show-team-are-magicians|title=The Peep Show team are Magicians|date=11 August 2006|publisher=[[Total Film]]|accessdate=7 April 2011|quote=...&nbsp;The team who make Channel 4<U+2019>s Peep Show <U+2013> actors Robert Webb and David Mitchell, alongside director Andrew O<U+2019>Connor and writers Sam Bain and Jesse Armstrong.&nbsp;...}}</ref> Filming of ''Bedsitcom'' began in May 2003 and lasted for approximately eight weeks.<ref name="My flatmates are acting a bit weird."/> The flatmates were filmed for 12 hours a day, with this footage then being edited down to roughly 25 minutes per week of filming.<ref name="How real is reality TV?"/>

A slightly more positive review came from Joe Joseph of ''[[The Times]]'', who suggested that "if it [the format] works, [it] could be profitably franchised around the world".<ref name="The Times"/> [[Deborah Bull]] said that, while it was "a terrible programme", there were "some funny lines".<ref name="Newsnight"/> Chris Wilson, editor of [[Collective (BBC)|Collective]], similarly wrote that "while the end results are often amusing and tackle some interesting storylines, the whole project smacks of lazy, cruel television".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/collective/A2082548|title=Reality TV gets desperate.|first=Chris|last=Wilson|date=28 November 2003|publisher=[[Collective (BBC)|Collective]]|accessdate=1 December 2010}}</ref>

In a 2005 interview, series creator Andrew O'Connor spoke about ''Bedsitcom'' and the critical reaction that it had received. He said that he felt that the premise of the show was a "great idea", but that it did not make "great television".<ref name="Independent"/> He also remarked: "We didn't cast it right and the public didn't take to the series."<ref name="Independent"/>
