'''Terrance Stanley "Terry" Fox''', {{Post-nominals|post-noms=[[Order of Canada|CC]], [[Order of the  Dogwood|OD]]}} (July 28, 1958 <U+2013> June 28, 1981) was a Canadian [[Humanitarianism|humanitarian]], [[sportsperson|athlete]], and [[cancer research]] activist.  He was a distance runner and [[basketball]] player for his [[Port Coquitlam]], [[British Columbia]] high school and [[Simon Fraser University]].  His right leg was amputated in 1977 after he was diagnosed with [[osteosarcoma]], though he continued to run using an artificial leg. He also played [[wheelchair basketball]] in Vancouver after losing his leg, winning three national championships.

In 1980, he attempted to run across Canada in the Marathon of Hope to raise cancer awareness. Fox hoped to raise one dollar for each of Canada's 24 million people. His effort began with little fanfare as he left [[St John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John's]],  [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] in April and ran the equivalent of a full marathon every day. Fox had become a national star by the time he reached [[Ontario]]; he made numerous appearances with the public, businessmen and politicians in his efforts to raise money for research. He was forced to end his run outside of [[Thunder Bay]] after 143 days and 5,300 kilometres when his cancer spread to his lungs. His hopes of overcoming the disease and completing his marathon ended when he died nine months later. 
 
Fox was the youngest person ever named a [[Order of Canada|Companion of the Order of Canada]], the nation's highest civilian award. He won the 1980 [[Lou Marsh Award]] as the nation's top sportsman and was named Canada's [[Canadian Newsmaker of the  Year|Newsmaker of the Year]] in both 1980 and 1981.  Today, millions of people in over 60 countries participate in the annual [[Terry Fox Run]], first held in 1981 and now the world's largest one-day fundraiser for cancer research; over [[Canadian Dollar|C$]]500 million has been raised in his name.  Considered a national hero, many buildings, roads and parks have been named in Fox's honour across the country.

==Early life and cancer==
Fox was born July 28, 1958 in [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]] to Rolly and Betty Fox. Rolly was a switchman for the [[Canadian National Railway]].<ref name="MtlGazette42880">{{cite news |last=Scrivener |first=Leslie |url=http://news.google.ca/newspapers?id=kBQyAAAAIBAJ&sjid=aaQFAAAAIBAJ&pg=1162,4206618 |title=Terry's running for the cancer society |work=Montreal Gazette |date=1980-04-28 |accessdate=2010-02-25 |page=21}}</ref>  Terry had an elder brother, Fred, a younger brother, Darrel and younger sister, Judith.<ref name="Greatest Canadian">{{cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/greatest/top_ten/nominee/fox-terry.html |title=The Greatest Canadian: Terry Fox |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |accessdate=2010-02-25}}</ref> His family moved to [[Surrey, British Columbia|Surrey]], [[British Columbia]] in 1966 then settled in [[Port Coquitlam, British Columbia|Port Coquitlam]] in 1968.<ref name="Greatest Canadian" />  His parents were dedicated to their family, and his mother was especially protective of her children; it was through her that Fox developed his stubborn dedication to what ever task he committed to do.<ref name="Scrivener13">Scrivener, 2000, pp. 13<U+2013>14</ref>  His father recalled that he was extremely competitive, noting that Terry hated to lose so much that he would continue at any activity until he succeeded.<ref name=Inwood>{{cite news |first=Damian |last=Inwood |title=Terry  Fox: 25 years; Celebrating his dream: a 12-page special section honouring the 25th Annual Terry Fox Run |work=Vancouver Province |date=2005-09-18}}</ref>

He was an enthusiastic athlete, playing [[soccer]], [[Rugby football|rugby]] and [[baseball]] as a child.<ref name="Scrivener16">Scrivener, 2000, pp. 16<U+2013>17</ref> His passion was for [[basketball]] and though he stood only five feet tall and was a poor player at the time, he sought to make his school team in grade eight. His physical education teacher and basketball coach at Mary Hill Junior High School suggested that he consider cross-country running instead.  Fox had no desire for the sport, but took it up because he respected and wanted to please his coach.<ref>Scrivener, 2000, p. 18</ref> He was determined to continue playing basketball however, even if he was the last player on the team.  Fox played only one minute in his grade eight season, but dedicated his summers to improving his play. He became a regular player in grade nine, and earned a starting position in grade ten.<ref>Scrivener, 2000, pp. 19<U+2013>20</ref> In grade 12, he co-won his high school's athlete of the year award with his best friend Doug Alward.<ref name="Greatest Canadian" /> 

Initially unsure if he wanted to go to university, Fox's mother convinced him to enroll at [[Simon Fraser University]], and expressing a desire to become a physical education teacher, he studied [[kinesiology]].<ref>Scrivener, 2000, p. 23</ref>  He tried out for the junior varsity basketball team, earning a spot ahead of more talented players due to his determination.<ref name="Greatest Canadian" />

On November 12, 1976, as Fox was driving home to Port Coquitlam, he became distracted by nearby bridge construction, and crashed into the back of a pickup truck.  While his car was left undrivable, Fox emerged with only a sore right knee. He again felt pain in December but chose to ignore it until the completion of his basketball season.<ref>Scrivener, 2000, p. 25</ref> By March 1977, the pain had intensified and he finally went to hospital where he was diagnosed with [[osteosarcoma]], a form of cancer that often starts near the knees.<ref name="Greatest Canadian" /> Fox believed his car accident weakened his knee and left it vulnerable to the disease though his doctors argued there was no connection.<ref>Scrivener, 2000, p. 27</ref> He was told that his leg had to be amputated and he would require [[chemotherapy]] treatments, but that recent medical advances meant he had a 50 percent chance of survival. It would have been just 15 percent two years before. The statement enforced a belief in Fox on the value of cancer research.<ref>Scrivener, 2000, p. 30</ref>

With the help of an artificial leg, Fox was walking three weeks after his amputation.<ref name="TSN25">{{cite web |url=http://www.tsn.ca/golf/story/?id=135201 |title=Looking back at the Marathon of Hope |publisher=The Sports Network |date=2005-09-01 |accessdate=2010-02-27}}</ref> He then progressed to playing golf with his father.<ref>Scrivener, 2000, p. 36</ref> Doctors were impressed with Fox's positive outlook, stating it contributed to his rapid recovery.<ref>Scrivener, 2000, p. 35</ref> He endured sixteen months of chemotherapy and found the time he spent in the British Columbia Cancer Control Agency facility difficult as he watched fellow cancer patients suffer and die from the disease.<ref>Scrivener, 2000, pp. 37<U+2013>38</ref> Fox ended his treatment with a new purpose.  He felt that he owed his survival to medical advances and wished to live his life in a way that would help others find courage.<ref>Scrivener, 2000, p. 41</ref>

[[Rick Hansen]], working with the Canadian Wheelchair Sports Association, invited Fox to try out for his [[wheelchair basketball]] team in the summer of 1977.<ref>{{cite news |last=Edwards |first=Peter |title=Man in Motion set to honour pal Terry Fox |work=Toronto Star |date=1987-01-03 |page=A13}}</ref> Although he was undergoing chemotherapy treatments at the time, Fox's energy impressed Hansen.<ref name="Greatest Canadian" />  Less than two months after learning how to play the sport from a wheelchair, Fox played for the national championship in Edmonton.<ref>Scrivener, 2000, p. 45</ref> He won three national championships with the team,<ref name="TSN25" /> and was named an all-star by the North American Wheelchair Basketball Association.<ref>Scrivener, 2000, p. 47</ref>

==Marathon of Hope==
[[File:Terry Fox Denkmal.jpg|thumb|Terry Fox statue in [[Beacon Hill Park]], Victoria, British Columbia|alt=Statue of a young man with an artificial leg looking forward as he runs. A caption on the pedestal reads "somewhere the hurting must stop...  Terry Fox 1958<U+2013>1981"]]
The night before his surgery, Fox was given an article about [[Dick Traum]], the first amputee to complete the [[New York Marathon]].<ref  name="Greatest Canadian" /> The article inspired him; he embarked on a 14-month training program, telling his family he planned to compete in a marathon himself.<ref name="MtlGazette42880" />  In private, he devised a greater plan. His experiences in hospital upset Fox, who became angry at how little money was dedicated to cancer research in Canada. He intended to run the length of Canada in the hopes of increasing cancer awareness, a plan he had initially only told Alward about.<ref>Scrivener, 2000, p. 58</ref>

Fox ran with an unusual gait, as he was required to hop-step on his good leg due to the extra time the springs in his artificial leg required to re-set after each step.<ref name="MtlGazette62380">{{cite news |url=http://news.google.ca/newspapers?id=2FQ0AAAAIBAJ&sjid=abkFAAAAIBAJ&pg=3901,1065955 |title=Runner wants to cross nation on one leg |work=Montreal Gazette |date=1980-06-23 |accessdate=2010-02-26 |page=1}}</ref>  He found the training painful. The additional pressure he had to place on both his good leg and his stump led to bone bruises, blisters and intense pain.  He found that after about 20 minutes of each run he crossed a pain threshold and the run became easier.<ref>Scrivener, 2000, p. 57</ref>

In August 1979, Fox competed in a marathon in [[Prince George, British Columbia]] where he finished in last place, ten minutes behind the nearest competitor. His effort was met with tears and applause from the other participants.<ref name="Greatest Canadian" />  Following the marathon, he revealed his plan to his family.<ref>Copeland, 2005, p. 29</ref> He initially hoped to raise $1 million,<ref>{{cite web |last=MacQueen |first=Ken |url=http://www.canadianencyclopedia.ca/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=M1ARTM0012749 |title=25th anniversary of Terry Fox's Marathon of Hope |work=MacLeans |publisher=Historica-Dominion Institute of Canada |date=2005-04-04 |accessdate=2010-03-20}}</ref> but later sought to raise $1 for each of Canada's 24 million people.<ref name="CBCLegacy">{{cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/fox_terry/ |title=Terry Fox's legacy of hope |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |date=2006-06-27 |accessdate=2010-02-25}}</ref>

===Canadian Cancer Society letter===
Fox began by sending a letter to the [[Canadian Cancer Society]] on October 15, 1979. He announced his goal and appealed for funding. Fox wrote:
{{cquote|My name is Terry Fox. I am 21 years old, and I am an amputee. I lost my right leg two-and-a-half years ago due to cancer. The night before my amputation, my former basketball coach brought me a magazine with an article on an amputee who ran in the New York Marathon. It was then I decided to meet this new challenge head on and not only overcome my disability, but conquer it in such a way that I could never look back and say it disabled me. 

But I soon realized that that would only be half my quest, for as I went through the 16 months of the physically and emotionally draining ordeal of chemotherapy, I was rudely awakened by the feelings that surrounded and coursed through the cancer clinic. There were faces with the brave smiles, and the ones who had given up smiling. There were feelings of hopeful denial, and the feelings of despair. My quest would not be a selfish one. I could not leave knowing these faces and feelings would still exist, even though I would be set free from mine. Somewhere the hurting must stop... and I was determined to take myself to the limit for this cause. 

From the beginning the going was extremely difficult, and I was facing chronic ailments foreign to runners with two legs in addition to the common physical strains felt by all dedicated athletes. 

But these problems are now behind me, as I have either out-persisted or learned to deal with them. I feel strong not only physically, but more important, emotionally. Soon I will be adding one full mile a week, and coupled with weight training I have been doing, by next April I will be ready to achieve something that for me was once only a distant dream reserved for the world of miracles <U+2013> to run across Canada to raise money for the fight against cancer. 

The running I can do, even if I have to crawl every last mile.

We need your help. The people in cancer clinics all over the world need people who believe in miracles. 

I am not a dreamer, and I am not saying that this will initiate any kind of definitive answer or cure to cancer. But I believe in miracles. I have to. 

Terry Fox, October 1979 <ref name=Inwood/>}}

He composed a second letter to various corporations seeking donations for "gas, a vehicle, running shoes, and money respectively."<ref name="Scrivener63">Scrivener, 2000, p. 63</ref> Fox also sent other letters asking for grants to buy a running leg. He observed here that while he was grateful to be alive following his cancer treatment, "I remember promising myself that, should I live, I would rise up to meet this new challenge [of fundraising for cancer research] face to face and prove myself worthy of life, something too many people take for granted."<ref name="Scrivener63" /> The [[Ford Motor Company]] donated a camper van,<ref name="Scrivener13" /> while [[Imperial Oil]] donated fuel and [[Adidas]] gave him his running shoes.<ref name="Murphy33">Murphy, 2005, p.  33</ref>  Fox turned away every company that requested he endorse their products and refused any donation that carried conditions; he insisted that nobody was to profit from his run.<ref name="Scrivener13" />

Although skeptical of his dedication, the Cancer Society agreed to support Fox once he had gained the support of sponsors but requested he get a medical certificate from a heart specialist that stated he was fit to attempt the run.  He was diagnosed with [[Left ventricular hypertrophy]]<U+2014>an enlarged heart<U+2014>a condition commonly associated with athletes.  Doctors warned Fox of potential risks he faced as a result though they did not consider his condition a significant concern.  They agreed to endorse Fox's run on the promise that he would stop immediately if he began to experience any heart problems.<ref>Scrivener, 2000, pp. 69<U+2013>70</ref>

===Trek across Canada===
The Marathon began on April 12, 1980.  Fox dipped his right leg in the Atlantic Ocean near [[St John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John's]], [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]], and filled two large bottles with ocean water. He intended to keep one as a souvenir and pour the other one into the Pacific Ocean upon completing his journey at [[Victoria, British Columbia]].<ref name="CBCLegacy" />  He was supported on his run by Alward, who drove the van and cooked meals, and by his brother Darryl.<ref name="Murphy33" />

Fox was met with gale force winds, heavy rain and a snowstorm in the first days of his run.<ref name="MtlGazette42880" /> He was initially disappointed with the reception he received, but was heartened upon arriving in [[Channel-Port aux Basques,  Newfoundland and Labrador|Port aux Basques,  Newfoundland]] where the town's 10,000 residents presented him with a donation of over $10,000.<ref name="Murphy33" /> He left the [[Maritimes]] on June 10 and faced new challenges entering [[Quebec]] due to his group's inability to speak French.<ref name="Scrivener232">Scrivener, 2000,  p. 232</ref>  He was left weary by drivers who continually forced him off the road.<ref>Scrivener, 2000, p. 96</ref>  Fox arrived in Montreal on June 22, one-third of the way through his 8,000km journey, having collected over $200,000 in donations.<ref name="MtlGazette62380" /> He spent additional time in Montreal after the Canadian Cancer Society asked him to delay his schedule so as to arrive in Ottawa for [[Canada Day]], a plan Fox agreed to only after being convinced it would aid fundraising efforts.<ref>Scrivener, 2000, p. 97</ref>

{{Quote box |quote ="Everybody seems to have given up hope of trying. I haven't. It isn't easy and it isn't supposed to be, but I'm  accomplishing something.

Fox crossed into Ontario at the town of [[Hawkesbury, Ontario|Hawkesbury]] on the last Saturday in June. He was met by a brass band and thousands of residents who lined the streets to cheer him on while the [[Ontario Provincial Police]] gave him an escort throughout the province.<ref name="Murphy34">Murphy, 2005, p. 34</ref> Despite the sweltering heat of summer, he continued to run 26 miles per day.<ref name="Scrivener232" /> Upon arriving in [[Ottawa]], Fox met [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Pierre Trudeau]] and [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]] [[Edward Schreyer|Ed Schreyer]] and was the guest of honour at numerous sporting events in the city.<ref name="Murphy34" />  He performed a ceremonial kickoff in front of 16,000 fans who gave him a standing ovation at a [[Canadian Football League]] game.  His journal reflected his growing excitement at the reception he had received as he began to understand how deeply moved Canadians were by his efforts.<ref>Scrivener, 2000, p. 118</ref>

A crowd of 10,000 people met Fox in [[Toronto]] where he was heralded in [[Nathan Phillips Square]].  As he ran to the square, he was met on the road by many people who joined him in running, including [[National Hockey League]] star [[Darryl Sittler]] who presented Fox with his 1980 All-Star Game jersey. The Cancer Society estimated it collected $100,000 in donations that day alone.<ref name="Greatest Canadian" /> As he continued through southern Ontario, he was met by [[Hockey Hall of Fame]]r [[Bobby Orr]] who presented him with a cheque for $25,000.  Fox considered meeting Orr the highlight of his journey.<ref  name="Greatest Canadian" />

As his fame grew, the Cancer Society scheduled him to attend an increasing number of functions and give more speeches.<ref>Scrivener, 2000, p. 123</ref> Fox attempted to accommodate any request that he believed would raise money, no matter how far out of his way it took him.<ref>Copeland, 2005, p. 91</ref> He bristled, however, at what he felt were media intrusions in his personal life<U+2014>The ''[[Toronto Star]]'' reported at one point that he had gone on a date.<ref>Scrivener, 2000, p. 130</ref>  He was left unsure of who he could trust in the media after negative articles began to emerge, including one by the ''[[Globe and Mail]]'' that characterized him as a "tyrannical brother" who verbally abused Darryl and claimed he was running because he held a grudge against a doctor who misdiagnosed his condition, claims he referred to as "trash".<ref name="Scrivener144" />

The physical demands of running a marathon every day took its toll on Fox's body. Other than at the request of the Cancer Society while in Montreal, he refused to take a day off, even on his 22nd birthday.<ref>Scrivener, 2000, p. 138</ref>  He frequently suffered shin splints and an inflamed knee.  He developed cysts on his stump and suffered dizzy spells.<ref>Copeland, 2005, p. 47</ref> Fox rejected calls for him to seek regular medical checkups,<ref>{{cite news |last=Harper |first=Tim |url=http://news.google.ca/newspapers?id=EaMyAAAAIBAJ&sjid=ie4FAAAAIBAJ&pg=980,3731630 |title=Medical check 'stupid', cancer marathoner scoffs |work=Ottawa Citizen |date=1980-07-30 |accessdate=2010-02-28 |page=1}}</ref> and dismissed suggestions he was risking his future health.<ref name="Scrivener144">Scrivener, 2000, p. 144</ref> At one point he suffered a soreness in his ankle that would not go away.  Although he feared he had suffered a stress fracture, he ran for three more days before seeking medical attention, and was relieved to learn he only suffered from [[tendinitis]] and that it could be treated with painkillers.<ref>Scrivener, 2000, p. 147</ref>

In spite of his immense recuperative ability,<ref>Scrivener, 2000, p. 133</ref> Fox found that by late August he felt exhausted before he began his day's run.<ref>Scrivener, 2000, p. 150</ref> On September 1, outside of [[Thunder Bay]], he was forced to stop briefly after suffering an intense coughing fit and experiencing pains in his chest.  Unsure of what else to do, he resumed running as the crowds along the highway shouted out their encouragement.<ref>Scrivener, 2000, pp. 153<U+2013>154</ref> A few miles later, experiencing a shortness of breath and still suffering the pain in his chest, he asked Alward to drive him to the hospital. He feared immediately that he had run his last mile.<ref>Scrivener, 2000, p. 155</ref> The next day he held a tearful press conference announcing that his cancer had returned and spread to his lungs. As a result, he was forced to end his run after 143 days and 5,300 kilometres.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.google.ca/newspapers?id=uTMyAAAAIBAJ&sjid=qaQFAAAAIBAJ&pg=1332,393909 |title=Weeping amputee ends Canada run: 'It's cancer again' |work=Montreal Gazette |date=1980-09-03 |accessdate=2010-02-28 |page=1}}</ref> While others offered to complete the run for him, Fox refused, stating that he wanted to complete his marathon himself.<ref name="Greatest Canadian" />

===National response===

Fox had raised $1.7 million when he was forced to abandon the Marathon.  He realized that the nation was about to see what the disease did, and hoped that it could lead to greater generosity.<ref>Scrivener, 2000, p. 163</ref> A week after his run ended, the [[CTV Television Network]] organized a nationwide [[telethon]] in support of Fox and the Canadian Cancer Society.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.google.ca/newspapers?id=vTMyAAAAIBAJ&sjid=qaQFAAAAIBAJ&pg=2345%2C3013106 |title=TV show raises $9 million for cancer |work=Montreal Gazette |date=1980-09-08 |page=1 |accessdate=2010-02-28}}</ref> Supported by Canadian and international celebrities, the five hour event raised $10.5 million.<ref name="Greatest Canadian" /> Among the donations were $1 million each by the governments of British Columbia and Ontario, the former to create a new research institute to be founded in Fox's name, and the latter an endowment given to the Ontario Cancer Treatment and Research Foundation.<ref>Scrivener, 2000, p. 168</ref>  Donations continued throughout the winter, and by the following April, over $23 million had been raised in Fox's name.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.google.ca/newspapers?id=-CMiAAAAIBAJ&sjid=-IcFAAAAIBAJ&pg=1251,3421230 |title=Fox's dream raised $23.4 million |work=Tri-City Herald |date=1981-04-12 |accessdate=2010-02-28 |page=44}}</ref>

Nearly 30 years after his death, Fox remains a prominent figure in Canadian folklore.  A 1999 national survey named him as Canada's greatest hero,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sfu.ca/terryfox/about.html |title=About Terry Fox |publisher=Simon Fraser University |accessdate=2010-03-05}}</ref> while he finished second to [[Tommy Douglas]] in the the 2004 [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] series ''[[The Greatest Canadian]]''.

===Terry Fox Run===
{{main|Terry Fox Run}}
One of Fox's earliest supporters was [[Isadore Sharp]], founder of the [[Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts|Four Seasons Hotels]]. Sharp had lost his own son to cancer and offered Fox and his companions free accomodation at his hotels where he could.<ref name="Greatest Canadian" /> He donated $10,000 and challenged 999 other businesses to do the same.<ref name="Marathon">{{cite web |last=Scrivener |first=Leslie |url=http://www.terryfox.org/Foundation/The_Marathon_of_Hope.html |title=Marathon of Hope |publisher=The Terry Fox Foundation  |accessdate=2010-03-01}}</ref> He also proposed an annual fundraising run in Fox's name.  Fox agreed, but insisted that the runs be non-competitive.  There were to be no  winners or losers, and anyone who participated could run, walk or ride.<ref name="Scrivener187">Scrivener, 2000, p. 187</ref> Sharp faced opposition in organizing the run. The Cancer Society feared that a fall run would detract from its traditional April campaigns, while other charities believed that an additional fundraiser would leave less money for their causes.<ref name="Millionaire">{{cite news |last=Scrivener |first=Terry |title=A  millionaire keeps Terry's memory alive |work=Toronto Star |date=1987-09-13 |page=D1}}</ref> Sharp persisted, and he, the Four Seasons Hotels and the Fox family organized the first Terry Fox Run for September 13, 1981.<ref name="Scrivener187" />

===Honours===
British rock star [[Rod Stewart]] was so moved by the Marathon of Hope that he co-wrote and dedicated the song ''Never Give Up on a Dream'', off his 1981 album [[Tonight I'm Yours]], in Fox's honour.

===Films===
Fox's story was dramatized in the 1983 [[biopic]] ''[[The Terry Fox Story]]''.  Produced by [[Home Box Office]], the film aired as a [[television movie]] in the United States and had a theatrical run in Canada.<ref name="1983FilmReviews">{{cite news |url=http://news.google.ca/newspapers?id=6kMwAAAAIBAJ&sjid=QaUFAAAAIBAJ&pg=4415,1524323 |title=More raves than boos for 'Terry Fox Story' |work=Montreal Gazette |date=1983-05-24 |accessdate=2010-03-06 |page=D10}}</ref> The film starred amputee actor [[Eric Fryer]] as Fox along with [[Robert Duvall]] and was the first film made exclusively for pay television.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.google.ca/newspapers?id=A68yAAAAIBAJ&sjid=6-4FAAAAIBAJ&pg=4635,4356556 |title='People will remember this...' |work=Ottawa Citizen |date=1982-09-20 |accessdate=2010-03-06 |page=37}}</ref> The movie received mixed but generally positive reviews,<ref name="1983FilmReviews" /> but was criticized by Fox's family over how it portrayed Terry's temper.<ref name="MacleansFilm">{{cite news |last=McKay |first=John |url=http://www.macleans.ca/culture/entertainment/article.jsp?content=20050912_112057_112059 |title=Terry Fox: A hero's story |work=Macleans Magazine |date=2005-09-09 |accessdate=2010-03-06}}</ref> ''The Terry Fox Story'' was nominated for eight [[Genie Awards]], and won five, including [[Genie Award for Best Motion Picture|Best Picture]] and [[Genie Award for Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role|Best Actor]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Lawson |first=Michael |url=http://news.google.ca/newspapers?id=l74yAAAAIBAJ&sjid=S-8FAAAAIBAJ&pg=1697,1159491 |title=Terry Fox Story awarded best picture, actor Genies |work=Ottawa Citizen |date=1984-03-22 |accessdate=2010-03-06 |page=93}}</ref>

A second movie, titled ''[[Terry (film)|Terry]]'', and focused on the Marathon of Hope was produced by the [[CTV television network]] in 2005. Fox was portrayed by [[Shawn Ashmore]]. Unlike Fryer, Ashmore is not himself an amputee; digital editing was used to superimpose a prosthesis over Ashmore's real leg. The film was endorsed by Fox's family, and portrayed his attitude more positively than the first movie had.<ref name="MacleansFilm" /> Canadian [[National Basketball Association]] star [[Steve Nash]], who himself was inspired by Fox when he was a child, directed the 2010 documentary ''Into the Wind'', which will be aired on [[ESPN]] as part of its [[30 for 30]] series.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/news/westcoastnews/story.html?id=006545a4-a2d6-4867-9adf-d60125176f14 |title=Nash to make film about Terry Fox |work=Vancouver Sun |date=2008-07-12 |accessdate=2010-03-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://30for30.espn.com/film/into-the-wind.html |title=Into the Wind |publisher=ESPN |accessdate=2010-03-06}}</ref>
