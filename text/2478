The son of the late Vicente Orestes Romualdez, a former dean of the law school of St. Paul<U+2019>s College in [[Tacloban City]], Kokoy Romualdez began his career in politics after serving as an assistant of then Speaker [[Daniel Romualdez]] from 1957 to 1961.

His brother-in-law, President [[Ferdinand Marcos]] appointed him as ambassador to China, Saudi Arabia and the United States while serving as Leyte governor until 1986, when his family went into exile following the [[People Power Revolution]].
