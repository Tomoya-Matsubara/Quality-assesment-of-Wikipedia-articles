'''Eric Charles Brewer'''<ref>{{cite web|title=Eric Brewer|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1191675/bio|publisher=Internet Movie Database|accessdate=2007-05-10}}</ref> (born [[April 17]], [[1979]]) is a [[Canada|Canadian]] [[professional]] [[ice hockey]] [[Defenceman (ice hockey)|defenceman]] who currently plays for the [[St. Louis Blues (hockey)|St. Louis Blues]] of the [[National Hockey League]]. Drafted in the 1st round, 5th overall by the [[New York Islanders]] in the [[1997 NHL Entry Draft]], Brewer has spent portions of his 8-year NHL career with the Islanders, the [[Edmonton Oilers]], and the Blues. He has also suited up for the [[Prince George Cougars]] of the [[Western Hockey League]] and the [[Lowell Lock Monsters]] of the [[American Hockey League]].

In February [[1999]], Brewer was named to the [[Prince George Cougars]]' all-time team in a [[Canadian Hockey League]] promotion.<ref>{{cite news|title=All-Time Junior Hockey Stars|publisher=The Globe and Mail|date=17 February 1999 |url= |accessdate=2007-05-10}}</ref> Brewer is a member of the [[BC Sports Hall of Fame]], having been inducted along with his fellow British Columbians from the [[List of Canadian national hockey team rosters#2002 Winter Olympics|2002 Canadian Olympic Men's Ice Hockey Team]] in [[2003]].<ref>{{cite web|title=2002 Olympic Men's Hockey Team|url=http://www.bcsportshalloffame.com/cgi-bin/search.cgi?team_id=42&stype=searchsport&keyword=Brewer,+Eric&type=ind&sport_id=1&year_=2007&category_id=team|publisher=BC Sports Hall of Fame and Museum|accessdate=2007-10-15}}</ref>

==Playing career==
===Prince George Cougars===
Brewer was drafted in the 6th round, 81st overall by the [[Prince George Cougars]], in the 1994 [[WHL Bantam Draft]].<ref>{{cite web|title=1994 Bantam Draft|url=http://www.whl.ca/news/bantam.php?id=70&showToc=1&|publisher=Western Hockey League|accessdate=2007-04-10}}</ref> One year later, Brewer began his WHL career with the Cougars, playing 63 games in the [[1995-96 WHL season|1995-96 season]] as a 16-year old. In his [[1996-97 WHL season|sophomore season]], Brewer finished with 29 points in 71 games for the Cougars, doubling his point total from the previous season and was named to play in the [[CHL Top Prospects Game|1997 CHL Top Prospects Game]].<ref name="legends">{{cite web| title=Eric Brewer|url=http://www.legendsofhockey.net:8080/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/SearchPlayer.jsp?player=11410|publisher=Hockey Hall of Fame and Museum|accessdate=2007-04-08}}</ref> This performance led to Brewer ranking as the top defenceman at sixth overall among North American skaters heading into the [[1997 NHL Entry Draft]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Kerr |first=Grant |title=Big day fast approaching for hopefuls|publisher=Daily News|date=17 June 1997 |url=|accessdate=2007-04-10}}</ref> In the end, Brewer was drafted in the 1st round, 5th overall by the [[New York Islanders]] in the [[1997 NHL Entry Draft|draft]] on [[June 21]], [[1997]].<ref>{{cite web| title=1997 NHL Entry Draft First Round Selections|url=http://www.nhl.com/futures/firstround90_99.html#97|publisher=National Hockey League|accessdate=2007-04-08}}</ref> Despite being drafted, Brewer stayed with Prince George for one last [[1997-98 WHL season|season]]. This final season turned out to be Brewer's best in the WHL. After representing Canada at the [[World Junior Ice Hockey Championships]], Brewer was named to the Western Conference team for the WHL All-Star Game,<ref>{{cite news||title=Portland, Spokane dominate all-star team|publisher=The Vancouver Sun|date=6 January 1998 |url=|accessdate=2007-04-10}}</ref> although he missed the game and much of the season due to injury.<ref name="legends"/> Despite this injury, Brewer finished the year with 33 points in only 34 games, a near point-per-game average, which lead to Brewer being named to the [[Western Hockey League|WHL]] West Second All-Star Team.<ref>{{cite news|title=Varlamov WHL's best; ALL-STARS|publisher=Edmonton Journal|date=12 May 1998 |url=|accessdate=2007-04-10}}</ref>

===New York Islanders===
On [[August 19]], [[1998]], just over a year after being drafted, Brewer signed his first professional contract with his draft team, the [[New York Islanders]]. The contract was an entry level three-year, $2.775-million deal which included a $1-million signing bonus.<ref>{{cite news|title=Cougs' Brewer NHL's newest millionaire|publisher=The Vancouver Sun|date=19 August 1998|url=|accessdate=2007-04-08}}</ref> With this contract in place, Brewer made his [[National Hockey League|NHL]] debut on [[October 10]], [[1998]] against the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]] and, on [[November 5]], against the [[Carolina Hurricanes]]' [[Trevor Kidd]], Brewer scored his first career goal.<ref name="legends"/> Brewer finished his rookie season with 11 points in 63 games, a respectable mark for any rookie defencemen; however, Brewer's [[1999-00 NHL season]] was not as productive. With only 2 assists in 26 games, Brewer spent a large portion of the season with the Islanders' [[American Hockey League|AHL]] affiliate, the [[Lowell Lock Monsters]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Swanson |first=Jim |title=Brewer going to summer school|publisher=Prince George Citizen|date=3 June 2000 |url= |accessdate=2007-10-15}}</ref> This dismal [[wiktionary:sophomore|sophomore]] season proved to be Brewer's last as an Islander.

===Edmonton Oilers===
On [[June 24]] at the [[2000 NHL Entry Draft]], the [[New York Islanders|Islanders]] traded Brewer, [[Josh Green]] and their 2nd round selection ([[Brad Winchester]]) in the [[2000 NHL Entry Draft|draft]] to the [[Edmonton Oilers]] for [[Roman Hamrlik]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Brownlee |first=Robin |title=Hamrlik headed to New York: Lowe deals D-man to Islanders for Green, Brewer|publisher=Edmonton Journal|date=25 June 2000 |url=|accessdate=2007-04-08}}</ref> Brewer, in the last year of his three-year entry level contract, finished the [[2000-01 NHL season|2000-01 season]] with a career high 21 points in 77 games and also produced 6 points in 6 playoff games. As a result, the Oilers re-signed Brewer to a one-year, $907,500 contract on [[August 15]], [[2001]].<ref name="2002deal">{{cite news|last=Ireland |first=Joanne |title= Brew back with Oiler crew: Blue-liner signs two-year, $4M deal at last second|publisher=Edmonton Journal|date=13 September 2002 |url=|accessdate=2007-04-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Hockey: Brewer, Suter get new deals|publisher=National Post|date=16 August 2001|url=|accessdate=2007-04-08}}</ref> Despite a decrease in pay, Brewer once again had a career year with 25 points in 81 games, so when a new contract was to be signed, a raise was expected. After a long [[holdout]] that lasted until the beginning of Oilers training camp, Brewer finally signed a two-year, $4-million contract on [[September 12]], [[2002]].<ref name="2002deal"/> Under this contract, Brewer played some of his best hockey. In the [[2002-03 NHL season|first year]] of the deal, Brewer set career highs in goals (8), assists (21), and points (29). It was also in this season that Brewer played in his first [[NHL All-Star Game]], dressing for the Western Conference in the [[53rd National Hockey League All-Star Game|53rd edition]] of the game.<ref>{{cite news|last=Stevens |first=Neil |title= NHL's biggest and newest names get first all-star nod|publisher=Sudbury Star|date=18 January 2003|url=|accessdate=2007-04-08}}</ref> In the [[2003-04 NHL season|second year]] of the deal, Brewer continued his strong play and finished with 25 points in 77 games. With the Oilers unwilling to pay what he was expecting, Brewer decided to go to salary arbitration to get a new contract. On [[August 4]], [[2004]], however, Brewer signed a one-year, $2.65-million contract with the Oilers, avoiding his arbitration hearing set for only a few days later.<ref>{{cite news|title=Brewer, Oilers avoid arbitration|publisher=CBC|date=5 August 2004|url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/story/2004/08/04/brewer040804.html|accessdate=2007-04-08}}</ref> Despite the new contract, Brewer was unable to play it out as a result of the [[2004-05 NHL Lockout]].<ref>{{cite news|last= |first= |title=Lockout over salary cap shuts down NHL|publisher=ESPN|date=16 February 2005 |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/news/story?id=1992793 |accessdate=2007-10-15}}</ref>

===St. Louis Blues===
On [[August 2]], [[2005]], in the summer following the [[2004-05 NHL Lockout|lockout]], the [[Edmonton Oilers|Oilers]] traded Brewer, [[Jeff Woywitka]] and [[Doug Lynch]] to the [[St. Louis Blues (hockey)|St. Louis Blues]] for [[Chris Pronger]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Matheson |first=Jim |title=Defensive posturing: Lowe nabs Pronger in deal for Brewer, Lynch and Woywitka|publisher=Edmonton Journal|date=3 August 2005 |url=|accessdate=2007-04-08}}</ref> At the time of the trade, Brewer was a restricted free-agent, so on [[August 15]], [[2005]], Brewer accepted the Blues' qualifying offer, signing a one-year, $2-million contract.<ref>{{cite news|last=Rutherford |first=Jeremy |title=Brewer signs for one year; Mayers OKs two-year deal|publisher=St. Louis Post-Dispatch|date=16 August 2005 |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=SL&p_theme=sl&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=10C0A6967286FF60&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM|accessdate=2007-04-08}}</ref> Brewer's [[2005-06 NHL season|first season]] with the Blues was a particularly bad one, playing only 32 games as a result of a dislocated left shoulder.<ref>{{cite news|title=Blues' Brewer could miss season following surgery|publisher=Associated Press|date=23 January 2006|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/news/story?id=2302645|accessdate=2007-04-08}}</ref> Despite this, the Blues re-signed Brewer to a one-year, $2.014-million contract. The [[2006-07 NHL Season|2006-07 season]] was a bit of a turnaround for Brewer, as he started to play much better under new coach [[Andy Murray (ice hockey)|Andy Murray]]. Amid speculation that he was going to be traded (as he would have been an unrestricted [[free agent]] following the season), he signed a four-year, $17-million contract extension with the Blues on [[February 24]], [[2007]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Blues re-sign Brewer and Legace|publisher=TSN|date=24 February 2007|url=http://www.tsn.ca/nhl/news_story/?ID=197451&hubname=nhl|accessdate=2007-04-08}}</ref>
