'''WASP-43''' is a [[Stellar classification#Class K|K-type]] star in the [[Sextans]] constellation. It is almost the same size as the Sun, but approximately half the mass. WASP-43 has one known planet in orbit, a [[Hot Jupiter]] called [[WASP-43b]]. At the time of publishing of WASP-43b's discovery on April 15, 2011, the planet was the most closely-orbiting Hot Jupiter discovered. The small orbit of WASP-43b is thought to be caused by WASP-43's unusually low mass. WASP-43 was first observed between January and May 2009 by the [[SuperWASP]] project, and was found to be cooler and slightly richer in metals than the Sun. WASP-43 has also been found to be an active star that rotates at a high velocity.

==Observational history==
WASP-43 was first observed by the WASP-South part of the planet-searching [[SuperWASP]] project between January and May 2009. It was determined from the collected data that WASP-43 could potentially host a planet that [[transit method|transited]], or crossed in front of, its host star as seen from Earth.<ref name=Hellier2011 /> Later observations by both the WASP-South and SuperWASP-North sections of SuperWASP between January and May 2010 yielded a total of 13,768 data points.<ref name=Hellier2011 />

Scientists interpreted that a 0.81-day orbit of a possible planet from the data, and followed up with observations using the [[CORALIE spectrograph]] on the [[Leonhard Euler Telescope]] at Chile's [[La Silla Observatory]]. CORALIE provided [[radial velocity]] measurements that indicated that WASP-43 was being transited by a planet that was 1.8 times Jupiter's mass, now dubbed [[WASP-43b]]. Another follow-up using the [[TRAPPIST]] telescope further defined the [[light curve]] of the body transiting WASP-43.<ref name=Hellier2011 />

WASP-43b's discovery was reported on April 15, 2011 in the journal ''[[Astronomy and Astrophysics]]''.<ref name=Hellier2011 />

==Characteristics==
WASP-43 is a [[Stellar classification#Class K|K-type]] star with a [[solar mass|mass]] that is 0.58 times that of the Sun, and a [[solar radius|radius]] that is 0.93 times that of the Sun. In other words, WASP-43 is far less massive than the Sun, but is approximately the same size. With an [[effective temperature]] of 4400 [[Kelvin scale|K]], WASP-43 is cooler than the Sun. It also has slightly lower quantities of iron than the Sun, with a measured [[metallicity]] of [Fe/H] = -0.05 (89% of that measured in the Sun).<ref name=EPE /> However, in general, the star has a slightly larger quantity of metals than the Sun. A notable exception is [[lithium]], which is not present in WASP-43's spectrum. However, the star's spectrum also indicates that WASP-43 is an active star.<ref name=Hellier2011 /> WASP-43 has been found to rotate quickly, although the exact mechanism that causes such speed in this rotation is uncertain, it may be possible that this is caused by tidal interactions between WASP-43 and its planet.<ref name=Hellier2011 />

With an [[apparent magnitude]] of 12.4, WASP-43 cannot be seen with the unaided eye.<ref name=EPE /> The star is located approximately 80 parsecs (260 light years) away from Earth.<ref name=Hellier2011 />

==Planetary system==
WASP-43b is a [[Hot Jupiter]] with a mass that is 1.78 times the [[Jupiter mass|mass of Jupiter]] and a radius that is 0.93 times [[Jupiter radius|Jupiter's radius]]. WASP-43b orbits its host star every 0.813475 days (19.5234 hours) at a distance of 0.0142 [[astronomical unit|AU]],<ref name=EPE /> the closest orbit yet found at the time of WASP-43b's discovery.<ref name=Hellier2011 /> WASP-43's unusually low mass accounts for WASP-43b's small orbit. Because planets with orbits around stars like WASP-43 are not usually observed, models either suggest that planets like WASP-43b are either uncommon or have short lifetimes caused by a decay in their orbits.<ref name=Hellier2011 />
