"'''Irresistible'''" is a song by American recording artist [[Jessica Simpson]] that [[Sony Music Entertainment|Sony Music]] released on April 12, 2001, as the [[lead single]] from her second studio album [[Irresistible (Jessica Simpson album)|of the same name]]. Its title and concept were proposed by singer-songwriter Pamela Sheyne, while [[Arnthor Birgisson]], an acquaintance of Sony chief executive officer [[Tommy Mottola]], and his partner [[Anders Bagge]] developed the melody and co-wrote the verses with Sheyne. The lyrics are more sexually suggestive than Simpson's previous songs.

The song, composed in the [[Key (music)|key]] of [[C major]], is a mid-tempo [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] number with [[dance-pop]] and [[funk]] influences. Instruments featured in the song include strings, synthesizers, percussion, and acoustic piano. The lyrics center on the tension between a young woman's sexual desires and her inhibitions. A [[So So Def]] [[remix]] of the piece features [[Bow Wow (rapper)|Lil' Bow Wow]] and [[Jermaine Dupri]], and incorporates samples of [[Kool & the Gang]]'s "[[Jungle Boogie]]" (1973).

The accompanying music video, directed by [[Simon Brand]], has a [[James Bond]] theme and features scenes of Simpson dressed as a spy. A music video for the So So Def remix was also filmed, featuring appearances by Dupri and Lil' Bow Wow inter-cut with scenes of Simpson. She performed the song as part of the [[set list]] of her DreamChaser Tour (2001) and [[Reality Tour (Jessica Simpson tour)|Reality Tour]] (2004). The single was also promoted with live performances on various televised appearances and the [[MTV]] ''[[Total Request Live]]'' Tour (2001).  "Irresistible" was featured on the [[List of Disney Channel Original Series|Disney Channel Original Series]] ''[[Lizzie McGuire (soundtrack)|Lizzie McGuire]]'' (2001).

Critics gave "Irresistible" mostly negative reviews noting the similarity to [[Pink (singer)|Pink]]'s "[[There You Go]]" (2000). Although a few praised the song for its theme and  production, most criticized Simpson's singing style, the sexual nature of the song's lyrics, and the over-use of digital sound enhancers. The song reached number eleven on the [[UK Singles Chart]] and number fifteen on the United States [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], while peaking within the top twenty in nine other countries. Despite not charting within the top twenty in Australia, it was certified [[List of music recording certifications|gold]] by the [[Australian Recording Industry Association]] (ARIA) for shipments of more than 35,000 copies within the country. The song ranked on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 and Australian year-end charts at numbers sixty-three and fifty, respectively.

<blockquote><p>   
"Pam came up with the title 'Irresistible', and as she started talking about the whole concept we immediately became inspired and began working on the music. You know, when we hear a concept or a title that we like<U+2014>no matter if it's ours or somebody else's<U+2014>both Anders and I get a feel for the song's vibe; a feel for whether a keyboard or guitar should be used to give it a certain character, be it upbeat or melancholic. So, when Pam mentioned the title, we immediately came up with the tempo and the whole feeling of the song, and then she came up with the lyrics. There was a really good flow to that song. We played around with the [[melody]], put down the demo, and it was done."<ref name="quote"/>

It begins with Simpson exiting a helicopter then entering a building to compromise evidence in a laboratory there. Simpson takes the elevator which opens onto a pathway. While she is walking, a gadget appears on the floor followed by a small explosion. In the next scene, Simpson walks through a water tunnel, out of which she is pulled by a robotic hand. As the video progresses, Simpson is shown dancing in a room full of mirrors. Scenes of ninjas climbing up a rope hanging from top of the building are inter-cut with scenes of Simpson dancing until the laboratory explodes. Simpson is next shown dancing on the rooftop alongside the ninjas before a helicopter arrives and Simpson boards it.
