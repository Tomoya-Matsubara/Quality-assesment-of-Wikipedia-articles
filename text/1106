 eponym=[[Willy Ley]]}}
'''Ley''' is a [[Moon|lunar]] [[impact crater]] that is located across the southern rim of the much larger walled plain [[Campbell (lunar crater)|Campbell]]. Intruding into the south-southwestern rim of Ley is the slightly larger crater [[Von Neumann (crater)|Von Neumann]].

The debris from the formation of Von Neumann has produced a bulging rampart that occupies the southwest interior floor of Ley. The outer rim of Ley has undergone impact erosion, and is marked by a number of small craterlets. The inner wall is also worn, and the interior floor is pock-marked by a number of tiny craterlets. There is a small, cup-shaped crater on the floor to the northwest of the mid-point.
