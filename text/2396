Achentoul Lodge was built c. 1900.  It is situated southeast of Loch An Ruathair, overlooking the moorland to the north of Kinbrace.<ref name="scottishplacesLodge">{{cite web|url=http://www.scottish-places.info/features/featurefirst4728.html|title=Achentoul Lodge|work=scottish-places.info|accessdate=23 October 2010}}</ref>

The lodge organizes [[Hind stalking]] and rabbit shooting on its farm during the winter months (October-February) to kill deer which are considered pests to the forest.<ref name="FF">{{cite web|url=http://www.firstfoot.com/tour/achentoul-estate-hind-stalking-1673.htm|title=Achentoul Hind Stalking|publisher=First Foot|accessdate=October 22, 2010}}</ref> It is considered a "sport" and the farm charges up to <U+00A3>130 for a session if the shooter hires a keeper, although a stalker is only permitted to kill two deer in a session.<ref name="FF"/> However, the farm claims that the hind stalking is for woodland conservation purposes primarily, given that the Achentoul estate by 1970 had dedicated 1000 acres for afforestation and sold 604 acres to the Forestry Commission.<ref>{{cite book|title=Strath of Kildonan: proposals for development|publisher=Volume 5 of Special reports, Highland and Islands Development Board|year=1970}}</ref> 

A notable family on the farm are the Nutting family who hired the late Donald Mackay to manage the farm in 1958. He worked in Achentoul for a long time with the Henderson brothers; he died in 2010, aged 76.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.northern-times.co.uk/news/fullstory.php/aid/7732/Mr_Donnie_Mackay,_Achentoul_and_Golspie.html|title=Mr Donnie Mackay, Achentoul and Golspie|publisher=''The Northern Times''|date=September 2, 2010|accessdate=October 22, 2010}}</ref>
