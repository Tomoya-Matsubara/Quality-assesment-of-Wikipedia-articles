{{nihongo|'''''Yoshino'''''|<U+5409><U+91CE>}} was a [[protected cruiser]] of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]]. ''Yoshino'' is sometimes regarded as a [[sister ship]] to the {{ship|Japanese cruiser|Takasago||2}}, although the two vessels are of different classes. The name ''Yoshino'' comes from the [[Yoshino District, Nara|Yoshino mountains]], located in the southern portion of [[Nara prefecture]]. She played an important role in the [[First Sino-Japanese War]], but was sunk in the [[Russo-Japanese War]] after being rammed by Japanese [[armored cruiser]] {{ship|Japanese cruiser|Kasuga||2}} in dense fog.

==Background== 
''Yoshino'' was an improved design of the [[Argentine Navy]] cruiser {{ship|Argentine cruiser|25 de Mayo||2}} designed by [[Philip Watts (naval architect)|Sir Philip Watts]], and built by the [[Armstrong Whitworth]] shipyards in [[Elswick, Tyne and Wear|Elswick]], in the [[United Kingdom]]. Watts was also responsible for the design of the {{ship|Japanese cruiser|Izumi||2}} and the {{sclass|Naniwa|cruiser}}s. .<ref> Brooke, ''Warships for Export'' page 58-60 </ref>  When commissioned, ''Yoshino'' was the largest ship in the Imperial Japanese Navy, and was also the fastest [[cruiser]] in the world when she entered service. <ref name=Evans>Evans, ''Kaigun'', p. 34.</ref><ref name=Elleman>Elleman, ''Modern Chinese Warfare'', p. 102.</ref>

==Design==
''Yoshino'' was a typical Elswick cruiser design, with a steel housing, divided into waterproof compartments, a low [[forecastle]], a single smokestack, and two masts. The [[prow]] was reinforced for [[Naval ram|ramming]].  The power plant was a triple expansion reciprocating [[steam engine]] with four cylindrical boilers, driving two screws. <ref name=Conway>Chesneau, '' Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships, 1860<U+2013>1905'', p. 226-227. </ref>

The [[main battery|main armament]] of ''Yoshino'' consisted of four separate Elswick [[QF 6 inch /40 naval gun]]s behind [[gun shield]]s, which were placed as bow and stern guns and in [[sponson]]s near the bridge. Secondary armament consisted of  eight Elswick [[QF 4.7 inch Gun Mk I<U+2013>IV]] quick-firing guns mounted on the sides of the hull and 22 [[QF 3 pounder Hotchkiss]] guns.

==Service record==
''Yoshino'' was laid down in February 1892, launched on 20 December 1892 and completed on 30 September 1893.
Soon after being placed into service, ''Yoshino'' was assigned to patrol duties off of the coast of [[Korea]] due to increasing tension between the [[Empire of Japan]] and the [[Qing dynasty|Empire of China]].
 
===First Sino-Japanese War===
On 25 July 1894, ''Yoshino'', {{ship|Japanese cruiser|Akitsushima||2}} and {{ship|Japanese cruiser|Naniwa||2}}, met two Chinese ships off the Korean coast in the [[Yellow Sea]]. The [[Beiyang Fleet]] cruiser {{ship|Chinese cruiser|Jiyuan||2}} and gunboat {{ship|Chinese gunboat|Guangyi||2}} has sortied from [[Asan]] to meet another Chinese gunboat, {{ship|Chinese gunboat|Caojiang||2}} and the leased transport ''Kowshing'' transporting 1100 troops and supplies as reinforcements to the Chinese garrison in Korea. Although not yet at formally at war, in what was later called the [[Battle of Pungdo]], the Japanese and Chinese squadrons exchanged gunfire, with ''Guangyi'' driven onto rocks and destroyed, ''Caojiang'' captured, and ''Jiyuan'' taking considerably damage before retreating. ''Yoshino'' despite its vaunted superior speed, was unable to catch ''Jiyuan'' before it disappeared into a fog bank. The transport ''Kowshing'' was sunk by ''Naniwa'' during the battle. . <ref name=Paine>Paine, ''The Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895: Perception, Power, and Primacy'' page 133-134</ref>

After the formal declaration of hostilities, ''Yoshino'' continued to participate in the [[First Sino-Japanese War]], including the [[Battle of Yalu River (1894)|Battle of the Yellow Sea]] on 17 September 1894.  ''Yoshino'' served as [[flagship]] for Japanese Admiral [[Tsuboi K<U+014D>z<U+014D>]] in a flying squadron which included {{ship|Japanese cruiser|Takachiho||2}}, ''Naniwa'' and ''Akitsushima''. <ref name=Elleman>Elleman, p. 102.</ref>During the battle, ''Yoshino'' assisted in sinking the Beiyang Fleet cruisers {{ship|Chinese cruiser|Jingyuan|1887|2}} and {{ship|Chinese cruiser|Zhiyuan||2}} and severely damaging the {{ ship|Chinese cruiser|Laiyuan||2}}.<ref name=Paine>Paine, p. 133-134.</ref>

Later, ''Yoshino'' was among the Japanese fleet units that took part in the [[Japanese invasion of Taiwan (1895)|invasion of Taiwan]], and bombarded [[Cihou Fort]], part of the coastal defences of [[Kaohsiung]] on 13 October 1895. Future admiral [[Yashiro Rokur<U+014D>]] served on ''Yoshino'' during this campaign as a [[lieutenant]].

===Russo-Japanese War===
With the start of the [[Russo-Japanese War]] of 1904-1905, ''Yoshino'' participated in the naval [[Battle of Port Arthur]].  However, soon after the start of the war, ''Yoshino'' collided with the Japanese [[armored cruiser]] {{ship|Japanese cruiser|Kasuga||2}} in dense fog. ''Kasuga's'' [[naval ram|ram]] hit ''Yoshino's'' port side, and penetrated to the engine room; ''Yoshino'' turned turtle and sank in the [[Yellow Sea]] at ({{coord|38|07|N|122|33|E}}) on 15 May 1904 with the loss of 319 lives. Only 19 of the crew managed to survive. <ref> Howarth, ''The Fighting Ships of the Rising Sun''  </ref>

As a result of this accident, the Imperial Japanese Navy removed the rams from the bows of all its warships. <ref name=Jentsura>Jentsura, ''Warships of the Imperial Japanese Navy'';</ref>
