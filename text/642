==Politics==
[[Image:Onyema Bill Cinton.jpg|200px|thumb|Ugochukwu with [[President of the United States|United States President]], [[Bill Clinton]]]] With Nigeria's return to democracy in 1998, Ugochukwu became the Director of Publicity at the ''Obasanjo for President'' Campaign Organisation, and contributed immensely to the election of [[Olusegun Obasanjo]] as the [[President of Nigeria]]. Ugochukwu was appointed as the ''Senior Special Assistant to the President on National Orientation and Public Affairs''. He spearheaded a "National Rebirth" campaign aimed at instilling patriotic virtues into a national psyche ravaged by years of political instability and corruption. It was on this platform that Ugochukwu launched the <U+201C>The Nigerian Declaration of Human Responsibilities<U+201D>, which declares in part: <U+201C>This Character on Human Responsibilities<U+2026> Seeks to bring freedom and responsibility into a better balance, to highlight and increase awareness of the obligation which we owe each other and to our nation<U+201D> [http://www.abiarebirth.com/abiarebirth_core.php?fid=bio].

===[[Conflict in the Niger Delta|Niger Delta crisis]]===
To soothe the political unrest in the oil-rich [[Niger Delta]] region of southern Nigeria, President  Olusegun Obasanjo signed the [[Niger Delta Development Commission|Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC)]] act of [[2000]] into law. Ugochukwu was appointed as the pioneer chairman of the newly created commission, charged with developing the nine oil producing states of the country, with excess oil revenues.<ref>{{cite web

Ugochukwu helped to articulate the president's vision of sustainable development in the [[Niger Delta]] region, and developed a policy which encouraged partnership amongst its stakeholders<U+2014>Niger-delta communities and their tribal chiefs, youth militia, oil companies and their executives, the [[Government of Nigeria|Nigerian government]], and Non-Government Organizations, and international organizations like the [[United Nations Development Programme|United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)]] and the [[World Bank]]. During Ugochukwu's tenure, the NDDC focused mainly on economic revival and prosperity, environmental rehabilitation, and the development of social and physical infrastructure[http://www.nigeriafirst.org/article_6738.shtml].

===Campaign for Abia Rebirth (CARE)===
[[Image:O Ugochukwu&Fidel Castro.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Ugochukwu (center) with [[President of Cuba|Cuban President]] [[Fidel Castro]], at [[Jos<U+00E9> Mart<U+00ED> International Airport]], [[Havana]], [[Cuba]].]]
At the end of his four-year tenure at NDDC, Ugochukwu returned to [[Abuja]] and continued to serve as the President's ''Special Adviser on Communications''. He took an interest in state politics, and resigned from office to join the [[Abia State]] gubernatorial race. In 2006, the Campaign for Abia Rebirth (CARE) was launched, with a promise to rebuild the state. On December 13th 2006, Ugochukwu emerged as the [[People's Democratic Party (Nigeria)|People's Democratic Party's]] candidate for the 2007 Abia State [[Governor of Abia State|gubernatorial elections]]. The hotly contested race was marred by allegations of electoral malpractice, and violence, all of which culminated in the election of Ugochukwu's rival, [[Theodore Orji]] of the [[Progressive Peoples Alliance|Progressive Peoples Alliance (PPA)]]. 

====Assassination attempt====
There was an attempt on Ugochukwu's life during the [[Governor of Abia State|Abia State Gubernatorial]] elections on April 14, 2007. The assailants fired shots at his [[motorcade]], fatally wounding one of his [[State Security Service|State Security Service (SSS)]] bodyguards, who suffered gunshot wounds through his head and hands. Ugochukwu, the [[People's Democratic Party (Nigeria)|People's Democratic Party (PDP)]] candidate and frontrunner in the election, blamed the attack on his political opponents in the [[All Nigeria Peoples Party|All Nigeria Peoples Party (ANPP)]] and [[Progressive Peoples Alliance|Progressive Peoples Alliance (PPA)]].<ref>{{cite web

====Election Petition Tribunal====
Ugochukwu sought redress at the Abia State Election Petition Tribunal. Governor [[Theodore Orji|Theodore Orji's]] election was annulled on February 25, 2008, on the grounds that he was ineligible to contest for the office. Orji and his deputy had failed to resign their respective positions in the Abia State government, 30 days prior to the election as stipulated in the [[Constitution of Nigeria|1999 Constitution]]. The Tribunal also cited Governor Orji's failure to prove beyond a reasonable doubt, his affiliation with a secret cult.<ref>{{cite web

However, on 11 February 2009 an appeal court in [[Port Harcourt]] overturned the ruling, declaring that [[Theodore Orji]] of the PPA had in fact won the election.<ref name=tday101/>
