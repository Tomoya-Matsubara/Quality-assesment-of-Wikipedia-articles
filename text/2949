'''Norman Clifford "Norm" Mager''' (March 23, 1926 <U+2013> March 17, 2005) was an [[United States|American]] [[basketball]] player who played in the [[National Basketball Association]] for the [[Baltimore Bullets (1944<U+2013>1954)|Baltimore Bullets]] during the [[1950-51 NBA season]].  Mager is also notable as a key member of the [[1949<U+2013>50 CCNY Beavers men's basketball team]], the only team in NCAA history to win both the [[National Invitation Tournament]] and [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|NCAA tournament]] in the same year.

Mager, a 6'5 [[Forward (basketball)|forward]] from [[Lafayette High School (New York City)|Lafayette High School]] in [[Brooklyn]], was a senior during the [[1949<U+2013>50 NCAA men's basketball season|1949<U+2013>50 season]].  He averaged 3.6 points per game during the seasoon, but had a strong postseason, averaging 12.6 points per game in the [[1950 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1950 NCAA tournament]] and was named to the All-Eastern regional team.  He was also important in the Beavers' [[1950 National Invitation Tournament|NIT]] run, averaging 4.7 points per game.<ref>[http://www.jewsinsports.org/profile.asp?sport=basketball&ID=166], accessed July 29, 2011</ref>

Following the close of his collegiate career, Mager was drafted in the fifth round of the [[1950 NBA Draft]] by the Baltimore Bullets.  Mager played 22 games for the Bullets, averaging 4.6 points and 2.0 rebounds per game.  However, his career came to a premature end in the wake of the [[CCNY Point Shaving Scandal]], where it was revealed that members of the Beavers had taken money to manipulate the outcome of several games.  Mager was thrown out of the NBA and other members of the CCNY team were banned for life from the league.<ref>{{cite news |title= Norman Mager, 78, Player Tarnished by Gambling Scandal, Dies|author= Richard Goldstein|newspaper= New York Times|date= March 23, 2005|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/23/sports/ncaabasketball/23mager.html |accessdate=July 29, 2011}}</ref>

Mager later became an executive with a janitorial supply company, retiring in 2000.  He died of cancer on March 17, 2005 in [[Boynton Beach, Florida]].
