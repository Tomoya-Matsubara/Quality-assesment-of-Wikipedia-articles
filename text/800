'''Gilbert Perreault''' (born [[November 13]], [[1950]], in [[Victoriaville, Quebec|Victoriaville]], [[Quebec]]) is a retired [[Canadian people|Canadian]] professional [[ice hockey]] [[Centre (ice hockey)|centre]] who played for seventeen seasons with the [[Buffalo Sabres]] of the [[National Hockey League|NHL]]. Known for his ability to stickhandle in close quarters, he was regarded as one of the most gifted and skillful playmaking centres ever to play the game.<ref name=LoHGP>{{cite web|url=http://www.legendsofhockey.net:8080/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/LegendsMember.jsp?mem=p199003&type=Player&page=bio&list=#photo|accessdate=2007-07-24|date=2007|publisher=Hockey Hall of Fame and Museum |work=legendsofhockey.net|title=The Legends:Gilbert Perreault}}</ref>  He is the original Buffalo Sabre because he was drafted first by the team in their inaugural season in the NHL. He is well known as the centre man for the prolific trio of Sabres forwards known as ''[[The French Connection (hockey)|The French Connection]]''.

Perreault was a standout [[Junior hockey]] player who went on to become a nine time [[National Hockey League All-Star Game|NHL ALL-Star]], two time Official [[NHL All-Star Team]] (second team centre) selection, a [[Calder Trophy]] winner, a [[Lady Byng Trophy]] winner and a [[Hockey Hall of Fame]]r.  He played his entire 17 year career with the Buffalo Sabres and continues to be the all-time franchise leader in career regular season games played, [[Goal (ice hockey)|goals]], [[Assist (ice hockey)|assists]], [[Point (ice hockey)|points]], game-winning goals, and [[Shot on goal|shots on goal]], serving as the team's captain from 1981 until his initial retirement in November 1986.  He led the team to eleven consecutive playoff appearances ending with the 1984<U+2013>85 season.<ref name=TP/>

Over the course of his 17 season career he accumulated 512 goals and 814 assists in 1191 games. Among his career highlights was the game winning goal in overtime of the 1978 [[National Hockey League All-Star Game]] played at the [[Buffalo Memorial Auditorium]].  Perreault once totaled seven points in a single game which remains a Sabres record.  He also recorded the first power play goal and the first hat trick in the team's history.  He is the only Buffalo Sabre to wear number 11, with the number being retired in his honor.

==Playing career==
===Amateur career===
Perreault began playing organized hockey at about age six.<ref name=LoHOoOGP/>  He preferred [[street hockey]] to playing on the ice and did not skate until he was eight.<ref name=HNT100>Dryden, p. 123.</ref>  At age nine, he made his first appearance at [[Minor hockey|Peewee hockey]] tournament in [[Quebec City]].  He left home at the age of 16 to join his first Junior hockey team.<ref name=LoHOoOGP>{{cite web|url=http://www.legendsofhockey.net/html/spot_oneononep199003.htm|accessdate=2007-07-24|date=2007|publisher=Hockey Hall of Fame and Museum |work=legendsofhockey.net|title=One on One with Gilbert Perreault}}</ref>  His first year (1966<U+2013>67) of junior hockey was spent with [[Thetford Mines]] in the [[Quebec Junior AAA Hockey League|Quebec Junior A League]].  His teammates included [[Rick Kehoe]] and [[Marc Tardif]].  The team won the league championships.  He then joined the [[Montreal Junior Canadiens]] after the Quebec Junior A League shut down for the 1967<U+2013>68 season, which was his first of three years with the Junior Canadiens.

His 49 points in 47 games helped the Junior Canadiens to a second place finish during his first season with the team.  During his second year on the team that included future NHL talents [[Rejean Houle]] and [[Andre Dupont]] as well as future professional teammates [[Jocelyn Guevremont]] and [[Rick Martin|Richard Martin]], Perreault blossomed.  His 97 points were second on the team to Houle's 108 points, and they earned him OHA First All-Star Team honours.  As Perreault blossomed, the team excelled.  In his second season, the team finished first the OHA and won the 1969 [[Memorial Cup]].  It was the first Memorial Cup win for Montreal since 1969.<ref name=LoHOoOGP/>

After Houle moved on to become the NHL's first overall pick, Perreault assumed the leadership role and compiled a 51 goal, 70 assist season, which led the team in both categories and second in the league to [[Marcel Dionne]]'s 132 points.  The Canadiens defeated the [[Weyburn Red Wings]] to become the third junior team to successfully defend their championship.

In 1969 and 1970, Perreault was on the [[Memorial Cup]]-winning Montreal Junior Canadiens, that provoked a change in Memorial Cup eligibility rules. Previously, all Junior Clubs in Canada were eligible for the cup, but the Junior Canadiens beat a club from [[Prince Edward Island]] so badly in the playoffs that Junior A was split into Major Junior and Junior A, with only the Major Junior clubs eligible for the trophy. After leading the Junior Canadiens to their second championship, he was named [[Ontario Hockey League|Ontario Hockey Association]] [[most valuable player]].<ref name=LoHGP/>

===Professional career===
In [[1969-70 NHL season|1970]], two new franchises were awarded in the NHL &mdash; the Buffalo Sabres and the [[Vancouver Canucks]].  Sabres General Manager [[Punch Imlach]] chose his favorite number, number eleven, for the [[roulette wheel]] spin to determine which franchise would have the first choice in the 1970 Entry Draft.<ref name=LoHOoOGP/> Buffalo, by the luck of the draw chosen by a roulette wheel, in which the number "11" came up for the Sabres, won the right to the first choice in the amateur draft. This was the first year that the [[Montreal Canadiens]] did not have a priority right to draft [[Qu<U+00E9>b<U+00E9>cois]] junior players. Consequently, Perreault was available and taken first overall by the Sabres.

Because the Sabres were an [[expansion team]] in 1970, the broadcast crew was also inexperienced, and famously the television broadcast cut away one night as Perreault picked up the puck behind the net. They had incorrectly assumed that the whistle would blow for an icing infraction, only to have [[Ted Darling]], the team's broadcaster, screaming into the microphone as they returned from the commercial describing Perreault's brilliant end to end rush and goal that the viewers had missed.

Perreault, wearing number #11 in honour of the roulette wheel's choice, became an immediate star.  His immediate impact included a goal in the franchise's very first game, which was a 2-1 victory on [[October 10]] [[1970]] against the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]].<ref name=TP>{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsecyclopedia.com/nhl/buffalo/sabres.html|accessdate=2007-07-24|title=Buffalo Sabres|publisher=Tank Productions|date=2007-05-10}}</ref> During his first season, he led the Sabres in scoring (with 38 goals and added 34 assists) &mdash; a feat he would never fail to accomplish in any season in which he did not miss significant time to injury before his penultimate year &mdash; and won the Calder Trophy as rookie of the year.

Perreault developed a reputation as a superb stickhandler.<ref name=HNT100/>  He scored a goal on his first shift in a professional scrimmage.<ref>Bailey, p. 12.</ref>  Bobby Orr once said about Perreault: "His head and shoulders go one way, his legs go the other way, and the puck is doing something else.  When I first saw it I couldn't believe it."<ref>McKinley, p. 180.</ref> His popularity and respect surpassed that of [[O.J. Simpson]] in a poll of Buffalonians about the best Buffalo athlete.<ref name=HNT100/>  [[Phil Esposito]] once said if anyone was to break his 76 goal, 152 point season records "It will be Gilbert Perreault."<ref name=HNT100/>  

Before the [[1971<U+2013>72 NHL season]] the Sabres drafted Perreault's Junior Canadiens teammate, Rick Martin, with their first pick.  The two gelled as a tandem with each scoring 74 points.  Late in the season the Sabres traded [[Eddie Shack]] for [[Rene Robert]].<ref name=TP/> The trio formed one of the [[decade]]s most memorable and exciting [[line (ice hockey)|lines]], known as "[[The French Connection (hockey)|The French Connection]]" with [[Rene Robert]] on right wing and [[Rick Martin]] on left wing.  They ended the following 1972<U+2013>73 season sweeping the top three scoring positions for the team and leading the franchise to its first playoff appearance with Perreault winning the Lady Byng Trophy as the most gentlemanly player.  In 1973<U+2013>74, Perreault endured a broken leg that limited him to 55 games.<ref name=LoHGP/>

The [[1974<U+2013>75 NHL season]] season was memorable for the Sabres' [[Stanley Cup Playoffs]] [[Stanley Cup Finals]] appearance.  The Sabres finished first in the newly reformatted league's [[Adams Division]], and the French Connection members each finished in the top ten in league scoring.  The Sabres defeated the [[Chicago Blackhawks]] and [[Montreal Canadiens]] on their way to a Finals appearance against the [[Philadelphia Flyers]].<ref name=TP/>  The Sabres lost the series four games to two.  1975 was the closest that Perreault would come to winning the Stanley Cup.

He was named to the [[Canadian national men's hockey team|Canadian national team]] ("Team Canada") that participated in the [[1972 Summit Series]] against the [[Soviet national ice hockey team|Soviet Union]] but managed to contribute two goals in two games and left the team before the series ended.<ref name=LoHOoOGP/> In 1976, Canada hosted the first Canada Cup series and boasted what many believe is the greatest Canadian team ever assembled. Perreault played with future Hockey Hall of Fame members such as [[Bobby Orr]], [[Darryl Sittler]], [[Bobby Hull]], [[Guy Lafleur]] and [[Marcel Dionne]]. Perreault often played on a line with fellow Qu<U+00E9>b<U+00E9>cois Lafleur and Dionne. Canada won the series after beating Czechoslovakia in a best two out of three. He later played in the [[1981 Canada Cup]] on a line with [[Wayne Gretzky]] and Lafleur. He was playing some of the best hockey of his career, leading all scorers with nine points in four games, when he was forced out of the tournament with a broken ankle. Canada lost the final to the [[Soviet national ice hockey team|USSR]] 8&ndash;1.

==Retirement==

Perreault retired at the end of the 1986 season. Thereafter, pension changes came into effect significantly boosting the pensions of retired players who played at least twenty games in the [[1986<U+2013>87 NHL season|1987]] season. He duly came out of retirement, and still played effectively, scoring 9 goals in the first 14 games.<ref name=TP/> He retired for good on [[November 24]] [[1986]] after his twentieth game.<ref name=TP/>  

He finished his career with scoring totals of 512 goals and 814 assists for 1326 points in 1191 games. At the time of his retirement, Perreault was the sixth leading scorer in NHL history. He was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1990, and the Sabres retired his number 11 in the same year.<ref name=LoHOoOGP/>

Since his retirement from hockey, Perreault has remained active in the game, coaching Junior teams in the [[Quebec Major Junior Hockey League]]. In addition, he also plays on occasion with the [[Buffalo Sabres Alumni Hockey Team]] for charity events.
