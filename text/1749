==Life and career==
===Childhood and youth===
Girado was born on November 1, 1980<ref name=NSS/> in [[Pasay City]], [[Metro Manila]], [[Philippines]].<ref name=ShortBio>"[http://bestuff.com/stuff/nina-soul-siren Nina's birthplace and information]". ''bestuff.com'' Accessed October 17, 2009</ref> She was raised by her parents, Filbert Girado, a [[Bayanihan]] Boys Choir member, and Maria Daulet, a [[pianist]], in [[Quezon City]]<ref name=FacebookInfo>"[http://www.facebook.com/pages/Nina-Soul-Siren/131542491361?v=info Nina's hometown on Facebook]". ''facebook.com/Nina Girado info'' Accessed October 17, 2009</ref> together with her siblings Dew-Anne, Ardie and Filbert "King", Jr. When she was five years old, Nina started singing in a corner of a room, and her father noticed it. Seeing the potential, Filbert trained her massively, and like the traditional way, she was submerged into a drum of water, while belting out her high notes. Later, Nina joined the most popular defunct talent search in the Philippines, ''Tanghalan Ng Kampeon''.<ref name=NinaAS>"[http://www.audiostreet.net/artist.aspx?artistid=55988&mode=info Nina's brief Audio Street biography]". ''audiostreet.net'' Accessed October 17, 2009</ref> She became a champion for seven weeks of the show.

Filbert's plans for Nina have changed when she grew older. Instead of a professional music career, he wanted his daughter to earn [[college degree]] and to join him in the [[United states]] to find work. Nina took up [[Accountancy]] at [[Miriam College]], since she was good at numbers. Her father added to her that she would take up [[Law]] after the course. Because of too much love for singing, Nina disobeyed her father and joined different bands.

At seventeen, Nina became a vocalist of the XS.<ref name=NSSAbout>"[http://www.ninasoulsiren.com/about/ Nina's NSS biography]". ''ninasoulsiren.com/About'' Accessed October 17, 2009</ref> Her father knew about it and could not stop her. Instead, he insisted that she should maintain good grades. Nina did get good grades, and was even a consistent [[dean's list]]er. In 2000, she finished Accountancy and joined bands like The Big Thing, [[MYMP]], Silk and lastly, the Essence. After college, Nina recorded an amateur [[demo (music)|demo CD]] with the help of a friend. It was composed of three tracks, including the [[Steve Perry]] song "[[Foolish Heart (song)|Foolish Heart]]", "[[Breathe Again]]" and "[[Against All Odds (Take a Look at Me Now)]]",<ref name=SP>"[http://www.koleksyon.com/showbiz/reviews/music_news/nina.asp Nina's interview on her musical begginings and training]". ''koleksyon.com'' Accessed December 31, 2009</ref> recorded in a home studio with only a guitar for accompaniment. Ricky Ilacad, the managing director of [[Warner Music Group|Warner Music Philippines]] at that time, was so impressed he wanted to sign her up without even seeing or hearing her in person. Two years later, her father died of [[heart attack]], and she signed up her first contract with the label.

===Early commercial success: 2002<U+2013>2004===
In the last quarter of 2002, Girado released her [[debut album]] under [[Warner Music]], entitled ''[[Heaven (Nina album)|Heaven]]'', alongside her [[Heaven (Nina Girado song)|first single of the same title]].<ref name=NSSAbout/> The album was inspired by [[Contemporary R&B]] and [[Pop music]], so as its tracks. "Heaven" was not really a huge hit, though it managed to peak inside the top ten of Philippine charts.
