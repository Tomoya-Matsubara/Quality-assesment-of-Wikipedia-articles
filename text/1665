}}The '''Sheffield and Lincolnshire Junction Railway''' was an early [[United Kingdom|British]] railway company which opened in 1849  between [[Sheffield]] and [[Gainsborough, Lincolnshire|Gainsborough]] and [[Lincoln, Lincolnshire|Lincoln]]. It amalgamated with the [[Sheffield, Ashton-Under-Lyne and Manchester Railway]] and the [[Great Grimsby and Sheffield Junction Railway]], the three being renamed the [[Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway]] in 1847.

==Plans==
The line originated with a plan in 1836 to connect the SA&MR at Sheffield with the proposed [[Midland Counties Railway]] at a time when the latter was planning to run to [[Chesterfield]]. This was changed to proposal for Sheffield Union Railway to connect instead with the [[North Midland Railway]] at Woodhouse Mill. This plan, in turn, was superseded by one for a connection to Chesterfield. At this point, in 1844, it was suggested that the people of Sheffield would be better served by extending the SA&MR eastwards. This was supported, not only by the SA&MR, but by the councillors of [[Retford]] and [[Worksop]]. 

==Authorisation==
The line received approval in 1846, along with the Sheffield and Lincolnshire extension, which was the branch to Lincoln, which would run from near Retford. Parliamentary decree meant that the way from [[Saxilby]] to Lincoln would be shared with the [[Great Northern Railway (Great Britain)|Great Northern]]. The latter built this part of the line and shared it with the S&LE with the agreement that it could have running powers from Retford to Sheffield.

==Construction==
The first board meeting of the amalgamated Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway took place on 6 January 1847. Construction had begun in October 1846 with the section between Sheffield and to what was by then the [[Midland Railway]] at [[Beighton railway station|Beighton]]. The final link in the line between Sheffield and [[Gainsborough Lea Road railway station|Gainsborough]] was completed in 1849 with stations at [[Kiveton Park railway station|Kiveton Park]], [[Shireoaks railway station|Shireoaks]], [[Worksop railway station|Worksop]], [[Retford railway station|Retford]] and [[Sturton le Steeple|Sturton]].
