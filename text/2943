'''Martti Olavi Vainio''' (born [[December 30]] [[1950]] in [[Vehkalahti]]) is a  former [[Finland|Finnish]] long distance runner. In Finland he is recognized as the last of the great runners of famous "V-line", the previous ones being [[Juha V<U+00E4><U+00E4>t<U+00E4>inen]], [[Lasse Vir<U+00E9>n]], and [[Pekka Vasala]]. Each of them won at least one gold medal either at [[Summer Olympics]] or [[European Athletics Championships]] in the 1970's.

His achievements in major athletic championships include gold in the [[10,000 metres]] race [[1978 European Championships in Athletics]] in [[Prague]] and bronze in the same distance at the [[1982 European Championships in Athletics]] in [[Athens]]. At the [[1983 World Championships in Athletics]] he dropped to fourth by a very short margin in the 10,000 metres race, and incensed by that caught the bronze in the [[5000 metres]], which was also a closely contested fixture, Vainio only assuring his medal by a palpable lunge over the finish line.

== Career ==

=== Early career 1972-77 ===

Martti Vainio started systematic training at the age of 20 in the autumn [[1971]] with his coach Aulis Potinkara<ref name=KilpakenttienSankarit>{{cite book | last = Tanhuanp<U+00E4><U+00E4> | first = Asko | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Kilpakenttien sankarit 2 | publisher = [[Tammi (publishing company)|Kustannusosakeyhti<U+00F6> Tammi]] | date = 1993 | location = [[Helsinki]] | pages = 52-55 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 951-30-8903-7}}</ref>. He received his first [[Finnish Championships in Athletics|national championships]] medal in [[1974]] when finishing third in 5000 metres after [[Seppo Tuominen]] and [[Rune Holm<U+00E9>n]]. In the same year he ran his first 10,000 m race with result 29:09.6. He broke the 29-minutes barrier for the first time in [[1976]]. In the same year he was second at the [[Finnish Championships in Athletics]] in 10,000 metres after [[Pekka P<U+00E4>iv<U+00E4>rinta]] and became selected to his first [[1976 Summer Olympics|Olympics]] in [[Montreal]]. However, he did not qualify for [[Athletics at the 1976 Summer Olympics - Men's 10000 metres|10,000 metres]] final, finishing as the second fastest runner to be eliminated from the final (see, for example, Matti Hannus,
"The Montreal Olympic Book" / Montreal Olympiakirja, Helsinki:  "The Runner" / Juoksija Magazine, 1976). He won his first [[Finnish Championships in Athletics|Finnish Championship]] in [[1977]] when beating [[Kaarlo Maaninka]] by 0.9 seconds in 10,000 metres.

=== Years of success 1978-82 ===

Vainio ran intelligently in the [[1978 European Championships in Athletics|1978 European Championships]] 10,000 metres race, spending most of the distance among the lead group's last runners. He only started to rise in the lead group after 8,500 metres. Due to the fast and steady pace, the other runners - some of them presumably better kickers than Vainio - had exhausted themselves, and Vainio only needed to sprint the last lap in 58.4 seconds to win the race. Especially notable was the dropping of [[Brendan Foster]] from the lead to the fourth place in the last 130 metres. His winning time 27:30.99 was fifth at the all-time list of that time and Vainio improved his personal best by 28.7 seconds. Later at the same championships Vainio was sixth in 5,000 metres race. At the [[Track & Field News]] annual world ranking Vainio was second in 10,000 metres after world record breaker [[Henry Rono]] and tenth in 5000 metres.

Because of his international breakthrough Vainio was one of the potential gold medal candidates prior to the [[1980 Summer Olympics]]. Vainio was also known about his tough training programs and during the winter [[1980]] he ran, at the most, over 300 kilometres per week during his four-month long training camp in [[New Zealand]]<ref name=KilpakenttienSankarit/>. Presumably that was too much and due to [[overtraining]] and some unspecified stomach problems, Vainio did not succeed at the [[1980 Summer Olympics]] in [[Moscow]], finishing 13th in the [[Athletics at the 1980 Summer Olympics - Men's 10000 metres|10,000 metres final]] and 11th in the [[Athletics at the 1980 Summer Olympics - Men's 5000 metres|5,000 metres final]].

Despite the disappointment of the Olympic year Vainio returned to the world top and ran very good season in [[1981]] at his best event 10,000 metres. He won [[Bislett Games]] in [[Oslo]] by his second best result so far 27:45.50 and represented [[Europe]] at the [[1981 IAAF World Cup]] in [[Rome]] by finishing fifth with the result 27:48.62. At the [[Track & Field News]] annual world ranking he was fourth after [[Werner Schildhauer]], [[Geoff Smith (athlete)|Geoff Smith]], and [[Mohamed Kedir]].

In the following year [[1982]] Vainio succeeded again at the [[1982 European Championships in Athletics|European Championships]] in [[Athens]] where he won bronze medal after [[Alberto Cova]] and [[Werner Schildhauer]] in 10,000 metres with the excellent time 27:42.51. He competed in 5,000 metres as well and finished 8th. At the [[Track & Field News]] annual world ranking Vainio was seventh in 10,000 metres.

=== World Championships in Helsinki 1983 ===

After the [[1982]] season collaboration of Vainio and Potinkara ended in mutual understanding and Vainio started to plan his training by himself<ref name=KilpakenttienSankarit/>. However, certain people started to influence his training, one among the others was Jouko Elevaara, known as a couch of [[Kaarlo Maaninka]]<ref name=UL>{{cite web | last = Suomen Urheilulehti | first = | authorlink = http://www.urheilulehti.fi | coauthors = | title = N<U+00E4>in siin<U+00E4> k<U+00E4>vi (in Finnish) | work = | publisher = A-lehdet | date = 2004-11-05 | url = http://www.urheilulehti.fi/article117555-1.html | format = | doi = | accessdate = 2009-08-25}}</ref>. According to Vainio's own statement he started to use [[hormone]]s in the autumn 1982 to avoid detrimental effects of [[overtraining]] to his preparation to the [[1983 World Championships in Athletics|first World Championships]] in [[Helsinki]], the capital of his home-country [[Finland]]. According to Vainio, first hormone [[ampulla]]s were retrieved from [[Palermo]] in the autumn 1982.<ref name=UL/>

Vainio succeeded in his preparation to his home championships excellently. [[1983 World Championships in Athletics <U+2013> Men's 10,000 metres|10,000 metres final]] was held in the third day of the Championships. Despite the slow race which culminated in the last lap Vainio finished fourth with time 28:01.37 missing gold medal only by 0.33 seconds and bronze by 0.11 seconds. The home audience was very impressed about his achievement, since they knew very well that he was not at his best in the slow races. Gold medal was won again by [[Alberto Cova]].

[[1983 World Championships in Athletics <U+2013> Men's 5000 metres|5000 metres final]] was held in the final day of the Championships. In his second-best event Vainio surprised Finnish audience with bronze medal. Final metres culminated again to tight competition after overwhelming champion [[Eamonn Coghlan]]. As in the 10,000 metres race, [[Werner Schildhauer]] took the silver beating Vainio by 0.14 seconds. Vainio reached his bronze medal in extraordinary way, he flinged himself in the last 5 metres by falling flat on his face. As a result he won [[Dmitriy Dmitriyev]], who was fourth by 0.04 seconds. Vainio considers this race as the most sentimental event of his career<ref name=KilpakenttienSankarit/>.

After the Championships Vainio competed in [[Weltklasse Z<U+00FC>rich]] and finished fourth in 5000 metres with his personal best 13:20.07. At the [[Track & Field News]] annual world ranking Vainio was fourth in 5000 metres and seventh in 10,000 metres.

=== Doping case at the Olympics 1984 ===

In [[1984]] Vainio started his season by finishing third at the [[Rotterdam Marathon]] with his record time 2:13:04. After the race he gave [[Use of performance-enhancing drugs in sport|doping]] sample in the test being organized by the Finnish Athletics Association. The test did not had official status and it was merely considered as a control test helping to avoid Finnish athletes not to get caught at the tests performed in international championships. Therefore, only the so called A-sample was taken and not the B-sample, which is used to ensure the test result after positive A-sample. However, Vainio's A-sample was tested positive for [[anabolic steroid]]s and the head coach of the Finnish Athletics Federation, Antti Lanam<U+00E4>ki, delegated Timo Vuorimaa, the head coach of long-distance runners, to inform Vainio about the test result. Vuorimaa informed Vainio only by mentioning that there was something strange in his test sample, not providing detailed information about the substance. Vainio believed that he had been using only [[testosterone]] and not anabolic steroids at all. Therefore, his only action was to give up drug use a little bit earlier prior to anticipated tests.<ref name=UL/>

Vainio's track season was really strong. In [[June]] 1984 he competed five times in 5000 metres the weakest result being 13:30.40 and once in 10,000 metres with his all-time second best result 27:41.75. At the [[Bislett Games]] in [[June 28]] he broke [[Lasse Vir<U+00E9>n]]'s Finnish record in 5000 metres and finished second after [[Fernando Mamede]]<ref name = Hannus>{{cite book | last = Hannus | first = Matti | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Kultaiset kent<U+00E4>t, Suomen yleisurheilun vuosisata | publisher = [[Sanoma|Werner Soderstr<U+00F6>m Osakeyhti<U+00F6>]] | date = 1999 | location = [[Juva]]| pages = 187-188 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 951-0-23703-5}}</ref> with the result 13:16.02. In [[July]] he competed only three times; first two times in the [[Finnish Championships in Athletics|Finnish Championships]] 6-8 July in [[Kajaani]] where he took the gold medals after solo runs both in 5000 metres (13:24.99) and 10,000 metres (28:06.85), and third time  when improving his 3000 metres record to 7:44.42 in [[Varkaus]], [[July 12]]. According to Vainio's interview in [[2004]] he took his next [[Injection (medicine)|injection]] after the [[Rotterdam Marathon]] around [[July 10]] and he was sure that this time period will be long enough to allow [[Testosterone#Metabolism|metabolism]] to take its effect and ensure him to give negative test at the [[1984 Summer Olympics|Olympics]]<ref name=UL/>.

[[Athletics at the 1984 Summer Olympics - Men's 10000 metres|10,000 metres final]] was run in [[August 6]]. Vainio took the lead after 5700 metres and only [[Alberto Cova]] was able to follow him. When the final lap started these two runners were well over 100 metres ahead of the other runners. This time, hovewer, Vainio was not able to challenge [[Alberto Cova|Cova]] who took the gold with the time 27:47.54 and Vainio silver with the time 27:51.10. Far behind, [[Mike McLeod]] was third in the finish line with the time 28:06.22. Vainio qualified also to the [[Athletics at the 1984 Summer Olympics - Men's 5000 metres|5000 metres final]] but he was not allowed to start that race anymore because his doping sample after 10,000 metres final was tested positive for [[Metenolone]], a long acting [[anabolic steroid]].

Especially in [[Finland]] Vainio's positive test result was big scandal and provoked public indignation. Although, Vainio's positive doping test after [[Rotterdam Marathon]] was unofficial because of missing B-sample public pressure forced the Finnish Athletics Association to disqualify all Vainio's results after Rotterdam and to discharge Antti Lanam<U+00E4>ki from his duties. Vainio himself did not wanted to provide detailed information about the event, probably partly because he was himself still investigating reasons for positive test result. Finnish [[mass media]] demanded explanation and one story released to the public alleged that Vainio's training partner, the janitor Alpo Nyr<U+00F6>nen had given Vainio a [[hormone]] injection by accident, instead of the intended [[Vitamin B]] injection. Vainio himself released the explanation about the confusion between [[anabolic steroid]]s and [[testosterone]] only several years after the accident.

There are still some speculations and controversies around the [[Athletics at the 1984 Summer Olympics - Men's 10000 metres|Olympics 10,000 metres race]]. [[Alberto Cova]] has confessed the use of [[blood doping|blood transfusion]] in his career and therefore [[Mike McLeod]], originally third in the finish line claim he should be awarded with the gold medal<ref>{{cite web | last = Turnbull | first = Simon | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Athletics: McLeod: When we were the run kings | work = | publisher = [[The Independent]] | date = 2006-10-01 | url = http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/general/athletics-mcleod-when-we-were-the-run-kings-418262.html | format = | doi = | accessdate = 2009-08-26}}</ref>. However, Vainio considers himself as a second best runner in the [[Athletics at the 1984 Summer Olympics - Men's 10000 metres|10,000 metres race]] for the end of his life<ref name=KilpakenttienSankarit/>.

Although the Finnish Athletics Association disqualified all of the Vainio's results from the summer 1984 he was anyway internationally recognized. At the [[Track & Field News]] annual world ranking he was fourth in 10,000 metres and eighth in 5000 metres.

=== Return to the tracks 1986-88 ===

Initially Vainio received a life-long ban from competitive [[track and field athletics|athletics]], but after the Finnish Athletics Association made a plea for a reprieve, it was shortened to 18 months. In [[1986]] Vainio returned to the track and ran 10,000 metres at the [[Bislett Games]] 27:44.57. At the [[1986 European Athletics Championships|European Championships]] he placed seventh in the [[1986 European Athletics Championships <U+2013> Men's 10000 metres|10,000 metres final]] with his time 28:08.72 and sixth in the [[1986 European Athletics Championships <U+2013> Men's 5000 metres|5000 metres final]] with the time 13:22.67. At the [[Track and Field News]] annual world ranking Vainio was sixth in 10,000 metres.

In [[1987]] Vainio concentrated on 10,000 metres and ran 27:42.65 in [[Helsinki]], [[2 July]]. At the [[1987 World Championships in Athletics|World Championships 10,000 metres race]] ended in farce. The first half of the race was slow, 5000 metres lap time being only 14:13.07. At 5800 metres [[Paul Kipkoech]] changed pace and left other runners behind. [[Francesco Panetta]], [[Salvatore Antibo]], and Vainio started their pursuit a little bit later and were not able to properly challenge Kipkoech. Subsequently Kipkoech was far ahead of other runners and the officials decremented the lap table, which displays the remaining laps to the runners, immediately after Kipkoech passed the finish line after each round. As a result, Vainio and some other runners became confused about the remaining laps and started their sprint 400 metres too early and finished the race after 9600 metres. Some runners continued the race after their "first finish", but Vainio was too tired to realize the situation. Vainio also competed in [[1987 World Championships in Athletics <U+2013> Men's Marathon|Marathon]] but after a fairly good start he did not finish.<ref name=Rooma87>{{cite book | last = Pekola | first = Tapio | authorlink = | coauthors = Hannus, Matti | title = Rooma 87 | publisher = Juoksija-lehti | date = 1987 | location = [[Helsinki]] | pages = 56-67 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 951-9465-12-X}}</ref> At the [[Track & Field News]] annual world ranking Vainio was recognized as a seventh best runner in 10,000 metres.

In [[1988]] Vainio ran 10,000 metres in 28:02.04 at the [[Bislett Games]], but that was not enough to convince the [[Finnish Olympic Committee]] and he was not selected to [[1988 Summer Olympics|Olympics]] anymore.

=== Masters World Records 1991 ===

Vainio returned to the tracks once again in [[1991]]. He ran age group M40 [[Masters athletics (track and field)|Masters]] world record in 3000 meters 8:05.08 in [[Mikkeli]], [[12 June]]. Later he improved also 10,000 metres world record 28:30.88 at the [[Fanny Blankers-Koen Games]] in [[Hengelo]], [[25 June]]. At the World Masters Athletics Championships in [[Turku]] he won M40 10,000 metres with the result 29:16.88.<ref name=KilpakenttienSankarit/>

== Trivia ==

During his career (1974-91) Vainio competed 80 times in 10,000 metres. He ran 68 times below 29-minute barrier, 24 times below 28:10, and 10 times below 28 minutes.<ref name=Hannus/>

Vainio's winning time at the [[1978 European Championships in Athletics|1978 European Championships]] in [[Prague]] - 27.30.99 - is still the Finnish record and [[List of European Athletics Championships records|European Championship record]].

Vainio's 10,000 metres time 28:30.58 in [[1991]] is still the World record of the age group M40.<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Records Outdoor Men | work = | publisher = [[World Masters Athletics]] | date = 2009-07-06 | url = http://www.world-masters-athletics.org/records/outdoor-men | format = | doi = | accessdate = 2009-08-29}}</ref>

Vainio achieved five [[Finnish Championships in Athletics|Finnish Championships]] in 5000 metres (1978, 1980, 1981, 1982, and 1987) and eight in 10,000 metres (1977, 1978, 1980, 1981, 1982, 1983 1986, and 1987). He won Finnish Championship in the [[cross country running]] four times in 1981, 1983, 1986 and 1987.<ref>{{cite web | last = Tilastopaja Oy| first = | authorlink = http://www.tilastopaja.org | coauthors = | title = Martti Vainio's profile | work = | publisher = [[Tilastopaja]] | date =  | url = http://www.tilastopaja.org/db/fi/atm.php?ID=6939 | format = | doi = | accessdate = 2009-08-29}}</ref>
