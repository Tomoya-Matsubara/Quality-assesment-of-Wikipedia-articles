'''''BioForge''''' (working title: ''Interactive Movie 1'') is an [[adventure game]] developed by [[Origin Systems]] and published by [[Electronic Arts]] for [[DOS]]. The game was marketed as a movie-like production, because of its in-depth [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] and extensive [[Voice actor|voice acting]] (with 22 different voice actors for characters and computer voices). The game was [[software localization|localized]] in four languages: [[English language|English]], [[German language|German]], [[French language|French]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] (screen text and subtitles only).

The game was very hardware-demanding in [[1995 in video gaming|1995]], requiring 8 MB of RAM and a [[80486|486]] CPU running at 33&nbsp;MHz at least, due to its use of texture-mapped, detailed 3D models and a software renderer (hardware [[3D accelerator]]s were not yet common).

Well received, but also going low on sales, it is considered by many to be an overlooked game and is featured prominently at the [[Home of the Underdogs]]<ref>{{cite web | title=Home of the Underdogs: BioForge | work=BioForge has "Top Dog" status at [[Home of the Underdogs]] | url=http://homeoftheunderdogs.net/game.php?id=126 | accessdate=2011-12-22 }}</ref> and has had generally favorable reviews.<ref>[http://www.allgame.com/cg/agg.dll?p=agg&sql=1:5326~T1 allgame ((( Bioforge > Review )))] - {{Rating|4.5|5}}</ref><ref>[http://www.csoon.com/issue5/bioforge.html Bioforge - PC Review - Coming Soon Magazine!] - 91%</ref><ref>[http://www.justgamesretro.com/PC/bioforge.html Just Games Retro - Bioforge] - 71%</ref>

==Story==

[[File:Bioforge.png|thumb|left|The title screen showing Lex and a sentry robot.]]In the far future, the known universe is ruled by an organization known as 'the Reticulum'. There is also an opposite fanatical group of religious [[extremism|extremists]] known as the Mondites, who believe in the [[evolution]] of man through machine by cybernetic implants, aspire to galactic conquest under the direction of their insane leader, the Prime Paragon.

Years ago, a Reticulum ship called ''Ambassadoria'' made contact with an ancient spaceship containing alien remains in stasis. One alien was transferred to the ship for examination. However it returned to life and destroyed everything until the ship self-destructs, after her captain recorded a log. The Mondites however received the distress call before the Reticulum could be notified; through studying the black box and the remains, they finally discover the aliens' homeworld, a moon which they name Daedalus (named after the [[Daedalus|Greek myth]]) in a remote sector of the galaxy and establish a base while investigating the ruins the aliens left behind; a sentient race known as the Phyxx who were long thought to be [[Extinction|extinct]].

To their end, the Mondites abduct people and subject them on Daedalus for their experiments.  A [[mad scientist]] called Dr. Mastaba who is the base [[commander]] and head of the "ABA Project" ([[assassination|Assassin]] Biologically Augmented) conducts these experiments under the guise of scientific research, mutilating the bodies of his victims in an attempt to turn them into the ultimate killing machine. However, everyone so far has ended up either [[death|dead]] or [[insanity|insane]].

Using [[technology]] borrowed from the Phyxx, the Mondites have finally succeeded in their experiments. But when one of the aliens is accidentally revived from [[suspended animation]] in its [[tomb]], it goes on a rampage through the complex, damaging the [[Nuclear reactor|reactor]] and killing half of the base personnel in the process.

The player takes on the role of a randomly identified [[cyborg]] based on how the player responds to various events in the game.<ref>The character is identified as Lex in the game's ''README.TXT'' but his true identity is revealed in game when using Doctor Escher's medical code to access the data in the surgery room http://il.youtube.com/watch?v=8hYz8xLnQvQ&feature=channel  check minute 2:38 of video.</ref> (''Experimental Unit AP-127'') who awakens in a [[prison#Prison design and facilities|cell]] on Daedelus with no prior [[memory|memories]]. After escaping the cell, the player seems to be one of the scant survivors of the incident that has devastated the station. He must unravel the truth about himself, the research station, the bizarre Mondite [[cult]] that controls it, and the mysterious ancient alien race that once inhabited the moon.

The game ends rather abruptly after the player escapes Daedalus in an experimental [[spacecraft]] in the wake of the moon's destruction, escorted by several Phyxx Blockships. A [[sequel]] (''BioForge II'') was designed and the team were working on the art when the project was halted and changed to an extension of the original game.<ref name="BillArmintrout">{{cite web | last=Armintrout | first=Bill | title=Who is Bill Armintrout | work= | url=http://theminiaturespage.com/twga/bill.mv#cgames | accessdate=2006-05-22}}</ref> The extension, however, was also cancelled and subsequently never published.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Bioforge examplequote.png|thumb|left|An in-game quote showing the dark nature of the game when the player chooses to kill a guard whose life can be spared.]]''BioForge'' centers mainly on exploration and puzzle solving using items, and also on fighting and interaction with [[Non-player character|NPCs]]. The ultimate goal of the game is not obvious at the beginning, since the player is unaware of his identity, which depends on his actions during the game. The player has full control over the main character's actions. This was a deliberate idea of Ken Demarest and Jack Herman. Richard Garriott helped kick off the Interactive Movie theme. In a 1994 magazine article he said that "Interactive Movies have become a [[buzzword]], so it's being applied to games which really aren't. Just because a game has [[Full motion video|FMV]] that doesn't automatically make it an interactive movie, because you have very little control over the actor. Neither is a game in which you click on an icon, then sit back and watch a scene take place." <ref>{{cite web | author=Cochrane, Nathan| year=1994| title=BIO FORGE by Origin Systems | work=Game Bytes Magazine (Issue 21) | url=http://www.ibiblio.org/GameBytes/issue21/flooks/bioforge.html | accessdate=2006-05-16}}</ref>

The player character can rotate left and right, walk and run forwards and backwards, and sidestep. The player can also enter a combat stance that makes several [[Punch (strike)|punch]] and [[kick]] movements and hand-to-hand weapons (if carried) available. Combat can be awkward and has somewhat of a learning curve since enemies must be faced at the correct rotation angle for attacks to connect. Also, since camera angles are fixed, the view can change in an unpredictable manner if the player crosses scene-thresholds during the fight, a gameplay problem first seen in ''[[Alone in the Dark (series)|Alone in the Dark]]''.

The body of the player character houses an exchangeable (and depletable) battery that powers various body functions put there by the experimenters. Functions include a regeneration system that heals all damage when activated, as well as a powerful [[projectile]] weapon (known as the ''PFD Prototype''). Upgrading and swapping the battery is key to the player's progress at certain points in the game. The player can also don a protective armoured suit that enables him to survive the harsh atmosphere outside the facility and explore the archaeological dig.

Various objects, such as data-logs or healing packs, can be picked up and stored in an [[inventory]]. Selected objects are shown as if carried in the left hand of the player character. Several hand-to-hand and ranged weapons, as well as [[battery (electricity)|batteries]] and other large or one-use objects, can also be picked up during the course of the game, but only one can be carried, using the right hand, and they can not be stored in the inventory.

Much of the game's backplot is revealed by finding and reading logs on [[Personal data assistant|PDAs]] and notes left behind by characters, including accounts of experimental subjects losing their memories and lapsing into insanity. As the plot progresses, the main character automatically updates his own diary/log summarizing what he has discovered and what has happened for the player to review, an event marked by a sound cue. [[File:Bioforge reactor entrance.png|thumb|right|''Lex'' entering the time-critical reactor chamber puzzle in the protective armoured suit.]] A large portion of the puzzle element relies on accessing control and [[computer terminal]]s in order to remotely control robots, open doors and bypass security systems. The puzzles are realistic and well integrated with the plot, so several have a time limit.

==Development==
''BioForge'' was [[Game development|developed]] at [[Origin Systems|Origin]] by a core team of ten people under the direction of Lead Programmer/Director [[Ken Demarest]], during a period of two years from February, [[1993 in video gaming|1993]] to March, [[1995 in video gaming|1995]]. The game was developed using [[C++]] and [[80x86]] [[assembly language|assembly]] and used the [[Phar Lap (company)|Phar Lap]] [[DOS extender]]. Internally, the game used a custom [[script language]] for world management and animation. It also employed an [[HTML]]-like language to code the in-game interface.<ref name="demarest">{{cite web | title=Ken Demarest Technical Resum<U+00C3><U+00A9> | work= | url=http://ken.demarest.com/resume/KenDemarestTechnical.htm | accessdate=2006-03-09 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20030210035151/http://ken.demarest.com/resume/KenDemarestTechnical.htm |archivedate = February 10, 2003}}</ref>

The animations were created using the [[rotoscope]] technique on live-actor movements captured with the ''Flock of Birds'' on-body [[motion detector]] system, using an in-house pose editor named ''System for Animating Lifelike Synthetic Actors'' ('''S.A.L.S.A.''') that was capable of displaying captured movement as fully rendered models in [[Real-time computing|real time]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Flock of Birds product page | work= | url=http://www.ascension-tech.com/products/flockofbirds.php | accessdate=2006-04-15 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060314234316/http://www.ascension-tech.com/products/flockofbirds.php |archivedate = March 14, 2006}}</ref>

Regarding the development of BioForge, Ken Demarest said:{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}
{{cquote| Every aspect of the BioForge was designed with technology in mind. You are on a lonely planet because we could not show more than two to three characters on screen at a time. Your body has been operated on because the fledgeling skeletal animation technology was too stiff to show smooth human animation.

Developing BioForge was a struggle. The first year and a half I ran the team (and made plenty of management mistakes) taking on every type of high risk, fascinating technology challenge. Kudos to Lance Grooms, Brendan Segraves and Jamie Rood for putting up with my hard-driving, technology-centric, no-decent-planning style of management!

The programming team has a lot to be proud of with BioForge. We built our own Flock of Birds suit and had real time motion capture years before other companies. To my knowledge, BioForge had the first single-skin, fully texture mapped, skeleton-based characters ever seen in a video game (Alone in the Dark used hash textures and convex body pieces, which did not look nearly as good). }}

==Technical details==
[[File:Bioforge damage screenshot.gif|thumb|The character's appearance changes according to damage]]
''BioForge'' uses a software-only 3D engine to draw polygonal objects and characters against pre-rendered backdrops with a fixed resolution of 320x200 [[pixels]] in [[8-bit color|256 colors]]. In this respect, the game is very similar to the successful ''[[Alone in the Dark (series)|Alone in the Dark]]'' series of games which used hand drawn backgrounds. There are other striking similarities, like the movement scheme incorporating a separate combat mode. The combat element is toned down in ''BioForge'' with respect to the ''Alone in the Dark'' series, especially the later titles.

Other elements similar to ''Alone in the Dark'' are the gory atmosphere and scenery, although ''BioForge'' is actually [[Science fiction|sci-fi]], the logs and narrations one finds, the lonely and devastated scenery, populated only by enemies, deranged lunatics and dead bodies, is something that boosts this feeling.

Other technical details also worthy of note are:
* As a character gets more and more injured in combat, wounds and [[blood]] appear on the model, which will also limp or move awkwardly, indicating its overall health (effects that diminish while the players regains health).
* Laser [[Blaster (weapon)|blaster]] beams deflect intelligently off [[metal]] surfaces in scenes, often bouncing multiple times before dissipating.
* ''BioForge'' pioneered quaternion-based [[skeletal animation]], with pose interpolation and interchangeable skeletons.<ref name="demarest"/> This would later become a common technique in 3d computer and video games.

==Expansions and Possible Sequels==
''BioForge Plus'' was projected by [[Origin Systems|Origin]] as an extension to the original game, which would directly continue the plot, but it was cancelled after a rushed [[Development stage#Beta|beta]] was completed in 10 weeks.<ref name="BillArmintrout" /> A former Origin employee noted that the company was going through a "hard year" in 1995 and that job and production team cuts resulted in the cancellation of ''BioForge Plus''.<ref>{{cite web | title=My Origin Systems Experience | work=The Dark Box: The Soul Cage | url=http://home.austin.rr.com/salters/03-26-2001.htm | accessdate=2006-05-17 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20041216180906/http://home.austin.rr.com/salters/03-26-2001.htm |archivedate = December 16, 2004}}</ref> The cancellation may also presumably have been related to ''BioForge'''s weak sales.

This extension was advertised in promotional electronic catalogs bundled with other games of the company, with this blurb:<ref>{{cite web | title=Trivia for BioForge | publisher=[[MobyGames]] | url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/dos/bioforge/trivia | accessdate=2007-01-19}}</ref>

{{cquote| The work of research archaeologists has been interrupted by the machinations of the scheming scientist who plans to use the advanced alien technology for his own ends. Only your advanced skills give you any hope of survival.

As the moon, Daedalus, explodes, you discover the Black Raven - a ship sent by the Ministry of Security to spy on the Mondite base. It's going to be that kind of day - it's a good thing you're still angry. The adventure is far from over<U+2026>

Features:
* Automatic Tracker - shows locations of most enemy lifeforms
* Better Energy Source
* More Powerful Weapons
* Improved Combat
* New, Superior Ship
* Gauntlet Feature }}

Rock, Paper, Shotgun blog reported that [[EA Mythic]] received a crate full of old Origin Systems archive materials, possibly containing ''BioForge Plus'' source code.<ref>{{cite web | title=Project: Origin (No, Not That One) | url=http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2008/08/14/project-origin-no-not-that-one/ | work=Rock, Paper, Shotgun | accessdate=2008-08-15}}</ref>

==Compatibility with modern systems==
''BioForge'' is not compatible with modern operating systems such as [[Windows XP]] but can be run reliably in the [[DOSBox]] PC emulator as of version 0.65.<ref>[http://dosbox.sourceforge.net/comp_list.php?showID=1270&letter=B&search=BioForge BioForge on DOSBox]</ref> Another way to run the game successfully is through a [[virtual machine]] running DOS.

In October 2012, the digital distributer [[GOG.com]] rereleased the game compatible with modern Windows operating systems. <ref> [http://www.gog.com/en/gamecard/bioforge Bioforge for download - GOG>com]</ref>
