'''''Quai des Orf<U+00E8>vres''''' is a [[1947 in film|1947]] [[Cinema of France|French]] [[crime film|crime]] [[drama film]] based on the book ''L<U+00E9>gitime d<U+00E9>fense'' by [[Stanislas-Andre Steeman]]. Directed by [[Henri-Georges Clouzot]] the film stars [[Suzy Delair]] as Jenny Lamour, [[Bernard Blier]] as Maurice Martineau, [[Louis Jouvet]] as Inspector Antoine and [[Simone Renant]] as Dora.  The film features Jenny Lamour as a music hall singer who aspires for stardom and allows old men who ogle her. This causes Jenny's husband Maurice Martineau to become jealous. One fan of Jenny's is a wealthy financial backer invites to his expansive mansion. Armed with a gun, Maurice goes to the estate to confront his rival but discovers that he is murdered. Afterwords Inspector Antoine gets involved with the case to find the real murderer.

The film was Clouzot's third directoral effort after the controversy of his previous film ''[[Le corbeau]]'' which slowed down his filming schedule. Without having the novel on hand, Clouzot and [[Jean Ferry]] based the film on memory and deviated from the original story. The film was released in France and was popular with both audiences and critics. On the film's re-release in the United States in 2002, it continued to issue praise from critics as one of directors best films.

== Plot ==
Jenny Lamour (Delair) wants to succeed in the theatre. Her husband and accompanist is Maurice Martineau (Blier), a mild-mannered but jealous man. When he finds out that Jenny has been making eyes at Brignon, a lecherous old businessman, in order to further her career, he loses his temper and threatens Brignon with death. Despite this, Jenny goes to a secret rendezvous at Brignon's apartment, who is murdered the same evening. The criminal investigations are led by [[Inspector]] Antoine (Jouvet).

==Production==
''Quai des Orf<U+00E8>vres'' was directed by [[Henri-Georges Clouzot]] and was his first film in four years of inactivity. Clouzot has been previously banned from film making after the controversy after the release ''[[Le corbeau]]'' and due to Clouzot's collaboration with the German-owned company Continental Films.<ref name="cobreaudvd">{{cite DVD-notes |title=Le Corbeau |titlelink=Le Corbeau |titleyear=1942 |director=Henri-Georges Clouzot |format=Back cover |publisher=[[The Criterion Collection]] |location=New York City, United States |publisherid=227 |year=2004}}</ref><ref name="BTI">{{cite video

}}</ref> During Clouzot's inactivity, he wrote scripts for films that were never released. He met with producer Anatole Eliacheff who offered to financially back Clouzot's next film provided that it would be a commercial film. Clouzot suggested the Belgian murder mystery ''L<U+00E9>gitime d<U+00E9>fense'' ({{lang-en|Self-Defense}}) by [[Stanislas-Andr<U+00E9> Steeman]] which he had read during the Occupation. This production was meant to be a commission to end Clouzot's four years of enforced inactivity and take advantage of the new popular style of crime literature. Clouzot had previously written screenplays based on Steeman's work including [[Georges Lacombe (film director)|Georges Lacombe]]'s ''Le Dernier des six'' (1943) and his own debut, ''[[L'Assassin habite au 21]]''. Eliacheff agreed and shortly after sold the rights to another producer, Roger de Venloo.<ref name="prodNotes">{{cite web

When trying to find a copy of ''L<U+00E9>gitime d<U+00E9>fense'' to re-read, Clouzot found that it was out of print. Clouzot wrote a letter to the Steeman to obtain a copy and began to adapt the story from memory with writer [[Jean Ferry]]. By the time a copy of the book arrived, Clouzot and Ferry had already written the script which deviated greatly from Steeman's novel. The changes in the script include the identity of the real murderer, the settings of the action, and the introduction of the lesbian photographer character Dora Monier.<ref name="prodNotes" /><ref name="Mayne88">Mayne 2007, p.88</ref>

''Quai des Orf<U+00E8>vres'' was also a comeback film for director-actor [[Louis Jouvet]] who Clouzot had become good friends with before [[World War II]]. Jouvet accepted the part of Inspector Antoine on the condition that a flexible shooting schedule would be allowed and that Clouzot would cast some of Jouvet's troupe members in the film. Clouzot agreed and cast [[Leo Lapara]] as one of Antoine's colleagues and Fernand Ren<U+00E9> as the music hall director.<ref name="prodNotes" /> Clouzot cast [[Charles Dullin]] as  Brignon, the murder victim. It would be the last film appearance for Dullin, who died in 1949. The main female lead was written for [[Suzy Delair]] who was Clouzot's romantic partner at the time of filming. The film went into production on February 3, 1947 and finished filming on May 10.<ref name="prodNotes" />

Modern reception of the film has also been positive. French critics have continued to priase the film since it's release. In 1964 [[Jean Mitry]] wrote that the film is "one of the few films -- with Renoir's ''[[Rules of the Game]]'', ''[[All About Eve]]'', and two or three others --which allows us to think that the cinema, like the novel and the theater,can some day be an instrument for exploring the human soul."<ref name="prodNotes" /> In 1986, Michel Perez wrote a review for ''[[Le Matin de Paris]]'' stating that ''Quai des Orf<U+00E8>vres'' "was nothing less than the most powerful, best constructed, best written, best directed and most telling film about society of its day."<ref name="prodNotes" /> In 1995, a critics poll in the French film magazine ''[[Positif (magazine)|Positif]]'' placed ''Quai des Orf<U+00E8>vres'' as the second greatest French thriller of all time.<ref name="Lloyd63">Lloyd 2007, p. 63</ref> The film ranking website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported that 100% of critics had given the film positive reviews, based upon a sample of 30.<ref name="rottentomatoes">{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/jenny_lamour/ |title=Quai des Orf<U+00E8>vres - Rotten Tomatoes | accessdate=Narch 11, 2010 |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] | publisher=IGN Entertainment, Inc}}</ref> At [[Metacritic]], which assigns a [[Standard score|normalized]] rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the film has received an [[weighted mean|average]] score of 89, based on 10 reviews.<ref name="metacritic" />
