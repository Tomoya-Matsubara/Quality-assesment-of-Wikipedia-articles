'''State Route 174''' (SR&nbsp;174) is a {{convert|40.66|mi|km|2|adj=on}} long [[State highways in Washington|state highway]] that traverses [[Douglas County, Washington|Douglas]], [[Grant County, Washington|Grant]] and [[Lincoln County, Washington|Lincoln]] counties in [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]]. SR&nbsp;174 begins at a junction with {{nowrap|[[Washington State Route 17|SR 17]]}} in [[Leahy, Washington|Leahy]] and travels eastward to [[Grand Coulee, Washington|Grand Coulee]], near the [[Grand Coulee Dam]], to intersect {{nowrap|[[Washington State Route 155|SR 155]]}}. From Grand Coulee, the roadway travels southeast to end at {{nowrap|[[Washington State Route 21|SR 21]]}} northwest of [[Wilbur, Washington|Wilbur]].

Prior to the establishment of SR&nbsp;174 in a [[1964 highway renumbering (Washington)|1964 renumbering]], it had been county roads and two highways, '''Secondary State Highway&nbsp;10B''' ('''SSH&nbsp;10B''') and '''Secondary State Highway&nbsp;4C''' ('''SSH&nbsp;4C''') from 1937 until 1964. The two highways merged to form SR&nbsp;174 in 1964 and a branch of SSH&nbsp;10B became the [[#Spur routes|Crown Point spur]] of SR&nbsp;174. A second [[spur route]], located in Leahy, was added in 2009.

==Route description==

SR&nbsp;174 begins at an intersection with {{nowrap|[[Washington State Route 17|SR 17]]}} in [[Leahy, Washington|Leahy]], a small [[Unincorporated area|community]] in [[Douglas County, Washington|Douglas County]]. The western terminus is only accessible from SR&nbsp;17 southbound, access from SR&nbsp;17 northbound is provided by the Leahy spur of SR&nbsp;174. From Leahy, the highway travels northeastward through grasslands with few farms before turning southeast to intersect its Crown Point spur near the [[Grand Coulee Dam]]. The roadway then enters [[Grant County, Washington|Grant County]] and the city of [[Grand Coulee, Washington|Grand Coulee]] and becomes the Bridgeport Highway. SR&nbsp;174 continues to the Grand Coulee Dam federal reservation and state maintenance ends through the area.<ref name="rcw"/> After the gap in maintenance in Grand Coulee, SR&nbsp;174 travels over the Columbia Basin Canal and intersects with {{nowrap|[[Washington State Route 155|SR 155]]}}, which is named Midway Avenue through Grand Coulee. After the intersection, the highway is named Grand Coulee Avenue and passes Grand Coulee Middle School and Skilskin High School before leaving the city and the county.<ref name="grandcouleems">{{cite web |url=http://www.gcdsd.wednet.edu/MiddleSchool/middleSchool.asp |title=Grand Coulee Dam Middle School |author=Grand Coulee Dam School District |year=2010 |accessdate=7 November 2010}}</ref><ref name="skilskin">{{cite web |url=http://washington.schooltree.org/public/Skilskin-High-092447.html |title=Skilskin High School |author=Schooltree.org |year=2010 |accessdate=7 November 2010}}</ref> The roadway enters [[Lincoln County, Washington|Lincoln County]] and continues southeast to its eastern terminus, an intersection with {{nowrap|[[Washington State Route 21|SR 21]]}}, northwest of [[Wilbur, Washington|Wilbur]]; SR&nbsp;21 continues south to intersect with {{nowrap|[[U.S. Route 2 in Washington|U.S. Route 2]]}} (US&nbsp;2).<ref name="map">{{Google maps |title=State Route 174 |url=http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&source=s_d&saddr=WA-17+N&daddr=47.770877,-118.722596&hl=en&geocode=FdIu2wIdJTni-A%3B&mra=mi&mrsp=1,0&sz=18&sll=47.770855,-118.722875&sspn=0.001395,0.003449&ie=UTF8&ll=47.881355,-119.078064&spn=0.356433,0.883026&z=10 |accessdate=7 November 2010}}</ref>
