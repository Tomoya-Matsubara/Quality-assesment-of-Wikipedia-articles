'''SMS ''Deutschland''''' was the [[lead ship]] of the five [[Deutschland class battleship|''Deutschland''-class]] [[pre-dreadnought]]s of the [[German Empire|German]] [[Kaiserliche Marine|Imperial Navy]]. She was named in honor of Germany (spelled "Deutschland" in German).

==Construction==
Built by [[Friedrich Krupp Germaniawerft|Germaniawerft]] at their shipyards in [[Kiel]], the keel of the ''Deutschland'' was laid down on [[7 November]] [[1904]] and she was launched on [[29 September]] [[1905]]. On completion she was commissioned on [[1 October]] [[1907]] and cost Germany 24.3 million [[German gold mark|''Goldmarks'']]. However, by the time of their commissioning the ''Deutschland'' and her sisterships had been rendered obsolete by the launching of the new "all-big-gun" British battleship [[HMS Dreadnought (1906)|HMS ''Dreadnought'']] in 1906.

''Deutschland'' and her sister ships [[SMS Pommern|''Pommern'']], [[SMS Schlesien|''Schlesien'']], [[SMS Schleswig-Holstein|''Schleswig-Holstein'']], and [[SMS Hannover|''Hannover'']] represented Germany<U+2019>s last pre-dreadnought battleships. They were similar in general type to the [[Braunschweig class battleship|''Braunschweig''-class]] immediately preceding them, although the ''Deutschlands'' were more heavily armored. The practice of fitting a type of intermediate caliber artillery common in other powers' navies was not followed in the German Navy due to the difficulty in controlling the firing and in spotting the fall of shot from three different sizes of guns.

==Design==
===Dimensions and machinery===
''Deutschland'' was 413 feet at the waterline, and 418.66 ft overall. She had a beam of 73 ft and a draft of 27 ft, and displaced 13,993 tons fully laden. ''Deutschland'' was powered by 3 shaft triple expansion engines, which produced 19,000 ihp, and a top speed of 18 knots.

===Armament===
''Deutschland's'' main armament was comprised of four 11 inch guns in twin turrets, one fore and one aft of the superstructure. Her secondary battery was composed of fourteen 6.7 inch guns and twenty-two 3.4 inch guns, all casemated along the length of the ship, concentrated particularly amidships. ''Deutschland'' also mounted six 17.7 inch torpedo tubes. 

===Armor===
''Deutschland'' had an armored belt that was 9 inches thick at its strongest points, those which covered the ship's vitals, and tapered to 4 inches thick in less critical areas, such as the bow and stern. The turrets had 11 inches of armor protection, a full inch thicker than the prededing [[Braunschweig class battleship|''Braunschweig'' class]]. The deck was covered by 3 inches of armor plate.

==Service history==
Like her sisterships, ''Deutschland'' began [[World War I]] in the II Battle Squadron of the [[High Seas Fllet]]. She participated in the [[Battle of Jutland]] in 1916. In 1917, ''Deutschland'' was removed from frontline service and converted into a barracks ship. She was retained by Germany following the end of the First World War, and broken up for scrap in 1922.
