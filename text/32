==Childhood and early career==
Boyd attended Grange Primary School and it was there where his talent was first spotted when the school<U+2019>s headmaster and PE coach, Mr. Cross, selected him to play for the year 6 side, despite only being 7 years old <ref name="echoboydshottingforstars">{{cite news

| date = [[2004-05-15]]
| accessdate = 2006-07-17}}</ref>. While at Grange Primary School, Boyd barely missed a game for his school. He then attended the Hartlepool Manor School of Technology and his talent was once again recognized by the school<U+2019>s headmaster, Alan White, a teacher who had previously taught [[Steve Harper (footballer)|Steve Harper]] and [[Paul Kitson]]. He also played for 5 years with a [[Sunday League]] side called Hartlepool St Francis, where he started off by playing in central defence and helped the team win several trophies in the Teesside Junior Alliance league. Boyd<U+2019>s talent caught the eye of Middlesbrough who sent scouts to watch him. However, they decided against signing him and he signed for Hartlepool instead, the team he and his Dad supported and regularly watched. 

==Hartlepool United==
===Hartlepool Breakthrough===
While at Hartlepool<U+2019>s youth team he quickly impressed the coaching staff of Mick Smith and Billy Horner. Despite only being in the youth team a short amount of time, he was given a shock last minute call up to the first team despite being just 16. Boyd eventually made his debut against [[Shrewsbury Town F.C.|Shrewsbury]] and was immediate success after coming on a substitute and scoring a dramatic last minute goal from the tightest of angles on his debut.<ref name="echoboyd"> {{cite news

| accessdate = 2006-07-17}}</ref> However Boyd<U+2019>s early promise quickly faded as the youngster found himself languishing in the reserves and struggling to make an impact. <ref name="echoboyd">{{cite news

| accessdate = 2006-07-17}}</ref> From the seasons 1999 to 2003 Boyd had started a total of 25 first team matches and made 38 substitute appearances. Despite this, Boyd had only managed to score 15 goals. 
===Under Neale Cooper and Onwards===
Boyd<U+2019>s lack of first team appearances prompted the newly appointed Hartlepool manager [[Neale Cooper]] to loan him to [[Boston United F.C.| Boston United]] in order to gain match practice. During his time at Boston, Boyd won critical acclaim from Boston manager Neil Thompson and played a total of 14 matches scoring 4 goals before returning to Hartlepool<ref name=" bbcbostonboyd">{{cite news

| accessdate = 2006-07-17}}</ref>. Boyd returned 9lb over weight and looked set to leave Hartlepool United after angering Cooper.  When asked about his weight gain, Boyd claimed that he had been eating more to build up his strength but when asked about gym work he said he had not started it yet. .<ref name="guardianboyd">{{cite news

It was rumoured that Hartlepool chairman, [[Ken Hodcroft]], wanted a five figure sum, which at the time seemed steep for an unproven striker and it was thought that Boston were only prepared to pay a four figure sum of around <U+00A3>5,000. <ref name="echoboydshottingforstars">{{cite news

Boyd was then a surprise inclusion in the team to face Stockport and came on as a sub after 45 minutes. The next game away at to [[Grimsby Town F.C.| Grimsby]] saw Boyd get his first start of the season for Pools and score two goals. Boyd kept his place in the team and continued to score for the remainder of the season and notched an impressive 12 goals in 10 starts<ref name="echoboydshottingforstars">{{cite news

[[Image: Boydscores.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Adam Boyd scoring what was to be the Hartlepool United Goal of the Season 2005 against [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.| Sheffield Wednesday]]]]
The following season Boyd became one of the most feared strikers in League 1 and formed a strong partnership with fellow striker [[Joel Porter]]. He scored 29 goals in league and cup and became the club<U+2019>s highest goalscorer since Joe Allon in 1991. The pick of Boyd<U+2019>s goals came against Sheffield Wednesday where Boyd received the ball outside the box and faked his way past two players before chipping a lovely effort over [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.| Sheffield Wednesday]] keeper Gallacher. This goal earned him two awards, Hartlepool United's Goal of the Season 2005 and the North East Goal of the Season 2005<ref name="downingandboydecho">{{cite news

As Boyd gained critical acclaim, his value rocketed to <U+00A3>1 million and he attracted the attention of clubs such as [[Newcastle United F.C.| Newcastle]], [[Liverpool F.C.| Liverpool]], [[Middlesbrough F.C.| Middlesborough]] and [[Sunderland A.F.C.| Sunderland]].<ref name="biggunseyeboyd">{{cite news

Unfortunately, Boyd picked up a long-term injury against Yeovil after bruising his bone. To make matters worse, Boyd<U+2019>s injury treatment went badly as he contracted a blood infection, which resulted him being out for 5 months. <ref name="boydfeaturedplayer">{{cite news

===Luton Town Career===
On [[28th July]] [[2006]], Boyd signed a three-year contract with [[Luton Town]] after Hartlepool accepted a bid in the region of <U+00A3>500,000.<ref name="boydsignsforluton">{{cite news

==Off Field Antics==
Boyd has also become famous for his antics off the pitch after the ex-boyfriend of a woman he was in bed with caught them and assaulted him. Boyd was then forced to flee naked down a posh estate and suffered bruises and injuries to his feet<ref name="guardianboyd">{{cite news
