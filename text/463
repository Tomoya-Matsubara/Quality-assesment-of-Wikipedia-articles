The '''iPhone 5''' is a [[touchscreen]]-based [[smartphone]] developed by [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]. It is the [[List of iOS devices|sixth generation]] of the [[iPhone]] and succeeds the [[iPhone 4S]]. The phone is a slimmer, lighter model that introduces a higher-resolution, 4-inch screen to the series with [[16:9]] widescreen [[display aspect ratio|aspect ratio]]. The phone also includes a custom-designed [[ARM architecture|ARMv7]] processor called the [[Apple A6]], an update to Apple's mobile operating system known as [[iOS 6]], and support for [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]].

Apple held an event to formally introduce the phone on September 12, 2012. After Apple began taking pre-orders on September 14, 2012, over two million were received within 24 hours. Initial demand for the iPhone 5 exceeded the supply available at launch on September 21, 2012, and has been described by Apple as "extraordinary", with pre-orders having sold twenty times faster than its predecessors. After the launch of the device, Samsung filed a lawsuit against Apple, claiming that the iPhone 5 infringes eight of its patents. 

While reception to the iPhone 5 has been generally positive, the new [[Maps (application)|Maps]] application has been negatively received and was reported to contain many serious errors. Several hardware issues have also received criticism from consumers and reviewers, including an unintended purple hue in photos taken by the iPhone 5, an issue with its coating being prone to chipping, and the presence of light leaks on white variants of the device. Incompatibilities with LTE networks in some regions have been noted.

===Litigation===

{{main|Apple Inc. v. Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd.}}
Following the release of the iPhone 5, [[Samsung]] announced that it was filing a lawsuit against Apple for [[Patent infringement|infringing]] eight of its [[patent]]s. The case is scheduled to begin in 2014.<ref name="smh-litigation">{{cite web | url=http://www.smh.com.au/digital-life/mobiles/apples-iphone-5-infringes-patents-samsung-says-20121003-26yc9.html | title=Apple's iPhone 5 infringes patents, Samsung says | publisher=[[Sydney Morning Herald]] | date=October 3, 2012 | accessdate=November 1, 2012 | author=Rosenblatt, Joel}}</ref> In a statement, Samsung said, it had "little choice but to take the steps necessary to protect our innovations and intellectual property rights".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/samsung/9580996/Samsung-sues-Apple-over-iPhone-5.html|title=Samsung sues Apple over iPhone 5|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|date=October 2, 2012|accessdate=October 7, 2012|author=Philipson, Alice}}</ref> Litigation between the two involving patent infringement has been ongoing and is being fought in several court cases around the world. Apple has won preliminary injunctions against the [[Galaxy Nexus]] smartphone co-developed by Samsung. In August 2012, Apple added the [[Samsung Galaxy S III]] to a list of models it also claims infringe its patents.<ref name="Samsung litigation">{{cite web|url=http://www.watoday.com.au/digital-life/mobiles/apples-iphone-5-infringes-patents-samsung-says-20121003-26yc9.html|title=Apple's iPhone 5 infringes patents, Samsung says|publisher=[[WAtoday]]|date=October 4, 2012|accessdate=October 7, 2012|author=Rosenblatt, Joel}}</ref>

==Production==

The components and labor required to construct the most basic iPhone 5 is estimated to cost US$207, which is US$19 more than the cost of components for the corresponding iPhone 4S model. The LTE module in the iPhone 5 alone costs $34, $10 more than the cellular module in the iPhone 4S. Similarly, screens used in the iPhone 5 costs $44, which is $7 more than the screen of its predecessor. [[Mashable]] noted that the profit margin of selling each device is "huge" as the iPhone 5 retails for US$649.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2012/09/19/iphone-5-manufacturing-cost|title=The 16 GB iPhone 5 Costs Apple $207 to Build|publisher=[[Mashable]]|date=September 19, 2012|accessdate=October 7, 2012|author=Fiegerman, Seth}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.isuppli.com/Teardowns/News/Pages/iPhone5-Carries-$199-BOM-Virtual-Teardown-Reveals.aspx|title= iPhone 5 Carries $199 BOM, Virtual Teardown Reveals|publisher=[[iSuppli]]|date=September 18, 2012|accessdate=Nov 11, 2012|author=Andrew Rassweiler}}</ref>

Subsequently after the announcement of the device, a lack of supply of the iPhone 5 was evident. This was due to a shortage of components such as the screen; reports emerged, stating that [[Sharp Corporation|Sharp]] was unable to ship the screen before the debut of the iPhone 5 and other manufacturers reported that it was difficult to keep up with demand. As a result, the number of pre-orders rose due to the uncertainty of stock at retail stores and the delivery dates for pre-orders were postponed to dates that were after the initial release date of the device.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/business/ci_21626528/iphone-5-screen-shortage-causing-apple-production-delays|title=iPhone 5 screen shortage causing Apple production delays, analysts report; stock falls|publisher=[[Mercury News]]|date=September 25, 2012|accessdate=October 7, 2012|author=Owens, Jeremy}}</ref>

===Quality control inspectors strike===

The report stated training was inadequate for quality demands expected and led to employees producing products that did not meet standards. During the strike, conflicts between quality control inspectors and employees resulted in brawls. China Labor Watch also claimed that concerns raised by inspectors were not addressed by factory management.<ref name="Foxconn strike" /> [[Foxconn]] spokesman admitted that a problem in the [[micromanagement]] exists, but also said that there were only 300 to 400 workers absent and the conflicts did not influence production processes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tech.qq.com/a/20121007/000004.htm|title=<U+5BCC><U+58EB><U+5EB7><U+5426><U+8BA4><U+90D1><U+5DDE><U+5DE5><U+5382><U+5927><U+7F62><U+5DE5> <U+627F><U+8BA4><U+5FAE><U+89C2><U+7BA1><U+7406><U+95EE><U+9898> (Chinese)|publisher=[[QQ]]|quote="Foxconn admits that a problem in micromanagement exists", "...a conflict occurred, however only 300-400 workers were absent from the production line and the production process was not affected"|date=October 10, 2012|accessdate=October 7, 2012|author=<U+6797><U+5176><U+73B2>}}</ref> In November 2012, Foxconn chairman, [[Terry Gou]] reported that the delay in production was due to undisclosed difficulties in assembly.<ref name="registernov7">{{cite web | url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/11/07/hon_hai_shipping_fewer_iphone_5s_than_apple_want/ | title='iPhone 5 is so easily scratched we just can't get them out the door' | publisher=The Register | date=November 7, 2012 | accessdate=November 8, 2012 | author=Leach, Anna}}</ref>

Like on iTunes, this feature shows the different album covers in a scroll-through photo library. Scrolling is achieved by swiping a finger across the screen. Alternatively, headset controls can be used to pause, play, skip, and repeat tracks. On the 5, the volume can be changed with the included Apple Earphones, and the Voice Control feature can be used to identify a track, play songs in a playlist or by a specific artist, or create a [[Genius (iTunes)|Genius playlist]].<ref name="music5"/>

Like the iPhone 4S, the iPhone 5 has [[Siri (software)|Siri]],<ref name="music5"/> that allows the user to operate the iPhone by spoken commands. The software was improved in iOS 6 to include the ability to make restaurant reservations, launch apps, dictate Facebook or Twitter updates, retrieve movie reviews and detailed sports statistics.<ref name="Time: Here it comes"/>

On the {{nowrap|iPhone 5}}, [[texting]] can be aided by the voice assistant, which converts speech to text.<ref name="music5"/> In addition to regular texting, messaging on the {{nowrap|iPhone 5}} supports [[iMessage]], a specialized instant messaging program and service that allows unlimited texting to other Apple devices running iOS 5 or later. This supports the inclusion of content such as images and sound in text messages, integration with the device's voice-controlled software assistant, and read acknowledgements for sent messages. Input to the device comes from a keyboard displayed on the multi-touch screen or by voice-to text by speaking into the microphone. Entered text is supported by predictive and suggestion software; there is a multi-language spell-checker which recognises many regional accents of different languages.<ref name="music5"/>

iOS 6 features several new and/or updated apps, which includes [[Apple Maps]] and [[Passbook (application)|Passbook]]. Apple's built-in Maps app, which replaced the former Maps app powered by Google Maps, has been universally derided and lacks many features present in competing maps apps.

All three work on 2G [[GSM]]/[[GPRS]] and 3G [[UMTS]]/[[EDGE]] networks on both the 800 and 1900&nbsp;MHz bands used in the Americas, and the 900 and 1800&nbsp;MHz bands used elsewhere. The CDMA A1429 model works on [[CDMA]] networks, such as that of Sprint and Verizon. Another version supports LTE only on the 1700/2100&nbsp;MHz [[Advanced Wireless Services|AWS]] band, and the 700&nbsp;MHz band recovered after the forced [[DTV transition in the United States|conversion to digital television]] in the US (channels 52 to 56), currently the only network that supports the band is AT&T. GSM A1429 supports several other LTE bands available in other countries, such as LTE bands 1, 3, 5.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.theverge.com/2012/9/12/3321894/apple-iphone-5-separate-gsm-cdma-versions | title=Apple iPhone 5 to be available in separate GSM and CDMA versions | publisher=[[The Verge (website)|The Verge]] | date=September 12, 2012 | accessdate=November 3, 2012 | author=Seifert, Dan}}</ref><ref name="iPhone 5 tech specs" />

===Critical reception===
[[File:Comparison of iPhone dock connectors.jpg|thumb|Comparison between the 30 pin port of the [[iPhone 4S]] and lightning port of the iPhone 5 ]]
The {{nowrap|iPhone 5}} received mainly positive reviews from commentators and reviewers. Tim Stevens from ''[[Engadget]]'' praised the {{nowrap|iPhone 5}} for its high resolution screen surpassing that of the {{nowrap|iPhone 4S}}, which he considered to be one of the best phone screens available on the market. Stevens was critical of the new connector, which is incompatible with devices and cables that use the superseded 30 pin connector, although the ''[[LA Times]]'' reported that this was a change necessary to make the device smaller than its predecessor.<ref name="Rodriguez, Salvador and Chang, Andrea"/> Engadget agreed that Apple fulfilled most of the promises stated on its website, such as "better battery performance", "two times the graphics performance" and "two times faster."<ref name="Engadget iPhone 5 Review">{{cite web|url=http://www.engadget.com/2012/09/18/apple-iphone-5-review|title=iPhone 5 review|publisher=[[Engadget]]|date=September 18, 2012|accessdate=September 19, 2012|author=Stevens, Tim}}</ref> [[David Pogue]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' considered the 4-inch Retina display a "nice but not life-changing change", and praised the Lightning connector for its size, sturdiness, and reversibility, while noting its lack of support for older accessories, remarking that "Apple has a long history of killing off technologies, inconveniently and expensively, that the public had come to love".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/19/technology/personaltech/apples-iphone-5-scores-well-with-a-quibble-review.html?pagewanted=all|title=The iPhone 5 Scores Well, With a Quibble|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=September 18, 2012|accessdate=September 19, 2012|authorlink=Pogue, David|author=David Pogue}}</ref> Technology columnist [[Ed Baig]] of ''[[USA Today]]'' was impressed that Apple had met the public's "lofty expectations" for the iPhone 5 in a competitive market.<ref name="usatodayreview">{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/tech/columnist/edwardbaig/story/2012-09-18/iphone-5-review/57803932/1|title=Review: Apple iPhone 5 in front of the smartphone pack|publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|work=[[USA Today]]|date=September 18, 2012|accessdate=September 22, 2012|authorlink=Ed Baig|author=Baig, Ed}}</ref> In a repair-ability review, [[iFixit]] found the iPhone 5 easier to disassemble and repair than its predecessor.<ref name="ifixit teardown"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/iPhone-4S-Teardown/6610/2|title=iPhone 4S Teardown|publisher=[[iFixit]]|accessdate=October 4, 2012}}</ref>
