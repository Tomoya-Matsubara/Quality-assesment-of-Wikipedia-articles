'''Mucking''' is a hamlet and former [[List of traditional (Church of England) parish churches in Thurrock|Church of England parish]] adjoining the [[Thames estuary]] in southern [[Essex]], [[England]]. It is located approximately 2 miles south of the town of [[Stanford le Hope]] in what is now [[Thurrock]] [[unitary authority]]. 

==Early history==
Mucking was "a particularly extensive Anglo-Saxon settlement, of at least 100+ individuals, commanding an important strategic position in the Lower Thames region; it may have functioned as a meeting place and mart for surrounding areas on both sides of the Thames".<ref name = cemeteries>Sue Hirst and Dido Clark, ''Excavations at Mucking: Volume 3, The Anglo-Saxon Cemeteries'' (Museum of London Archaeology 2009)</ref> Its name is of [[Old English language|Saxon]] origin and indicates human settlement here for well over a [[millennium]]. The meaning is usually given as 'the family (or followers) of Mucca' (Mucca most likely being a local chieftain). However, [[Margaret Gelling]] has suggested alternative interpretations - 'Mucca's place' or 'Mucca's stream'<ref>Margaret Gelling, ''The Place-name Mucking'' (in ''Excavations at Mucking, Volume 2'', English Heritage, 1993, page 96)</ref>. Mucking's geographical location on flat [[marshland]] at the very mouth of the River Thames indicates that settlement in the area by [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] invaders from the Continent probably occurred at a relatively early date; indeed, an outline of a now abandoned nearby Saxon village, West Mucking, was discovered from aerial photographs in the 20th century. 

==Modern Mucking==
Although the population of the hamlet is now less than one hundred, it thrived in [[Victorian era|Victorian]] times, boasting small shops, a large [[rectory]] and the mediaeval church of [[St John the Baptist]] (both of the latter buildings have now been converted to private houses, with access to the church [[graveyard]] possible only with prior written permission). The hamlet also gives its name to Mucking Flats, the [[mudflat]] on the [[estuary]] to the east of the village, one of Essex's [[List of Sites of Special Scientific Interest in Essex|Sites of Special Scientific Interest]] and once the site of a small [[lighthouse]].   

==The Mucking Archeological Excavation==
{{main|The Mucking Excavation}}

Mucking was the location for a major archeological dig ahead of excavation from the gravel quarry that swallowed it up. 
The site was discovered by [[crop marks]] in the soil photographed by [[Kenneth St Joseph|Dr St Joseph]] in 1959. The excavation was directed by Margaret Jones and lasted from 1965 to 1978. In addition to major finds from the Saxon period, other artefacts from the site span the period from the Stone Age through to the medieval period.<ref>M U Jones, ''Mucking and the early Saxon rural settlement in Essex''  (in D G Buckley (Editor), ''Archaeology in Essex to AD 1500'')</ref>

The Saxon settlement excavated at Mucking was extensive with more than 230 buildings. The site contained two cemeteries<ref>Nigel Brown (compiler), ''Splendid and Permanent Pageants'', Essex County Council, 2000</ref>. Many of the buildings were sunken huts although there were timber halls which were possibly occupied by the higher status families. The settlement gradually moved north over the course of two hundred years after its establishment in the fourth century.

==Parish church==
The parish church was dedicated to St John the Baptists. It was largely demolished and rebuilt in the middle of the 19th century.<ref>{{citebook|title=Twenty-two of the churches of Essex architecturally described and illustrated|first=George|last= Buckler|year=1856|page=60}}</ref> It is now redundant and used as private dwelling.<ref name=Barham>Andrew Barham, ''Lost Parish Churches of Essex'' (Ian Henry Publications, 2000</ref>
