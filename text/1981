{{Expand|date=February 2007}}'''Islamic Association of Palestine''' ('''IAP''') was an Islamist organization that raised money in the United States for [[Hamas]]. It purported to write articles of a factual nature on issues that "[[Zionist]] controlled" westernized media failed to report. It called itself "a not-for-profit, public-awareness, educational, political, social, and civic, national grassroots organization dedicated to advancing a just, comprehensive, and eternal solution to the cause of [[Proposals for a Palestinian state|Palestine]] and suffrages of the [[Palestinians]]." For a time it also used the name '''American Muslim Society'''.<ref name=LINK>[http://www.meforum.org/article/916 CAIR: Islamists Fooling the Establishment] The Middle East Quarterly</ref>

*[[Sami Al-Arian]], cofounder of [[Islamic Society of North America]] and supporter of [[Palestinian Islamic Jihad]].

It published a magazine, ''Tareeq Filistine'' ''(Road to Palestine)'', ''Ila Filastin'',<ref name="Emerson2005" /> and newspapers ''Al-Zaytuna'' and ''Muslim World Monitor''.

It had been accused of issuing [[anti-Semitic]] propaganda and having links to terrorists by the [[Anti-Defamation League|ADL]].

The U.S. government considers the IAP a front for [[Hamas]] in the United States.

In December 2004, a federal judge in the U.S. city of Chicago ruled that the IAP (along with the [[Holy Land Foundation]]) was liable for a $156 million dollar lawsuit for aiding and abetting the terror group [[Hamas]] in the death of a 17-year-old David Boim, an American citizen. Though IAP has already had its assets frozen by the U.S. executive branch of the government, this was the first time a U.S. court officially linked IAP to Hamas.<ref name="Emerson2005" /><ref name=LINK/>

The organization was the parent organization of [[Council on American-Islamic Relations]], or CAIR.<ref name="Emerson2005" /><ref>http://web.archive.org/web/20030622094859/http://www.iap.org/contactus.htm IAP Board Of Directors / Shura Council</ref><ref>http://www.washington-report.org/backissues/1099/9910067.html Rafeeq Jaber: An Energetic Muslim Visionary and Fearless Palestinian-American Political Activist</ref><ref name=LINK/>

[[KindHearts]] listed the IPA as its "Fundraiser Organizer" in its tax exemption filings.<ref name="Emerson2005" />
