'''SMS ''Kolberg''''' was a [[light cruiser]] of the German ''[[Kaiserliche Marine]]'' (Imperial Navy) during the [[First World War]], the [[lead ship]] of [[Kolberg class cruiser|her class]]. She had three sister ships, {{SMS|Mainz}}, {{SMS|C<U+00F6>ln|1909|2}}, and {{SMS|Augsburg||2}}. She was built by the [[Schichau-Werke]]; her hull was laid down in early 1908 and she was launched later that year, in November. She was commissioned into the [[High Seas Fleet]] in June 1910. She was armed with a main battery of twelve [[10.5 cm SK L/45 naval gun|10.5&nbsp;cm SK L/45 guns]] and had a top speed of {{convert|25.5|kn|abbr=on}}.

''Kolberg'' saw action in several engagements with the British during the war, including the [[raid on Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby]] in December 1914 and the [[Battle of Dogger Bank (1915)|Battle of Dogger Bank]] the following month. She also saw action against the Russians on two occasions, during the [[Battle of the Gulf of Riga]] in August 1915 and [[Operation Albion]] in November 1917. After the end of the war, she was ceded to France as a [[war prize]] and renamed ''Colmar''. She served only briefly in the French Navy, including a deployment to Asia in 1924. She was stricken in 1927 and broken up two years later.

==Design==
{{main|Kolberg class cruiser}}

''Kolberg'' was ordered under the contract name ''[[Ersatz]]'' {{SMS|Greif||2}} and was laid down in early 1908 at the [[Schichau-Werke]] shipyard in [[Danzig]]. She was launched on 14 November 1908, after which [[fitting-out]] work commenced. She was commissioned into the [[High Seas Fleet]] on 21 June 1910.<ref name=G1067>Gr<U+00F6>ner, pp. 106<U+2013>107</ref> The ship was {{convert|130.5|m|sp=us}} [[length overall|long overall]] and had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|14|m|abbr=on}} and a [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|5.58|m|abbr=on}} forward. She displaced {{convert|4915|MT|abbr=on}} at full combat load. Her propulsion system consisted of two sets of [[Melms & Pfenniger]] [[steam turbine]]s driving four {{convert|2.25|m|adj=on|sp=us}} propellers. They were designed to give {{convert|19000|shp|lk=in}}. These were powered by fifteen coal-fired Marine [[water-tube boiler]]s. These gave the ship a top speed of {{convert|25.5|kn}}. ''Kolberg'' carried {{convert|970|MT|abbr=on}} of coal that gave her a range of approximately {{convert|3250|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|14|kn}}. ''Kolberg'' had a crew of eighteen officers and 349 enlisted men.<ref name=G106>Gr<U+00F6>ner, p. 106</ref>

The ship was armed with twelve [[10.5 cm SK L/45 naval gun|10.5&nbsp;cm SK L/45 guns]] in single pedestal mounts. Two were placed side by side forward on the [[forecastle]], eight were located amidships, four on either side, and two were side by side aft.<ref name=C159>Gardiner & Gray, p. 159</ref> These were replaced in 1916&ndash;1917 with six [[15 cm SK L/45]] guns. She also carried four 5.2&nbsp;cm SK L/55 anti-aircraft guns, though these were replaced with a pair of two 8.8&nbsp;cm SK L/45 anti-aircraft guns in 1918. She was also equipped with a pair of {{convert|45|cm|abbr=on|1}} [[torpedo tube]]s submerged in the hull. Two deck-mounted {{convert|50|cm|abbr=on}} torpedo tube launchers were added in 1918. She could also carry 100 [[naval mine|mines]]. The [[conning tower]] had {{convert|100|mm|abbr=on}} thick sides, and the deck was covered with up to {{convert|40|mm|abbr=on}} thick armor plate.<ref name=G106/>

==Service history==
After her commissioning in 1910, ''Kolberg'' served with the reconnaissance forces of the German fleet.<ref name=G107/> On 14 October 1914, ''Kolberg'' and the minelaying cruiser {{SMS|Nautilus||2}} steamed into the North Sea to lay a minefield off the [[Firth of Forth]], but upon realizing British forces were operating off the [[Dogger Bank]], they broke off the operation and returned to port.<ref>Woodward, p. 29</ref> ''Kolberg''{{'}}s first major action of [[World War I]] was the [[raid on Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby]] on 15&ndash;16 December 1914. She was assigned to the [[II Scouting Group]] with three other light cruisers, tasked with screening for the [[battlecruiser]]s of the [[I Scouting Group]], commanded by Rear Admiral [[Franz von Hipper]].<ref>Tarrant, p. 31</ref> While the battlecruisers were conducting the bombardments of the towns, ''Kolberg'' laid a field of 100 mines off the British coast.<ref>Halpern, p. 41</ref> When the German forces withdrew, the weather became bad enough that Hipper ordered the other light cruisers to steam independently to the rendezvous with the main fleet; ''Kolberg'' had meanwhile joined up with the battlecruisers and proceeded with them.<ref>Tarrant, p. 33</ref> 

A little over a month later, she saw action at the [[Battle of Dogger Bank (1915)|Battle of Dogger Bank]], on 24 January 1915. The engagement began when ''Kolberg'' encountered the British cruiser {{HMS|Aurora|1913|6}}; both ships opened fire, drawing the British and German battlecruiser squadrons to the action.<ref>Halpern, p. 45</ref> ''Kolberg'' quickly scored two hits on ''Aurora'', which replied with two hits of her own. One of the shells struck ''Kolberg'' below the waterline and the other shell hit the ship above the waterline; the hits killed two men.<ref>Tarrant, p. 38</ref> In August 1915, the ship went into the Baltic to participate in the [[Battle of the Gulf of Riga]]. She was assigned to serve as a flotilla leader for three and a half flotillas of torpedo boats, as part of an assault force into the [[Gulf of Riga]].<ref>Halpern, p. 196</ref> On the 10th, she joined the battlecruiser {{SMS|Von der Tann}} to shell the island of [[Ut<U+00F6>, Finland|Ut<U+00F6>]], though numerous reports of [[submarine]]s in the area convinced the Germans to withdraw.<ref>Halpern, p. 197</ref> On either 15 or 16 August 1915, a Russian submarine fired a single torpedo at ''Kolberg'' which missed.<ref>Polmar & Noot, p. 43</ref>

In November 1917, ''Kolberg'' returned to the Baltic, for another attack on the Gulf of Riga, [[Operation Albion]]. By this point, she had been assigned as the [[flagship]] of the [[VI Scouting Group]] along with her sister {{SMS|Augsburg||2}} and {{SMS|Strassburg||2}}. At 06:00 on 14 October 1917, the three ships left [[Liep<U+0101>ja|Libau]] to escort minesweeping operations in the Gulf of Riga. They were attacked by Russian {{convert|12|in|adj=on}} coastal guns on their approach and were temporarily forced to turn away. By 08:45, however, they had anchored off the [[Mikailovsk Bank]] and the minesweepers began to clear a path in the minefields.<ref>Staff, p. 60</ref> Two days later, ''Strassburg'' and ''Kolberg'' joined the [[dreadnought]]s {{SMS|K<U+00F6>nig||2}} and {{SMS|Kronprinz|1914|2}} for a sweep of the Gulf of Riga.<ref>Staff, pp. 102<U+2013>103</ref> In the ensuing [[Battle of Moon Sound]], the battleships destroyed the old [[pre-dreadnought]] [[Russian battleship Slava|''Slava'']] and forced the pre-dreadnought [[Russian battleship Tsesarevich|''Grazhdanin'']] to leave the Gulf.<ref>Staff, pp. 113<U+2013>114</ref> Later that day, ''Kolberg'' moved into the Gulf and engaged a Russian coastal battery at [[Woi]] on [[Muhu|Moon Island]] for ten minutes, starting at 13:35. The Russian guns did not return fire, so ''Kolberg'' ceased firing, and at 14:25, anchored in the [[Kleinen Sound]] with ''Strassburg''. A landing party of forty men was assembled to capture the Russian guns at Woi; they landed on the island at 15:45 and by 17:30, the landing party had captured the guns and rendered them inoperable.<ref>Staff, pp. 119&ndash;120</ref>

By 1918, ''Kolberg'' was reduced to serve as a [[coastal defense ship]]. She was stricken from the [[naval register]] on 5 November 1919, and subsequently surrendered to the French in [[Cherbourg]] on 28 April 1920, under the name "W". She was commissioned in the [[French Navy]] as ''Colmar''.<ref name=G107>Gr<U+00F6>ner, p. 107</ref> In 1924, she was assigned to a colonial tour in Asia, along with the old [[armored cruiser]] [[French cruiser Jules Ferry (1903)|''Jules Ferry'']]. In September 1924, the two French ships contributed to a multi-national landing party of around 1,800 men drawn together due to violence in [[Shanghai]].<ref>Waldron, pp. 53&ndash;54</ref> She remained in French service for only a few years, until she was stricken on 21 July 1927. Ultimately, she was broken up for scrap two years later in [[Brest, France]].<ref>Gardiner & Gray, p. 201</ref>
