'''Gjende''' (or '''Gjendin''') is a [[lake]] in the [[Jotunheimen]] mountains in [[Norway]]'s [[Jotunheimen National Park]]. The [[proglacial lake]] shows typical characteristics of glacial formation, being long and narrow&mdash;in length 18<U+2009>km and in breadth 1.5<U+2009>km at the broadest point with steep walls. Gjende has a characteristic light-green color resulting from the large quantity of [[rock flour]] which is discharged into the Gjende by the [[Muru]] river. The river [[Sjoa]] provides the outlet from Gjende at [[Gjendesheim]], and flows eastward into the [[Gudbrandsdalsl<U+00E5>gen]] river.

Gjende lies in the middle of Jotunheimen National Park and both to the north and south of the lake lie peaks greater than 2,000<U+2009>m. There are numerous staffed tourist cabins maintained by the [[Norwegian Mountain Touring Association]] (DNT); in the west end lies [[Gjendebu]], on the north side lies [[Memurubu]] and on the east end lies Gjendesheim. In the summer boats provide transport between these locations.

==Cultural and literary references== 
Lake Gjende is found in literature and travel books from the 18th century. Together, the [[Jotunheimen]] lakes of Gjende and [[Bygdin]] play in many such descriptions. For example [[Henrik Ibsen]]'s ''[[Peer Gynt]]'' took his famous wild-reindeer ride along "the Gjendin Ridge", a reference to either the narrow Besseggen Ridge - or the Knutsh<U+00F8> ridge on the other side of lake Gjende.

The official name Gjende is taken from the [[Gudbrandsdal]] [[Districts of Norway|traditional district]] dialect used in [[Lom, Norway|Lom]] and [[V<U+00E5>g<U+00E5>]]. In the [[Vang]] dialect the lake is called ''Gjendin'', which is the form you find in [[Henrik Ibsen]]'s name for what is now called [[Besseggen]], formerly ''Gjendineggen'', or ''Gendineggen'' in the older [[orthography]].

The lake gave its name to a famous early outdoors man and free thinker, [[Jo Gjende]] ([[1794]]&mdash;[[1884]]), who had a cabin at Gjende.
