==Artwork==
Melanie Yazzie works a wide range of media that include printmaking, painting, sculpting, and ceramics, as well as [[installation art]].<ref name="wgbh"/> Her art is accessible to the public on many levels, while being witty and colorful.

Her subject matter is significant because the serious undertones reference native [[Postcolonialism|post-colonial]] dilemmas.  Her work often brings images of women from many indigenous cultures to the fore.  Thus her work references [[matrilineal]] systems and points to the possibility of female leadership.

A recurring motif in Yazzie's work has been Blue Bird flour sacks,<ref name="wgbh"/> which provided clothing material during her childhood.

==Professional career==
Yazzie had lead several collaborative international projects, including ones with artists in Siberia, Japan, New Zealand, Australia, Canada, Mexico, and Germany.<ref name="gorman"/>  A recent portfolio, "Hello Kitty and Pocahontas" examined world artists analysis of the commercialization of ethnic identity.
