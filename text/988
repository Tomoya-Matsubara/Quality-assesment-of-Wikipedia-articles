The NDH was founded on 10 April 1941, after the [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] by the Axis powers. The NDH consisted of most of modern day [[Croatia]] and [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], together with some parts of modern-day [[Serbia]]. The regime targeted [[Jews]], [[Serbs]] and [[Romani people|Roma]] people, as part of a large-scale genocide campaigns were conducted in places such as the [[Jasenovac concentration camp]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Holocaust/Jasenovac.html |title=Jasenovac |publisher=Jewishvirtuallibrary.org |accessdate=3 June 2011}}</ref><ref name="Pavlowitch-p34">[[#Pavlowitch|Pavlowitch, 2008]], [http://books.google.com/?id=R8d2409V9tEC&pg=PA34&lpg=PA34 p. 34]</ref>

The state was officially a monarchy and [[Kingdom of Italy (1861<U+2013>1946)|Italian]] [[protectorate]] from the signing of the Treaties of Rome on 18 May 1941 until the [[Italian capitulation (WW2)|Italian capitulation]] on 8 September 1943, appointed by [[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy]], Prince [[Aimone of Savoy-Aosta]], initially refused to assume the crown in opposition to the Italian annexation of the [[Croats|Croat]]-majority populated region of [[Dalmatia]], however he later accepted the throne upon being pressured to do so by Victor Emmanuel III, and was titled Tomislav II of Croatia; however he never moved from Italy to reside in Croatia.<ref name="Rodogno" />

The state was actually controlled by the governing fascist [[Usta<U+0161>e]] movement and its ''Poglavnik'',<ref group=note>"''Poglavnik''" was a term coined by the [[Usta<U+0161>e]], and it was originally used as the title for the leader of the movement. In 1941 it was institutionalized in the NDH as the title of first the Prime Minister (1941<U+2013>43), and then the head of state (1943<U+2013>45). It was at all times held by [[Ante Paveli<U+0107>]] and became synonymous with him. The translation of the term varies. The root of the word is the [[Croatian language|Croatian]] word "''glava''", meaning "head" ("''Po''-''glav(a)''-''nik''"). The more literal translation is "head-man", while "leader" captures more of the meaning of the term (in relation to the German "''F<U+00FC>hrer''" and Italian "''Duce''").</ref> [[Ante Paveli<U+0107>]], which in turn were primarily under German influence. For its first two years up to 1943, the state was also a territorial [[Condominium (international law)|condominium]] of Germany and Italy.<ref>[[#Tomasevich-OaC|Tomasevich, 2001]], p. 60. "Thus on 15 April 1941, Paveli<U+0107> came to power, albeit a very limited power, in the new Ustasha state under the umbrella of German and Italian forces. On the same say German ''[[F<U+00FC>hrer]]'' [[Adolf Hitler]] and Italian ''[[Duce]]'' [[Benito Mussolini]] granted recognition to the Croatian state and declared that their governments would be glad to participate with the Croatian government in determining its frontiers."</ref><ref>Stephen R.

==Geography==
Geographically, the NDH encompassed most of modern-day [[Croatia]], all of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], and part of modern-day [[Serbia]]. It bordered the [[Third Reich]] to the north-west, [[Kingdom of Hungary (Regency)|Kingdom of Hungary]] to the north-east, [[Serbia (1941-1944)|Serbian administration]] (a joint German-Serb government) to the east, [[Montenegro (Second World War)|Montenegro]] (an Italian protectorate) to the south-east and [[Kingdom of Italy (1861<U+2013>1946)|Italy]] along its coastal area.

===Establishment of borders===
The exact borders of the Independent State of Croatia were unclear when it was established.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://public.mzos.hr/fgs.axd?id=10921 |title=Rise and fall of the NDH |accessdate=3 June 2011}}</ref> Approximately one month after its formation, significant areas of Croat-populated territory were ceded to its [[Axis powers|Axis]] allies, the Kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Hungary (Regency)|Hungary]] and [[Kingdom of Italy (1861<U+2013>1946)|Italy]].
*On 13 May 1941, the NDH government signed an agreement with [[Nazi Germany]] which demarcated their borders.<ref name="Prebeg">[http://povijest.net/index.php/Nezavisna-Drzava-Hrvatska/Gospodarstvo-Nezavisne-Drzave-Hrvatske-1941-1945.-1.html Business of the Independent State of Croatia]{{dead link|date=June 2011}}</ref>
*On 19 May the ''Rome contracts'' were signed by diplomats of the NDH and Italy. Large parts of Croatian lands were occupied (annexed) by Italy, including most of [[Dalmatia]] (including [[Split (city)|Split]] and [[<U+0160>ibenik]]), nearly all the Adriatic islands (including [[Rab]], [[Krk]], [[Vis (island)|Vis]], [[Kor<U+010D>ula]], [[Mljet]]), and some smaller areas such as the [[Boka Kotorska|Boka Kotorska bay]], parts of the [[Croatian Littoral]] and [[Gorski kotar]] areas.
*On 7 June the NDH government issued a decree that demarcated its eastern border with Serbia.<ref name="Prebeg"/>
*On 27 October the NDH and Italy reached an agreement on the Independent State of Croatia's border with [[Montenegro (World War II)|Montenegro]].
*On 8 September 1943, Italy capitulated and the NDH officially considered the Rome contracts to be void, along with the [[Treaty of Rapallo, 1920|Treaty of Rapallo]] of 1920 which had given Italy [[Istria]], Fiume (now [[Rijeka]]) and Zara ([[Zadar]]).<ref name="Kisic">Kisi<U+0107>-Kolanovi<U+0107>, Nada. ''Mladen Lorkovi<U+0107>-ministar urotnik'', Golden Marketing, Zagreb 1997. (pg. 304<U+2013>306)</ref> German foreign minister [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]] approved of the NDH taking the Dalmatian territories gained by Italy at the time of the Rome contracts.<ref name="Kisic"/> By now, most such territory was actually controlled by the [[Yugoslav Partisans]], since the cession of those areas had made them strongly anti-NDH (more than one third of the total population of Split is documented to have joined the Partisans).<ref>[http://www.ratnakronikasplita.com/impresum/uvod Ratna kronika Splita 1941<U+2013>1945] {{hr icon}}</ref> By 11 September 1943, NDH foreign minister Mladen Lorkovi<U+0107> received word from German consul [[Siegfried Kasche]] that the NDH should wait before moving on Istria. Germany's central government had already annexed Istria and Fiume ([[Rijeka]]) into the [[Operational Zone Adriatic Coast]] a day earlier.<ref name="Kisic"/> Zara was occupied solely by the Germans, and was probably considered a part of the puppet [[Italian Social Republic]].

[[Me<U+0111>imurje]] and southern [[Baranja region|Baranja]] were [[Hungarian occupation of Yugoslav territories|annexed (occupied) by the Kingdom of Hungary]]. NDH disputed this and continued to lay claim to both, naming the administrative province centred in Osijek as ''Great Parish Baranja'', despite none of the region lying within its control. This border was never legislated, although Hungary may have considered the [[Pacta conventa (Croatia)|Pacta conventa]] to be in effect, which delineated the two nation's borders along the [[Drava]] river.{{citation needed|reason=No such thing is mentioned in the Pacta Conventa article. Could it be an attempt to restore the pre-1918 border instead?|date=July 2012}}

When compared to the republican borders established in the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|SFR Yugoslavia]] after the war, the NDH encompassed the whole of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], with its majority of non-Croat ([[Serbs|Serbian]] and [[Bosniaks|Bosniak]]) populations, as well as some 20&nbsp;km<U+00B2> of [[Slovenia]] (villages [[Slovenska vas, Bre<U+017E>ice|Slovenska vas near Bregana]], [[Nova vas pri Mokricah|Nova vas near Mokrice]], [[Jesenice, Bre<U+017E>ice|Jesenice in Dolenjsko]], [[Obre<U+017E>je]] and [[<U+010C>edem]])<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.dnevnik.si/tiskane_izdaje/dnevnik/121558 |title=Mejo so zavarovali z <U+017E>ico in postavili mine |language=Slovene |trans_title=They Protected the Border with Wire and Set up Mines |newspaper=Dnevnik.si |first=Ernest |last=Se<U+010D>en |date=16 April 2005}}</ref> and the whole of [[Syrmia]] (part of which was previously in the [[Danube Banovina]]).

===Administrative divisions===
{{See also|Counties of the Independent State of Croatia|Districts of the Independent State of Croatia}}
The Independent State of Croatia had three levels of administrative divisions: great parishes (Velika Zhupa), districts and municipalities. At the time of its foundation, the state had 22 great parishes, 142 kotars and 1006 municipalities.<ref>Pusi<U+0107>, Eugen.

==History==

===Influences on the rise of the Usta<U+0161>e===
{{See also|Creation of Yugoslavia}}

In 1915 a group of political emigres from Austria-Hungary, predominantly Croats but including some Serbs and a Slovene, formed themselves into a [[Yugoslav Committee]], with a view to creating a South Slav state in the aftermath of World War I. They saw this as a way to prevent Dalmatia being ceded to Italy under the [[Treaty of London (1915)]]. In 1918, the [[National Council of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]] sent a delegation to the Serbian monarch to offer unification of the [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]] with the Kingdom of Serbia. The leader of the [[Croatian Peasant Party]], [[Stjepan Radi<U+0107>]], warned on their departure for Belgrade that the council had no democratic legitimacy. But a new state, the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]], was duly proclaimed on 1 December 1918, with no heed taken of legal protocols such as the signing of a new ''[[Pacta conventa (Croatia)|Pacta conventa]]'' in recognition of historic Croatian state rights.<ref>Ferdo <U+0160>i<U+0161>i<U+0107>: ''Ljetopis Jugoslavenske akademije'', Vol.49 (Zagreb 1936) p279</ref><ref>Srdja Trifkovic: ''Usta<U+0161>a'', Lord Byron Foundation for Balkan Studies (London 1998) pp20 ff</ref>

Croats were at the outset politically disadvantaged with the centralized political structure of the kingdom, which was seen as favouring the Serb majority. The political situation of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes was fractious and violent. In 1927, the [[Independent Democratic Party]], which represented the [[Serbs of Croatia]], turned its back on the centralist policy of King Alexander. On 20 June 1928, Stjepan Radi<U+0107> and four other Croat deputies were shot while in the Belgrade parliament by a member of the [[People's Radical Party|Serbian People's Radical Party]]. Three of the deputies, including Radi<U+0107>, died. The outrage that resulted from the [[assassination of Stjepan Radi<U+0107>]] threatened to destabilise the kingdom. In January 1929, [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia|King Alexander]] responded by proclaiming a royal dictatorship, under which all dissenting political activity was banned and renaming the state the "Kingdom of Yugoslavia".

One consequence of Alexander's 1929 proclamation and the repression and persecution of Croatian nationalists was a rise of support for the Croatian extreme nationalist, [[Ante Paveli<U+0107>]], who had been a Zagreb deputy in the Yugoslav parliament and who was to be implicated in Alexander's assassination in 1934, went into exile in Italy and gained support for his vision of liberating Croatia from Serb control and racially "purifying" Croatia. While residing in Italy, Paveli<U+0107> and other Croatian exiles founded the [[Usta<U+0161>a]] insurgency.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.moljac.hr/biografije/pavelic.htm |title=Ante Paveli<U+0107> on Croatian |publisher=Moljac.hr |accessdate=3 June 2011}}</ref>

===Establishment of NDH===
Following the attack of the [[Axis powers of World War II|Axis powers]] on the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] in 1941, and the quick defeat of the Yugoslav Army (''Jugoslavenska Vojska''), the country was occupied by Axis forces.

The Axis powers had offered Vladko Ma<U+010D>ek the opportunity to form a government, since Ma<U+010D>ek and his party, the [[Croatian Peasant Party]] ({{lang-hr|links=no|Hrvatska selja<U+010D>ka stranka <U+2013> HSS}}) had the greatest electoral support among Yugoslavia's Croats - but Ma<U+010D>ek refused that offer.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://globus.jutarnji.hr/zivot/knjiga-koje-se-boje-i-crveni-i-crni | language = Croatian | newspaper = [[Globus (weekly)|Globus]] | title = Knjiga koje se boje i crveni i crni | quote = Dr. Jozo Tomasevich [...] <U+201C>Rat i revolucija u Jugoslaviji 1941.-1945.<U+201D> [...] Vladko Ma<U+010D>ek, prvak HSS-a, koji je u travnju 1941. zastupao ve<U+0107>inu Hrvata, nije bio voljan prihvatiti <U+201C>nezavisnost<U+201D> koja se tada nudila po cijeni koju je Hitler nametnuo. | accessdate = 2013-02-04}}</ref>

[[Slavko Kvaternik]], deputy leader of the [[Usta<U+0161>e]] proclaimed the establishment of the Independent State of Croatia (NDH <U+2013> Nezavisna Dr<U+017E>ava Hrvatska) on 10 April 1941. Paveli<U+0107>, who was known by his Usta<U+0161>e title, "''Poglavnik''" returned to [[Zagreb]] from exile in Italy on 17 April and became the absolute leader of the NDH throughout its existence.

Acceding to the demands of [[Benito Mussolini]] [[National Fascist Party|Fascist]] regime in the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861<U+2013>1946)|Kingdom of Italy]], Paveli<U+0107> reluctantly accepted [[Tomislav II of Croatia, 4th Duke of Aosta|Aimone the 4th Duke of Aosta]] as a [[figurehead]] King of the NDH under his new royal name, Tomislav II. Tomislav II never visited the NDH and had no influence over the government, which was dominated by Paveli<U+0107>. Tomislav II was not interested in being the figurehead King of Croatia.<ref name="autogenerated5" /> On learning that he had been named King of Croatia, he told close colleagues that he thought his nomination was a bad joke by his cousin King [[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy|Victor Emmanuel III]] though he accepted the crown out of a sense of duty.<ref name="Petacco">{{cite book| last =Petacco| first =Arrigo| title =A Tragedy Revealed: The Story of the Italian Population of Istria, Dalmatia, and Venezia Giulia| publisher =University of Toronto Press| year =2005| pages =26, 27| isbn =0-8020-3921-9 }}</ref> Tomislav II's position was intended by the Italian Fascist regime to legitimize the presence of Italian armed forces on Croatian soil.

From a strategic perspective, establishment of the NDH was a means by Mussolini and Hitler to pacify the Croats, while reducing the use of Axis resources, which were more urgently needed for [[Operation Barbarossa]]. Meanwhile, Mussolini used his long-established support for Croatian independence as leverage to coerce Paveli<U+0107> into signing an agreement on 19 May 1941, under which central [[Dalmatia]] and parts of [[Hrvatsko primorje]] and [[Gorski kotar]] were ceded to Italy.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,765632,00.html |title=Foreign News: Crown of Zvonimir |work=TIME |date=26 May 1941 |accessdate=3 June 2011}}</ref> Under the same agreement, the NDH was restricted to a minimal [[Navy of the Independent State of Croatia|navy]] and Italian forces were granted military control of the entire Croatian coastline. After Paveli<U+0107> signed the agreement, other Croatian politicians rebuked him. Paveli<U+0107> publicly defended the decision and thanked Germany and Italy for supporting Croatian independence.<ref name="Tanner-p147">[[#Tanner|Tanner, 1997]], p. 147</ref> This concession to Italy sowed the seeds of discontent between the "home" and "emigre" elements of the Usta<U+0161>a that continued through the lifetime of the NDH.

After refusing leadership of the NDH, Ma<U+010D>ek called on all to obey and cooperate with the new government. The Roman Catholic Church was also openly supportive of the government. According to Ma<U+010D>ek, the new state was greeted with a "wave of enthusiasm" in Zagreb, often by people "blinded and intoxicated" by the fact that the Germans had "gift-wrapped their occupation under the euphemistic title of ''Independent State of Croatia''". But in the villages, Ma<U+010D>ek wrote, the peasantry believed that "their struggle over the past 30 years to become masters of their homes and their country had suffered a tremendous setback".<ref>Ma<U+010D>ek pp.&nbsp;220<U+2013>231</ref>

Dissatisfied with the Paveli<U+0107> regime in its early months, the Axis Powers in September 1941 asked Ma<U+010D>ek to take over, but Ma<U+010D>ek again refused. Perceiving Ma<U+010D>ek as a potential rival, Paveli<U+0107> subsequently had him arrested and imprisoned in the Jasenovac concentration camp. The Usta<U+0161>e initially did not have an army or administration capable of controlling all the territory of the NDH. The Usta<U+0161>e movement had fewer than 12,000 members when the war started. While the Usta<U+0161>e's own estimates put the number of their sympathizers even in the early phase at around 40,000.<ref>[[#Pavlowitch|Pavlowitch, 2008]] {{page needed|date=July 2012}}</ref>

{{History of Croatia}}
Previously important organizations, the [[Croatian Peasant Party]] (HSS) and the Catholic Church, were relatively uninvolved in the creation and maintenance of the Independent State of Croatia. Many organizations that opposed or threatened the Usta<U+0161>e were eventually outlawed.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} For example, the Croatian Peasant Party was banned on 11 June 1941 in an attempt by the Usta<U+0161>e to displace the party as the primary representative of the Croatian peasantry{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} and its leader, [[Vladko Ma<U+010D>ek]], was sent to the Jasenovac concentration camp. The Catholic Church initially participated in state mandated religious conversions, but eventually the main branches of the Church stopped when it became obvious that these conversions were merely a form of punishment for the ''undesirable'' population.

===Italian influence===
{{refimprove section|date=December 2012}}
Italian Fascist dictator Benito Mussolini and Ante Paveli<U+0107> had close relations prior to the war. Mussolini and Paveli<U+0107> both despised the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Italy had been promised, in the [[London Pact]] of 1915, that it would receive Dalmatia from Austria-Hungary at the end of World War I. The peace negotiations in 1919, however, influenced by the [[Fourteen Points]] proclaimed by Woodrow Wilson, called for national self-determination and determined that the Yugoslavs rightfully deserved the territory in question. Italian nationalists were enraged. Italian nationalist [[Gabriele D'Annunzio]] raided the Croatian town of [[Fiume]] (which held a mixed population of Croats and Italians) and proclaimed it part of the [[Italian Regency of Carnaro]]. D'Annunzio declared himself "[[Duce]]" of Carnaro and his blackshirted revolutionaries held control over the town. D'Annunzio was known for engaging in passionate speeches aimed to draw Croatian nationalists to support his actions and to oppose Yugoslavia.<ref>Bosworth, Richard J. B. 2005. ''Mussolini's Italy''. New Work: Allen Lane. pp112-113</ref> Croatian nationalists, such as Paveli<U+0107>, opposed the border changes that occurred after World War I. Not only was D'Annunzio's symbolism copied by Mussolini but also D'Annunzio's appeal to Croatian support for the dismantling of Yugoslavia was copied and implemented as a foreign policy approach to Yugoslavia by Mussolini.

Paveli<U+0107> had been in negotiations with Italy since 1927 that included advocating a territory-for-sovereignty swap in which he would tolerate Italy annexing its claimed territory in Dalmatia in exchange for Italy supporting the sovereignty of an independent Croatia.<ref>Bernd J<U+00FC>rgen Fischer (ed.). ''Balkan strongmen: dictators and authoritarian rulers of South Eastern Europe''. Purdue University Press, 2007. Pp. 210.</ref> In the 1930s, upon Paveli<U+0107> and the Usta<U+0161>e being forced into exile by the Yugoslav government, Mussolini offered Paveli<U+0107> and the Usta<U+0161>e sanctuary in Italy and allowed them to use training grounds to prepare for war against Yugoslavia. In exchange for this support, Mussolini demanded that Paveli<U+0107> agree that [[Dalmatia]] would become part of Italy if Italy and the Usta<U+0161>e successfully waged war on Yugoslavia. Although Dalmatia was a largely Croat-populated territory, it had been part of various Italian states, such as the [[Roman Empire]] and the [[Republic of Venice]], for centuries and was part of [[Italian nationalism]]'s irredentist claims. In exchange for this concession, Mussolini offered Paveli<U+0107> the right for Croatia to annex all of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], which had only a minority Croat population. Paveli<U+0107> agreed to this controversial exchange.

After the invasion and occupation of Yugoslavia, Italy annexed numerous Adriatic islands and a portion of [[Dalmatia]] that was formed into the Italian [[Governorship of Dalmatia]] including territory from the provinces of [[Split (city)|Split]], [[Zadar]], and [[Kotor]].<ref name="Davide Rodogno 2006. Pp. 80-81">Davide Rodogno. Fascism's European empire: Italian occupation during the Second World War. Cambridge, England, UK: Cambridge University Press, 2006. Pp. 80<U+2013>81.</ref> Though Italy had initially larger territorial aims that extended from the [[Velebit|Velebit mountains]] to the [[Albanian Alps]], Mussolini decided against annexing further territories due to a number of factors, including that Italy held the economically valuable portion of that territory within its possession while the northern Adriatic coast had no important railways or roads and because a larger annexation would have included hundreds of thousands of Slavs who were hostile to Italy, within its national borders.<ref name="Davide Rodogno 2006. Pp. 80-81"/>

Italy intended to keep the NDH within its sphere of influence by forbidding it to build any significant navy.<ref name="Tanner-p147"/> Italy only permitted small patrol boats to be used by NDH forces. This policy forbidding the creation of NDH warships was part of the Italian Fascists' policy of ''[[Italian Mare Nostrum|Mare Nostrum]]'' (Latin for "Our Sea") in which Italy was to dominate the Mediterranean as the [[Roman Empire]] had done centuries earlier.

Italian armed forces assisted the Usta<U+0161>e government in persecuting Serbs. In 1941, Italian forces captured and interned the Serbian Orthodox [[Bishop Irinej]] of [[Dalmatia]].<ref name="Tanner-p151">Tanner, Pp. 151</ref>

===German influence===
[[File:Adolf Hitler meets Ante Paveli<U+0107>.1941.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Germany's ''[[F<U+00FC>hrer]]'' [[Adolf Hitler]] (left) with ''Poglavnik'' Ante Paveli<U+0107> (right) at the [[Berghof (residence)|Berghof]] outside of [[Berchtesgaden]], Germany.]]
At the time of the invasion of Yugoslavia by Germany, [[Adolf Hitler]] was uneasy with Mussolini's agenda of creating a puppet Croatian state, and preferred that areas outside of Italian territorial aims become part of Hungary as an autonomous territory.<ref name="autogenerated1">[http://www.snd-us.com/Liberty/st_jasenovac_revisited.htm Dr. Srdja Trifkovic Comments on Holocaust Museum Jasenovac Exhibit <U+2013> 25 November 2001]{{dead link|date=June 2011}}</ref> This would appease Germany's ally Hungary and its nationalist territorial claims and would also avoid the creation of a Slavic puppet state, as Hitler viewed all Slavs as racially degenerate {{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}.

The German position on Croatia changed after the invasion of Yugoslavia in 1941. The invasion was spearheaded by a strong German invasion force which was largely responsible for the capture of Yugoslavia. Military forces from other Axis powers, including Italy, Hungary, and Bulgaria made few gains during the invasion. The invasion was precipitated by the need for German forces to reach Greece to save Italian forces, which were failing on the battlefield against the Greek armed forces. Upon rescuing Italian forces in Greece and having conquered Yugoslavia and Greece almost single handedly, Hitler became frustrated with Mussolini and Italy's military incompetence. Germany improved relations with the Usta<U+0161>e and supported the NDH claims to annex the Adriatic Coast in order reduce Italy's planned territorial gains.<ref name="autogenerated1" /> Nevertheless, Italy annexed a significant central portion of Dalmatia and various Adriatic Islands. This was not what had been agreed with Paveli<U+0107> prior to the invasion; Italy had expected to annex all of Dalmatia as part of its irredentist claims.

Hitler sparred with his army commanders over what policy should be undertaken in Croatia regarding the Serbs. German military officials thought that Serbs could be rallied to fight against the [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisans]]. Hitler disagreed with his commanders, but pointed out to Paveli<U+0107> that the NDH could create a completely Croat state only if it followed a constant policy of persecution of the non-Croat population for at least fifty years.<ref name="Tanner-p147"/>

As early as 10 July 1941, Wehrmacht General [[Edmund Glaise-Horstenau|Edmund Glaise von Horstenau]] reported the following to the German High Command, the [[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht]] (OKW):{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}
{{quote|''Our troops have to be mute witnesses of such events; it does not reflect well on their otherwise high reputation... I am frequently told that German occupation troops would finally have to intervene against Usta<U+0161>e crimes. This may happen eventually. Right now, with the available forces, I could not ask for such action. Ad hoc intervention in individual cases could make the German Army look responsible for countless crimes which it could not prevent in the past.''|<small>General [[Edmund Glaise von Horstenau]], German military attach<U+00E9> in Zagreb</small>}}

The [[Gestapo]] report to Reichsf<U+00FC>hrer SS [[Heinrich Himmler]], dated 17 February 1942, states that:{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}
{{quote|''Increased activity of the bands is chiefly due to atrocities carried out by Usta<U+0161>e units in Croatia against the Orthodox population. The Usta<U+0161>e committed their deeds in a bestial manner not only against males of conscript age, but especially against helpless old people, women and children. The number of the Orthodox that the Croats have [[massacre]]d and sadistically tortured to death is about three hundred thousand.''|<small>[[Gestapo]] report to Reichsf<U+00FC>hrer SS [[Heinrich Himmler]], February 17, 1942</small>}}

According to reports by General Glaise-Horstenau, Hitler was angry with Paveli<U+0107>, whose policy inflamed the rebellion in Croatia, thwarting any prospect of deploying NDH forces on the Eastern Front.<ref name="zvonko">Hebrang, by Zvonko Ivankovi<U+0107> <U+2013> Vonta, Scientia Yugoslavica 1988 Pages 169<U+2013>170</ref> Moreover, Hitler was forced to engage large forces of his own to keep the rebellion in check. For that reason, Hitler summoned Paveli<U+0107> to his war headquarters in [[Vinnytsia]] (Ukraine) on 23 September 1942. Consequently, Paveli<U+0107> replaced his minister of the Armed Forces, Slavko Kvaternik, with the less zealous Jure Franceti<U+0107>. Kvaternik was sent into exile in Slovakia <U+2013> along with his son [[Eugen Dido Kvaternik|Eugen]], who was blamed for the persecution of the Serbs in Croatia.<ref>[[#Tomasevich-OaC|Tomasevich, 2001]], p. 440</ref> Before meeting Hitler, to appease the public, Paveli<U+0107> published an "Important Government Announcement" (<U+00BB>Va<U+017E>na obavijest Vlade<U+00AB>), in which he threatened those who were spreading the news "about non-existent threats of disarmament of the Ustashe units by representatives of one foreign power, about the Croatian Army replacement by a foreign army, about the possibility that a foreign power would seize the power in Croatia ..."<ref>Hrvatski narod, 3 September 1942</ref>

<!--See talk. Hans Helm, the appointed head of the [[Gestapo]] in the Independent State of Croatia, wrote in his confidential 14 January 1943 report (titled as "Basis of the partisan danger" and sent to General Kasche):

{{cquote|The new regime in Croatia started programs of annihilation and destruction of the Serbs, which ''[the programs]'' are publicly supported by the highest ranks of the Croatian government, and adopted as the main government goal. The fact that different talk is coming from the official Usta<U+0161>e side <U+2013> under pressure by the rebellion and due to the course of events, even a reconciliation was mentioned <U+2013> leaves no possibility to compensate the harm caused by, for example, Dr. [[Mile Budak]], the actual ''[Croatian]'' minister in Berlin....<ref name="zvonko"/>}}-->
General Glaise-Horstenau reported: "The Usta<U+0161>e movement is, due to the mistakes and atrocities they have committed and the corruption, so compromised that the government executive branch (the home guard and the police) shall be separated from the government <U+2013> even for the price of breaking any possible connection with the government."

Reichsf<U+00FC>hrer-SS [[Heinrich Himmler]] is quoted characterizing the Independent State of Croatia as "ridiculous": "our beloved German settlements will be secured. I hope that the area south of Srem will be liberated by [...] the [[13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar (1st Croatian)|Bosnian division]] [...] so that we can at least restore partial order in this ridiculous (Croatian) state."<ref>"Himmler's Bosnian Division" by Georg Lepre, p17.</ref>

The Usta<U+0161>e gained German support for plans to eliminate the Serb population in Croatia. One plan involved an exchange in 1941 between Germany and the NDH, in which 20,000 Catholic Slovenes would be deported from German-held Slovenia and sent to the NDH where they would be assimilated as Croats. In exchange, 20,000 Serbs would be deported from the NDH and sent to the [[Serbia (1941-1944)|rump Serbian State]].<ref name="Tanner-p151" /> The German occupation forces allowed the expulsion of Serbs to Serbia, but instead of sending the Slovenes to Croatia, they were also deported to Serbia.<ref name="Tanner-p151" /> In total, about 300,000 Serbs had been deported or fled from the NDH to Serbia by the end of World War II.<ref name="Tanner-p151" />

The atrocities committed by the Usta<U+0161>e stunned observers, Brigadier [[Sir Fitzroy MacLean, 1st Baronet|Sir Fitzroy MacLean]], Chief of the British military mission to the Partisans commented, "Some Usta<U+0161>e collected the eyes of Serbs they had killed, sending them, when they had enough, to the Poglavnik ''['head-man']'' for his inspection or proudly displaying them and other human organs in the caf<U+00E9>s of Zagreb."<ref>[[Christopher Pyle|Pyle, Christopher H.]]; ''Extradition, politics, and human rights''; [[Temple University Press]], 2001 ISBN 1-56639-823-1; pp. 132.

The Nazi regime demanded that the Usta<U+0161>e adopt anti-Semitic racial policies, persecute Jews and set up [[Concentration camps in the Independent State of Croatia|several concentration camps]]. Pavelic and the Usta<U+0161>e accepted Nazi demands, but their racial policy focused primarily on eliminating the Serb population. When the Usta<U+0161>e needed more recruits to help exterminate the Serbs, and the state broke away from Nazi anti-Semitic policy by promising honorary Aryan citizenship, and thus freedom from persecution, to Jews who were willing to fight for the NDH.<ref name="Tanner-149">[[#Tanner|Tanner, 1997]], Pp. 149</ref> As this was the only legal means allowing Jews to escape persecution, a number of Jews joined the NDH's armed forces. This aggravated the German SS, which claimed that the NDH let 5,000 Jews survive via service in the NDH's armed forces.<ref name="Tanner-149" /> German anti-Semitic objectives for Croatia were further undermined by Italy's reluctance to adhere to a strict anti-Semitic policy, which resulted in Jews in Italian-held parts of Croatia avoiding the same persecution facing Jews in German-held eastern Croatia.<ref>[[#Tanner|Tanner, 1997]], pp. 149<U+2013>150</ref>

After Italy abandoned the war in 1943, German forces occupied western Croatia and the NDH annexed the territory ceded to Italy in 1941.

=== Partisans and the Yugoslav front ===
{{Main|Yugoslav Front}}

The Usta<U+0161>e's genocidal onslaught on its minorities provoked mass movements of resistance, inspired in part by royalist ([[<U+010C>etnik]]) and <U+2013> more effectively <U+2013> communist ([[Yugoslav Partisan|Partisan]]) ideologies, but driven primarily by a determination to fight back by any means. The uprisings were particularly strong in rural areas where many village populations fled from the terror and then mounted guerilla operations from vantage points in the mountains and forests. On 22 June 1941, the [[First Sisak Partisan Brigade]] was formed in the [[Brezovica forest]] near [[Sisak]], Croatia; this was to be celebrated as the first armed resistance unit formed in occupied Europe during World War II. Croats, Serbs, Bosniaks, and citizens of all nationalities and backgrounds began joining the pan-Yugoslav [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisans]] led by [[Josip Broz Tito]]. The Partisan movement was soon able to control a large percentage of the NDH (and Yugoslavia) and before long the cities of occupied [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]] and [[Dalmatia]] in particular were surrounded by these Partisan-controlled areas, with their garrisons living in a ''de facto'' state of siege and constantly trying to maintain control of the rail-links.<ref>[http://www.vojska.net/eng/world-war-2/battles-and-operations ]{{dead link|date=June 2011}}</ref>

Croats were significantly more numerous than Serbs among the Partisan ranks.<ref>[http://www.vojska.net/eng/world-war-2/yugoslavia/brigade ]{{dead link|date=June 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vojska.net/eng/world-war-2/yugoslavia/detachment/partisan/ |title=Partisans detachments of Yugoslavia 1941<U+2013>45 |publisher=Vojska.net |accessdate=3 June 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vojska.net/eng/world-war-2/yugoslavia/statistics/partisans/ |title=Strength of People's Liberation Army and Partisan Detachments |publisher=Vojska.net |accessdate=3 June 2011}}</ref> In 1944, the third year of the war in Yugoslavia, Croats formed 60% of the Partisan operational units originating from the [[Federal State of Croatia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vojska.net/eng/world-war-2/yugoslavia/statistics/partisans/ |title=Strength of Yugoslav partisans |publisher=Vojska.net |accessdate=3 June 2011}}</ref> The Partisan movement was generally multiethnic, although at least one Croatian unit was overwhelmingly Serbian (the 6th Lika Proletariat Division "Nikola Tesla").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vojska.net/hrv/drugi-svjetski-rat/jugoslavija/divizija/6/ |title=Sixth Lika Proletariat Division Nikola Tesla |publisher=Vojska.net |date=11 December 2006 |accessdate=3 June 2011}}</ref> FS Croatia also had the highest number of detachments and brigades among the federal units, and together with the forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Partisan resistance in the NDH made up the majority of the movement's military strength. The Partisan commander, Marshall Josip Broz Tito, was half Slovene, half Croatian.

=== Relations with the Chetniks ===
{{See also|Chetniks}}
[[File:Chetniks, Ustasa, and Domobrani.jpg|thumb|Representatives of the [[Chetniks]], [[Usta<U+0161>e]], and [[Army of the Independent State of Croatia|Croatian Home Guard]] meet in occupied Bosnia]]
After the 1941 split between the [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisans]] and the [[Chetniks]] in Serbia, the Chetnik groups in central, eastern, and northwestern [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]] found themselves caught between the German and [[Usta<U+0161>e]] (NDH) forces on one side and the Partisans on the other. In early 1942 Chetnik Major [[Jezdimir Dangi<U+0107>]] approached the Germans in an attempt to arrive at an understanding, but was unsuccessful, and the local Chetnik leaders were forced to look for another solution. The Chetnik groups were in fundamental disagreement with the Usta<U+0161>e on practically all issues, but they found a common enemy in the Partisans, and this was the overriding reason for the collaboration which ensued between the [[Usta<U+0161>e]] authorities of the Independent State of Croatia and Chetnik detachments in Bosnia. The first formal agreement between Bosnian Chetniks and the [[Usta<U+0161>e]] was concluded on 28 May 1942, in which Chetnik leaders expresseed their loyalty as "citizens of the Independent State of Croatia" both to the state and its Poglavnik ([[Ante Paveli<U+0107>]]). During the next three weeks, three additional agreements were signed, covering a large part of the area of Bosnia (along with the Chetnik detachments within it). By the provision of these agreements, the Chetniks were to cease hostilities against the Usta<U+0161>e state, and the Usta<U+0161>e would establish regular administration in these areas.<ref name="Tomasevich-p226">[[#Tomasevich-Che|Tomasevich, 1975]] [http://books.google.com/books?id=yoCaAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA226 p. 226]</ref><ref name="Cohen-Riesman-p40">[[#Cohen-Riesman|Cohen, Riesman, 1996]], [http://books.google.com/books?id=Fz1PW_wnHYMC&pg=PA40&dq=chetniks+collaboration#v=onepage&q=chetniks%20collaboration&f=false p. 40]</ref> The main provision, Art. 5 of the agreement, states as follows:

<blockquote>As long as there is danger from the Partisan armed bands, the Chetnik formations will cooperate voluntarily with the Croatian military in fighting and destroying the Partisans and in those operations they will be under the overall command of the Croatian armed forces. [...] Chetnik formations may engage in operations against the Partisans on their own, but this they will have to report, on time, to the Croatian military commanders.<ref name="Tomasevich-p226" /></blockquote>

The necessary ammunition and provisions were supplied to the Chetniks by the Usta<U+0161>e military. Chetniks who were wounded in such operations would be cared for in NDH hospitals, while the orphans and widows of  Chetniks killed in action would be supported by the Usta<U+0161>e state. Persons specifically recommended by Chetnik commanders would be returned home from the Usta<U+0161>e concentration camps (Jasenovac concentration camp). These agreements covered the majority of Chetnik forces in Bosnia east of the German-Italian demarcation line, and lasted throughout most of the war. Since Croatian forces were immediately subordinate to the German military occupation, collaboration with Croatian forces was, in fact, indirect collaboration with the Germans.<ref name="Tomasevich-p226" /><ref name="Cohen-Riesman-p40" />

===End of the war===
In August 1944, there was an attempt by the NDH Foreign [[Political minister|Minister]] [[Mladen Lorkovi<U+0107>]] and Minister of War [[Ante Voki<U+0107>]] to execute a coup d'<U+00E9>tat against Ante Paveli<U+0107>. The [[Lorkovi<U+0107>-Voki<U+0107> coup]] failed and its conspirators were executed.

By early 1945, the NDH army withdrew towards Zagreb with German and [[Cossacks|Cossack]] troops. They were overpowered and the advance of Tito's Partisan forces, joined by the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Red Army]], caused a mass retreat of the Usta<U+0161>e towards Austria and effectively an end to the Independent State of Croatia. In May 1945, a large column composed of NDH Home Guard troops, Usta<U+0161>a, Cossacks, some Chetniks and the Slovene Home Guard, as well as numerous civilians, retreated from the Partisan forces heading northwest towards Italy and Austria. The [[German Instrument of Surrender]] was signed on 8 May, but the Germans put Paveli<U+0107> in sole command of NDH forces, and he ordered to continue fighting as the columns tried to reach the British forces to negotiate passage into [[Allied-occupied Austria]]. The British Army, however, refused them entry and turned them over to the Partisan forces, starting the [[Bleiburg repatriations]].

Meanwhile, Ante Paveli<U+0107> had detached from the group and fled to Austria, Italy, [[Argentina]] and finally Spain, where he would die in 1959. Several other members of the NDH government were captured in May and June 1945, and sentenced to death or long-term inprisonment in the [[Trial of Mile Budak]].

The end of the war resulted in the establishment of the Democratic Republic of Yugoslavia (which later became the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]), with the [[1946 Yugoslav Constitution|Constitution of 1946]] officially making the [[People's Republic of Croatia]] and the [[People's Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] two of the six constituent republics of the new state.

===Aftermath===
Although [[far right in Croatia|far right movements in Croatia]] inspired by the former NDH reemerged during the [[Croatian War of Independence]], the current [[Constitution of Croatia]] does not recognize the Independent State of Croatia as the historical or legitimate [[predecessor state]] of the current Croatian republic.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.sabor.hr/Default.aspx?art=2406&sec=729 | work = The Constitution of the Republic of Croatia (consolidated text) | title = Historical Foundations | quote = in the establishment of the foundations of state sovereignty during the course of the Second World War, as expressed in the decision of the Territorial Antifascist Council of the National Liberation of Croatia (1943) in opposition to proclamation of the Independent State of Croatia (1941), and then in the Constitution of the People<U+2019>s Republic of Croatia (1947) and in all subsequent constitutions of the Socialist Republic of Croatia (1963<U+2013>1990), at the historic turning-point characterized by the rejection of the communist system and changes in the international order in Europe, in the first democratic elections (1990), the Croatian nation reaffirmed, by its freely expressed will, its millennial statehood | publisher = [[Croatian Parliament]] | accessdate =16 February 2011}}</ref> Despite this, upon declaring independence from Yugoslavia, the Republic of Croatia rehabilitated the [[Army of the Independent State of Croatia|Croatian Home Guard]], who now receive a state pension.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hrcak.srce.hr/file/25853 |title=The Political Economy of Pension Reforms in Croatia 1991<U+2013>2006 |accessdate=3 June 2011}}</ref>

==Government==
The absolute leader of the NDH was [[Ante Paveli<U+0107>]], who was known by his Usta<U+0161>e title, ''[[Poglavnik]]'', throughout the war, regardless of his official government post. From 1941 to 1943, while the country was a ''[[de jure]]'' monarchy, Paveli<U+0107> was its powerful Prime Minister (or "President of the Government"). After the capitulation of Italy, Paveli<U+0107> became the [[head of state]] in the place of [[Aimone, Duke of Aosta]] ("Tomislav II") and retained the position of Prime Minister until early 1944, when he appointed [[Nikola Mandi<U+0107>]] to replace him.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vojska.net/eng/world-war-2/independent-state-of-croatia/government/5/ |title=Fifth government of NDH |publisher=Vojska.net |accessdate=3 June 2011}}</ref>

===Monarchy===
Upon the formation of the NDH, Paveli<U+0107> conceded to the accession of Aimone, the 4th Duke of Aosta, as a [[figurehead]] King of Croatia under his new royal name, Tomislav II. Tomislav II was not interested in being the figurehead King of Croatia,<ref name="autogenerated5">The Marshall Cavendish Illustrated Encyclopedia of World War II, New York <U+2013> London, 1980, Pages 394<U+2013>395</ref> never actually visited the country and had no influence over the government. In the summer of 1941, Tomislav II declared that he would accept his position as King, only if certain demands were met:
#that he should be informed about all Italian activities on NDH territory;
#that his reign should be confirmed by the NDH Croatian State Parliament; and
#that politics should play no part in the Croatian armed forces.<ref>Stevan K. Pavlowich:The King Who</ref>
The demands for German and Italian military departures were obviously impossible to be met by the Italian and German governments, and Tomislav II thus avoided taking up his position in Croatia. Aimone, initially refused to assume the crown in opposition to the Italian annexation of the Croat-majority populated region of Dalmatia, however he later accepted the throne upon being pressured to do so by Victor Emmanuel III; however he never moved from Italy to reside in Croatia.<ref name="Rodogno" />
{{Fascism sidebar}}
Following the dismissal of Italian leader [[Benito Mussolini]] on 25 July 1943, Tomislav II abdicated on 31 July on the orders of King [[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy]]. Shortly after the [[Armistice between Italy and Allied armed forces|armistice with Italy]] in September 1943, Ante Paveli<U+0107>  declared that Tomislav II was no longer King of Croatia.<ref>International documents of NDH</ref> Tomislav II formally renounced his title in October 1943 after the birth of his son [[Amedeo, 5th Duke of Aosta|Amedeo]], to whom he gave the name Zvonimir II.<ref name="one">{{cite web|author=Ben Cahoon |url=http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Croatia.html |title=Croatia |publisher=Worldstatesmen.org |accessdate=3 June 2011}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news| title =Royal House of Italy| newspaper =[[European royal houses]]|url =http://www.chivalricorders.org/royalty/gotha/italygen.htm| postscript =<!--None-->}}</ref>

Tomislav II's full title was "King of Croatia, Prince of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Voivode of Dalmatia, Tuzla and Knin, Duke of Aosta (from 1942), Prince of Cisterna and of Belriguardo, Marquess of Voghera, and Count of Ponderano."

===Parliament===

The NDH Parliament was established by the ''Legal Decree on the Croatian State Parliament'' on 24 January 1942.<ref name="Peric259">Peri<U+0107>, Ivo. ''Vladko Macek: Politicki portret''. Golden marketing-Tehnicka knjiga. Zagreb, 2003 (pg.259<U+2013>260)</ref>  The parliament members were not elected and meetings were convened just over a dozen times after the initial session in 1942. Its president vas [[Marko Dosen]].

This decree established five categories of individuals who would receive an invitation to be a member of parliament from the Usta<U+0161>e-appointed government: living Croatian representatives from the Croatian Parliament of 1918, living Croatian representatives elected in the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia parliamentary election, 1938|1938 Yugoslavian elections]], members of the [[Party of Rights (1861-1929)|Croatian Party of Rights]] prior to 1919, certain officials of the Supreme Usta<U+0161>e Headquarters and two members of the German national assembly.<ref name="Peric259" /> The responsibility for assembling all eligible members of parliament was given to the head of the Supreme Court, Nikola Vukeli<U+0107>, who found 204 people to be eligible.<ref name="Peric259" /> In accordance with the decree, Vukeli<U+0107> ruled that those who had received the position of senator in 1939, had been part of [[Du<U+0161>an Simovi<U+0107>]]'s government, or had been part of the Yugoslav government-in-exile forfeited their eligibility.<ref name="Peric259" /> Two hundred and four people were declared eligible for the parliament, with 141 actually attending parliamentary meetings. Of the 204 eligible parliament members, 93 were members of the [[Croatian Peasant Party]], 56 of whom attended meetings.<ref name="Peric259" />

The Parliament was only a deliberatory body and was not empowered to enact legislation. However, during the eighth session of the parliament in February 1942, the Usta<U+0161>e regime was put on the defensive when a joint Croatian Peasant Party-Croatian Party of Rights motion, supported by 39 members of parliament, questioned about the whereabouts of the Peasant Party's leader [[Vladko Ma<U+010D>ek]].<ref name="Peric259" /> The following session, Ante Paveli<U+0107> responded that Ma<U+010D>ek was being kept in isolation to prevent him from coming into contact with Yugoslav government officials. In less than a month, Ma<U+010D>ek was moved from the [[Jasenovac concentration camp]] and put on house arrest at his property in Kupinec.<ref name="Peric259" />  Ma<U+010D>ek was later called upon by foreigners to take a stand and counteract the Paveli<U+0107> government, but he refused. Ma<U+010D>ek fled the country in 1945, with the help of Usta<U+0161>e General Ante Mo<U+0161>kov.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vojska.net/eng/biography/m/moskov/ante/ |title=Ante Moskov (Mo<U+0161>kov)|publisher=Vojska.net |accessdate=3 June 2011}}</ref>

After its February 1942 session, the Parliament met only a few more times, and the decree was not renewed in 1943.

The NDH retained the court system of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]], but restored the courts' names to their original forms. The state had 172 local courts (''kotar''), 19 district courts (''judicial tables''), an administrative court and an appellate court (''Ban's Table'') in both [[Zagreb]] and [[Sarajevo]], as well as a supreme court (Table of Seven) in Zagreb and a supreme court in Sarajevo.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pravst.hr/zbornik.php?p=12&s=40 |title=Pravni fakultet Split <U+2013> Zbornik |publisher=Pravst.hr |accessdate=3 June 2011}}</ref> The state maintained men's penitentiaries in [[Lepoglava prison|Lepoglava]], Hrvatska Mitrovica, Stara Gradi<U+0161>ka and Zenica, and a women's penitentiary in Zagreb.<ref>Kova<U+010D>i<U+0107>, Darko.

===Military===
{{See also|Army of the Independent State of Croatia|Usta<U+0161>e militia|Air Force of the Independent State of Croatia}}
The NDH founded the [[Army of the Independent State of Croatia]] ({{lang-sh|Hrvatsko domobranstvo}}) and [[Navy of the Independent State of Croatia]] in April 1941 with the consent of the German armed forces (''[[Wehrmacht]]''). The task of the armed forces was to defend the state against both foreign and domestic enemies.<ref>[[#Tomasevich-OaC|Tomasevich, 2001]], p. 419</ref> The Army included an [[Air Force of the Independent State of Croatia|air force]]. The NDH also created the ''Usta<U+0161>ka Vojnica'' ([[Usta<U+0161>e militia]]) which was conceived as a party militia, and a [[gendarmerie]].

The Army was originally limited to 16 [[infantry]] [[battalions]] and 2 [[cavalry]] [[Squadron (cavalry)|squadrons]] <U+2013> 16,000 men in total. The original 16 battalions were soon enlarged to 15 infantry regiments of two battalions each between May and June 1941, organised into five divisional commands, some 55,000 men.<ref>Thomas, 1995, p.12</ref> Support units included 35 light tanks supplied by Italy,<ref>[[#Tomasevich-OaC|Tomasevich, 2001]], p. 420</ref> 10 artillery battalions (equipped with captured [[Royal Yugoslav Army]] weapons of Czech origin), a cavalry regiment in Zagreb and an independent cavalry battalion at Sarajevo. Two independent motorized infantry battalions were based at Zagreb and Sarajevo respectively.<ref>Thomas, 1995, p.13</ref>

Under the terms of the Rome Agreement with Italy, the NDH navy was restricted to a few coastal and patrol craft, which mostly patrolled [[inland waterway]]s.

When established in 1941, the [[Air Force of the Independent State of Croatia]] ({{lang-sh|Zrakoplovstvo Nezavisne Dr<U+017E>ave Hrvatske}}) (ZNDH), consisted of captured Royal Yugoslav aircraft (seven operational fighters, 20 bombers and about 180 auxiliary and training aircraft) as well as paratroop, training and anti-aircraft artillery commands. During the course of the war on the [[Yugoslav Front]] it was supplemented with several hundred new or overhauled German, Italian and French fighters and bombers, until receiving the final deliveries of new aircraft from Germany in April 1945.<ref>Lisko, T. and Canak, D., Hrvatsko Ratno Zrakoplovstvo u Drugome Svejetskom Ratu (The Croatian Air force in the Second World War) Zagreb, 1998</ref>

The unit returned to Croatia in December 1942.]]
The Croatian Air Force Legion ({{lang-sh|Hrvatska Zrakoplovna Legija}}), or HZL, was a military unit of the [[Air Force of the Independent State of Croatia]] which fought alongside the [[Luftwaffe]] on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] from 1941 to 1943 and then back on Croatian soil. The unit was sent to Germany for training on 15 July 1941 before heading to the Eastern Front. Many of the pilots and crews had previously served in the [[Royal Yugoslav Air Force]] during the [[Invasion of Yugoslavia]] in April 1941. Some of them also had experience in the two main types that they would operate, the [[Messerschmitt 109]] and [[Dornier Do 17]], with two fighter pilots having actually shot down [[Luftwaffe]] aircraft.<ref>Savic, D. and Ciglic, B. Croatian Aces of World War II Osprey Aircraft of the Aces <U+2013> 49, Oxford, 2002</ref>

During operations over the Eastern Front, the unit's fighters scored a total of 283 kills while its bombers participated in some 1,500 combat missions. Upon return to Croatia from December 1942, the unit's aircraft proved a welcome addition to the strike power of the [[Axis powers|Axis]] forces fighting the [[Yugoslav Partisans]] on the [[Yugoslav Front]] right up to the end of 1944.<ref>Lisko, et al., 1998, p. 34.</ref>

Because of low morale among Army conscripts and their increasing disaffection with the Usta<U+0161>a regime as the war progressed, the [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisans]] came to regard them as a key element in their supply line. According to William Deakin, who led one of the British missions to the Partisan commander-in-chief [[Josip Broz Tito]], in some areas, Partisans would release Army soldiers after disarming them, so they could come back into the field with replacement weapons, which would again be seized.<ref>F W D Deakin: Embattled Mountain, Oxford University Press (London 1971)</ref> Other Army soldiers either defected or actively channelled supplies to the Partisans<U+2014>particularly after the NDH ceded [[Dalmatia]] to Italy. Army troop numbers dwindled from 130,000 in early 1943 to 70,000 by late 1944, at which point the NDH government amalgamated the Army with the Usta<U+0161>e Army and was organised into eighteen divisions, including artillery and armoured units.<ref>[[#Tomasevich-OaC|Tomasevich, 2001]], p. 459</ref>

Despite these difficulties, the Army, along with the German-commanded XV [[Cossack]] Corps, was able to assist the [[Wehrmacht]] to hold its lines in [[Syrmia]], [[Slavonia]] and [[Bosnia]] against the combined [[Soviet Union|Soviet]], Bulgarian and Partisan offensives from late 1944 to shortly before the NDH collapse in May 1945.

The [[Air Force of the Independent State of Croatia]] provided some level of air support (attack, fighter and transport) right up until May 1945, encountering and sometimes defeating opposing aircraft from the British [[Royal Air Force]], [[United States Air Force]] and the [[Soviet Air Force]]. The final deliveries of up-to-date German [[Messerschmitt 109]]G and K fighter aircraft were still taking place in April 1945.<ref>Ciglic, et al., 2007, p. 150</ref>

By the end of March 1945, it was obvious to the Croatian Army Command that, although the front remained intact, they would eventually be defeated by sheer lack of ammunition. For this reason, the decision was made to retreat into Austria, in order to surrender to the British forces advancing north from Italy.<ref>Shaw, 1973, p.101</ref> The German Army was in the process of disintegration and the supply system lay in ruins.<ref>Ambrose, 1998, p.335</ref>

The Croatian Army remained engaged in battle a week after the capitulation of Germany on 8 May 1945. At that time, the combined fighting forces numbered some 200,000 troops.<ref>Munoz, A.J., For Croatia and Christ: The Croatian Army in World War II 1941<U+2013>1945 Axis Europa Books (Bayside NY, 1996)</ref>

===Currency===
The NDH currency was the [[Independent State of Croatia kuna]]. The Croatian State Bank was the [[central bank]], responsible for issuing currency.

===Railways===
The NDH formed the Croatian State Railways after the [[Yugoslav Railways]] was dissolved, and Serbian State Railways in Serbia was devolved.<ref>[http://www.slo-zeleznice.si/en/about_us/the_history_of_slovenske_zeleznice/ The history of Slovenske <U+017E>eleznice]{{dead link|date=June 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://hrcak.srce.hr/file/11118 |title=Organization of the Croatian State Railways |accessdate=3 June 2011}}</ref>

=={{anchor|Occupation zones}} Zones of influence==
From 1941 to 1943, territory of the Independent State of Croatia was divided into German and Italian zones, sometimes described as zones of influence{{sfn|Baumann|Gawrych|Kretchik|2012|p=13}}<ref name="Frucht-p429"/><ref>[[#Pavlowitch_2008|Pavlowitch (2008)]], p. 15</ref> and sometimes as occupation zones:<ref>[[#Cohen-Riesman|Cohen, Riesman, 1996]], [http://books.google.com/books?id=Fz1PW_wnHYMC&pg=PA91 p. 91]</ref><ref>[[#Hoare_2006|Hoare (2006)]], p. 15</ref>
* The German zone, which included the northeastern part of NDH, bordering [[Hungary during World War II|Hungary]] in the north, German-occupied [[Serbia (1941-1944)|Serbia]] in the east, the Italian zone in the south, and [[Nazi Germany]] in the north-west.<ref name="demarcation-map">[http://terkepek.adatbank.transindex.ro/kepek/netre/211.gif Map of the zone] {{hu icon}}</ref> There, the German armed forces (''[[Wehrmacht]]'') exercised ''de facto'' control.
* The Italian zone, which included the southwestern part of the NDH, bordering the German zone in the north-east, Italian-occupied [[Montenegro (1941-1944)|Montenegro]] in the east, and Yugoslav territories annexed by [[Kingdom of Italy (1861<U+2013>1946)|Italy]] in the south-west.<ref name="demarcation-map"/>

After the capitulation of Italy in 1943, the Italian zone of influence was abolished and the German zone of influence was expanded to the whole Independent State of Croatia.
At the same time, the NDH acquired control of northern Dalmatia (Split and [[<U+0160>ibenik]]).

==Politics==
Under the Independent State of Croatia all parties but the Usta<U+0161>e party were banned.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bosworth |first=R.J.B.|title=The Oxford Handbook of Fascism|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-929131-1|page=431}}</ref>

==Economy==

===German influences===

In the Independent State of Croatia, which the Germans formally treated as a sovereign state, most, if not all, industrial and economic activity was either monopolized, or given a high priority for exploitation, by Germany.

Agreements between the two governments in mid 1941 regulated foreign trade and payments and the export of Croatian labour to Germany. Germany already controlled a large number of industrial and mining enterprises in Croatia that were owned in part or in full by German citizens or citizens of German-occupied countries. Many other enterprises in Croatia, especially in the bauxite mining and timber industries, were leased to the Germans for the duration of the war. The Germans also held large interests in Croatian commercial banks, exercised either directly by banks in Berlin and [[Vienna]], or indirectly, by German banks that had large interests in [[Prague]] and [[Budapest]] banks.<ref>[[#Tomasevich-OaC|Tomasevich, 2001]], p. 621</ref>

From the beginning, the Germans showed great interest in the high-quality iron ore mines of Ljubija in northwest [[Bosnia]], in the industrial complex (steel, coal and heavy chemicals) in the [[Sarajevo]]<U+2013>[[Tuzla]]<U+2013>[[Zenica]] triangle in northeast Bosnia, and in bauxite. As the war advanced and German military involvement in Croatia expanded, more and more Croatian industry was put to work for the Germans. The bauxite mines in [[Hercegovina]], [[Dalmatia]] and western [[Bosnia]], were in the Italian zone of occupation, but their total production was earmarked for German needs for the duration of the war under the German-Italian agreement of 1941.<ref>[[#Tomasevich-OaC|Tomasevich, 2001]], p. 641</ref>

Other Croatian industrial assets utilized by the Germans included the production of brown coal and lignite, cement (major plants in [[Zagreb]] and [[Split (city)|Split]]), oil and salt.
Crude oil production, from fields to the east of Zagreb developed by the American Vacuum Oil Company, only started in November 1941 and never reached a high level, averaging {{convert|24000|oilbbl}} a month in mid 1944.

The most important commodities manufactured in Croatia for German use were  prefabricated barracks (utilizing the large Croatian timber industry), clothing, dry-cell batteries, bridge construction parts and ammunition (grenades).

The [[Vares]] iron ore mine supplied the steel mill at Zenica, which had a capacity of 120,000 tons of steel annually. The Zenica mill, in turn, supplied the state arsenal in Sarajevo and the machinery and railroad car factory in [[Slavonski Brod]], both of which produced various items for the [[Wehrmacht]] during the war, including grenades and shell casings. Some Vares iron ore was also exported to Italy, Hungary and [[Romania]].<ref>[[#Tomasevich-OaC|Tomasevich, 2001]], p. 646</ref>

===Italian influence===

The region of the NDH controlled by Italy had few natural resources and little industry.{{Dubious|date=September 2011}} There were some important timber stands, several cement plants, an aluminium plant at Lozovac, a carbide and chemical fertilizer plant at Dugi Rat, and a ferromanganese and cast iron plant near [[<U+0160>ibenik]], ship building operations in Split, a few brown coal mines supplying fuel to railways, shipping and industry, and rich bauxite fields.<ref>[[#Tomasevich-OaC|Tomasevich, 2001]], p. 660</ref>

==Demographics==

=== Population ===
According to data calculated by the [[German Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] during the creation of the state the population was approximately 6,285,000 of which 3,300,000 were [[Croats]], 1,925,000 were [[Serbs]], 700,000 were [[Bosniaks|Muslims]], 150,000 [[Germans]], 65,000 [[Czechs]] and [[Slovaks]], 40,000 Jews, and 30,000 [[Slovenes]]. Croats comprised slightly over half of the population of the Independent State of Croatia. With Muslims treated as Croats the Croat share of the total population was still less than two-thirds.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hoare |first=Marko Attila |title=Genocide and Resistance in Hitler's Bosnia: The Partisans and the Chetniks |year=2006 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-726380-1 |page=19}}</ref>

=== Displacement of people ===
A large number of people were displaced due to internal fighting within the former Yugoslav republic. The NDH had to accept more than 200,000 [[Slovenia]]n refugees who were forcefully evicted from their homes as part of the German plan of annexing parts of the Slovenian territories. As part of this deal, the Usta<U+0161>e were to deport 200,000 Serbs from Croatia military regions; however, only 182,000 had been deported when German high commander Bader stopped this mass transport of people because of the uprising of Chetniks and partisans in [[Serbia]]{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}. Because of this, 25,000 Slovenian refugees ended in Serbia.

Internal colonization to the region of [[Slavonia]] was encouraged during this period from [[Dalmatia]], [[Lika]], [[Hrvatsko Zagorje]] and [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]].<ref>I. Balta.

== Racial legislation ==
{{See also|World War II persecution of Serbs|The Holocaust in Croatia|Porajmos|Concentration camps in the Independent State of Croatia}}

On the first day of his arrival in Zagreb, [[Ante Paveli<U+0107>]] proclaimed a law that remained in effect during the entire period of the Independent State of Croatia. The law, which was enacted on 17 April 1941, declared that all people who offend, or try to offend, the Croatian nation are guilty of treason<U+2014>a crime punishable by death.<ref name="crohis">{{cite web|url=http://www.crohis.com/izvori/ustzk.pdf |title=Independent State of Croatia laws on Croatian <U+2013> Zakonske osnove progona politickih protivnika i rasno nepodobnih u NDH |format=PDF |accessdate=3 June 2011}}</ref> One day later, the first Croatian [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] racial law was published. This law did not create panic among the Jewish population, because they believed it was merely a continuation of the antisemitic laws of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, which were proclaimed in 1939.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://web.ceu.hu/jewishstudies/pdf/02_goldstein.pdf | title=Jews in Yugoslavia 1918<U+2013>41: Antisemitism and the Struggle for Equality | last=Goldstein | first=Ivo | authorlink=Ivo Goldstein | publisher=[[Central European University]] | accessdate=7 February 2010}}</ref> However, the situation quickly changed on 30 April, with the publication of the [[Aryan race]] laws.

A notable part of the racial legislation was the religious conversion laws, the implications of which were not understood by the majority of the population when they were published on 3 May 1941. The implications become clear following the July speech of the minister of education, [[Mile Budak]], in which he declared: "We will kill one third of all Serbs. We will deport another third, and the rest of them will be forced to convert to Catholicism." Racial laws were enforced until 3 May 1945, when they were abolished.<ref name="crohis" />

The NDH government cooperated with Nazi Germany in [[the Holocaust]] and exercised their own version of the [[genocide]] against ethnic Serbs living within their borders. State policy regarding Serbs was first declared in the words of Miroslav <U+017D>ani<U+0107>, the minister of the NDH Legislative council on 2 May 1941: "This country can only be a Croatian country, and there is no method we would hesitate to use in order to make it truly Croatian and cleanse it of Serbs, who have for centuries endangered us and who will endanger us again if they are given the opportunity."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pdffiles/PUB159.pdf |title=Deciphering the Balkan Enigma: Using History to Inform Policy |format=PDF |accessdate=3 June 2011}}</ref>

At least 330,000 Serbs, 30,000 Jews and 30,000 Roma were killed during the NDH, particularly in the Jasenovac concentration camp<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/article.php?lang=en&ModuleId=10005449 |title=United States Holocaust Memorial Museum about Jasenovac and Independent State of Croatia |publisher=Ushmm.org |accessdate=3 June 2011}}</ref><ref>''Genocide and Resistance in Hitler's Bosnia: The Partisans and the Chetniks, 1941<U+2013>1943'' pp20</ref> and the same number of Serbs were forced out of the NDH. Although the Ustase's main target for persecution were the Serbs, it also participated in the destruction of the Jewish population. The NDH deviated from Nazi anti-Semitic policy by promising honorary Aryan citizenship to some Jews, if they were willing to enlist and fight for the NDH.<ref name="Tomasevich-p226" />

According to the 1931 and 1948 census, the Serb population declined in Croatia and increased in Bosnia:

== Culture ==
Soon after establishment of the NDH, the Yugoslav Academy of Science and Arts{{Where|date=October 2012}} was renamed the [[Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts]]. The country had four state theatres: [[Croatian National Theatre in Zagreb|Zagreb]], [[Osijek]], [[Dubrovnik]] and in [[Sarajevo National Theatre|Sarajevo]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.matica.hr/Vijenac/vijenac338.nsf/AllWebDocs/Povratak_zaboravljene_glumice |title=Matica hrvatska <U+2013> Povratak zaboravljene glumice |publisher=Matica.hr |date=16 November 2001 |accessdate=3 June 2011}}</ref><ref>[http://www.kazaliste-dubrovnik.hr/povijest.shtml Kazali<U+0161>te u Dubrovniku do osnutka prvoga profesionalnog ansambla]{{dead link|date=June 2011}}</ref> The Croatian State Theatre in Zagreb played host to the [[Berlin Philharmonic]] and the [[Teatro dell'Opera di Roma]] in the 1941/42 season.<ref>[http://www.ief.hr/lib/attachment.php?id=53 Popular practice of national music during the Second World War]{{dead link|date=June 2011}}</ref> Volumes two to five of [[Mate Ujevi<U+0107>]]'s ''[[Croatian Encyclopedia]]'' were published during this period. The NDH was represented at the 1942 [[Venice Biennale]], where the works of Joza Kljakovi<U+0107>, [[Ivan Me<U+0161>trovi<U+0107>]], Ante Motika, Ivo Re<U+017E>ek, Bruno Buli<U+0107>, Josip Crnobori, Antun Medi<U+0107>, Slavko Kopa<U+010D> and Slavko <U+0160>ohaj were presented by Vladimir Kirin.

The existing [[University of Zagreb]] was renamed the Croatian University ({{lang-sh|Hrvatsko sveu<U+010D>ili<U+0161>te}}), and was the only university in the NDH. The university established a pharmaceutical faculty in 1942,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pharma.hr/Odsjek.aspx?mhID=3&mvID=58 |title=Povijesni pregled Zavoda za mikrobiologiju Farmaceutsko-biokemijskog fakulteta Sveu<U+010D>ili<U+0161>ta u Zagrebu |publisher=Pharma.hr |accessdate=3 June 2011}}</ref> and a medical faculty in Sarajevo in 1944.<ref>[http://www.mf.unsa.ba/english/ Medical Faculty of Sarajevo University Mission Statement]{{dead link|date=June 2011}}</ref> It also opened the [[University Hospital Centre Zagreb|University Hospital Zagreb]], which later became one of the largest hospitals in Croatia.

The state had two secular holidays; the anniversary of its establishment was commemorated on 10 April and the assassination of Stjepan Radi<U+0107> was commemorated on 20 June.<ref name="Pozar">Po<U+017E>ar, Petar (editor).

On 29 April 1941 the ''Decree on building Croatian workers' family homes'' was issued which resulted in the development of so-called ''Paveli<U+0107> neighbourhoods'' in the state's larger northern cities: Karlovac, Osijek, Sisak, Vara<U+017E>din, and Zagreb.<ref>[http://www.matica.hr/Vijenac/vij227.nsf/AllWebDocs/mhaa Arhitektura u Nezavisnoj Dr<U+017E>avi Hrvatskoj (1941<U+2013>1945), I. dio], [[Vijenac]]</ref> The neighbourhoods were largely based on similar workers housing in Germany.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hrcak.srce.hr/file/48582 |title=Projekt Marijana Haberlea za Provincijalat franjevaca konventualaca u Sisku iz 1943. godine |accessdate=3 June 2011}}</ref> They are characterized by their wide avenues and lots, and for largely being made up of semi-detached homes.<ref>Martin<U+010D>i<U+0107>, Julijo.
