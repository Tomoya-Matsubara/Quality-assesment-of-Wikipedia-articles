'''Strasbourg-Ortenau''' is a [[France|Franco]]-[[Germany|German]] [[eurodistrict]], a cross border administrative project with some common institutions, established on 17 October 2005. The district is formed by the [[Urban Community of Strasbourg]] (centred on the city of [[Strasbourg]]) on the French side of the [[Rhine]] and the [[Ortenaukreis|Ortenau district]] (including [[Achern]], [[Kehl]], [[Lahr]], [[Oberkirch (Baden)|Oberkirch]] and [[Offenburg]]) on the German side.<ref name="welcome">[http://www.eurodistrict.eu/fr/index.php?page=accueil Bienvenue sur le site de l<U+2019>Eurodistrict Strasbourg-Ortenau], district official website {{fr}}</ref> In 2006, the combined population of the district was 868,014 and covered an area of 2,176 [[km<U+00B2>]].<ref name="stats">[http://www.eurodistrict.eu/fr/index.php?page=donnees&menu=menu5 Eurodistrict stats], district official website {{fr}}</ref>

Building on regional and [[Franco-German cooperation]], it aims to develop bonds between citizens, associations, public administrations, educational establishments and corporations. It is also in the context of [[European integration]], with the presence of [[European institutions in Strasbourg]],<ref name="welcome"/> and has been compared to a European version of [[Washington D.C.]]. In addititon to the array of European and Franco-German institutions, the district includes three [[port]]s, two [[airports]] and nine [[University|universities]].<ref name="stats"/>

[[List of mayors of Strasbourg|Mayor of Strasbourg]] [[Roland Ries]], during and after his election campaign, proposed the strengthening district in order to maintain the presence of the [[European Parliament]] in the city (see [[Location of European Union institutions]]) and making it more autonomous and akin to a European [[Capital districts and territories|capital territory]]). However the Ortenaukreis communities have been less enthusiastic about the Eurodistrict project.<ref>[http://www.cafebabel.com/eng/article/24219/europe-dominates-election-agenda-in-strasbourg.html Europe dominates election agenda in Strasbourg], Cafe babel</ref>

== History ==
The idea of an Eurodistrict Strasbourg-Kehl (as it was called then) was officially launched on January 22, 2003, by French President [[Jacques Chirac]] and German Federal Chancellor [[Gerhard Schr<U+00F6>der]] during a meeting in the [[<U+00C9>lys<U+00E9>e Palace|Palais de l'Elys<U+00E9>e]]; it was point 24 of the common declaration made on the 40th anniversary of the cooperation treaty between Germany and France. January 22 was furthermore declared "French-German day" (''journ<U+00E9>e franco-allemande'', ''deutsch-franz<U+00F6>sischer Tag'')<ref>[http://www.eurodistrict.eu/docs/F_DeclarationCommuneChiracSchroder.pdf DECLARATION COMMUNE FRANCO-ALLEMANDE A L'OCCASION DU 40EME ANNIVERSAIRE DU TRAITE DE L'ELYSEE] {{fr icon}}</ref>
