==Personal life==
Zakaria Abdulla, was born in [[Arbil]], [[Northern Iraq]], into a musical family. From his early childhood, he spent most of his interest and time on music. As a refugee, Zakaria moved through several countries before settling in [[Sweden]].

==Career==
Breaking away from traditional 2-beat march-like rhythms used in Kurdish music, Zakaria began blending other genres into his music, defining a new style of post-modern Kurdish popular music. Zakaria has an established young fan base, but his music appeals to people of all ages. 
===1998-2003===
In 1998, his first album ''To Hat<U+00EE>'' (trans: "You Came") was well received by Kurdish audiences worldwide. It was recorded with the help of a popular Swedish musician. ''To Hat<U+00EE>'' was released as first music video in his career. 

Late on 1999, he released his second album ''Biger<U+00EA>we'' (trans: "Come Back"), with some Kurdish musicians in Sweden. ''Big<U+00EA>rewe'', filmed in Sweden, was the only track with a video in this album. 

In 2001 he released his third album ''Daye'' (trans: "Mom"), which comprised a mix of [[Fantezi]] and [[pop music]]. The videos for the tracks ''Daye'' and ''Bo<U+00E7><U+00EE> hat<U+00EE>'' (trans: "Why Did You Came?") were shot in [[Arbil]].

In 2002, Zakaria released his silver album ''Rojgar'' (trans: "Days"), selling more than 1,500,000 copies. The album was recorded in [[Turkey]]. In this work, Zakaria used for the most Fantezi style. The hit video track from this album, ''Netb<U+00EE>nim'' (trans: "If I Don't See You") was shot in [[Istanbul]], later he made a video for the song ''Rojgar''. The last video from this album was the kurdish dance hit ''Tu naza neke'' shot in [[Diyarbakir]].

===2004-Present===
His next album ''T<U+00EA>linaz'' (trans: "Lovely"), released in October 2004, sold more than 3 million copies worldwide, introducing him to non-Kurdish audiences. ''T<U+00EA>linaz'' was recorded in Turkey, and comprised a mix of Fantezi and [[Pop music]]. The video for the song ''T<U+00EA>linaz'' was shot in [[Istanbul]] with a large number of dancers and was also broadcasted in [[Turkish television]]. The soundtechnique who was used was very high.

Zakaria released his latest album in January 2007, titled ''Genc<U+00EE> P<U+00EE>r'' (trans.: "Old youth"). The album was largely a work of Fantezi spiced up with [[pop music]] and [[R&B]].  The song ''Roji Bextim'' became a successful [[R&B]] hit. Zakaria shot a music video for this album in [[Istanbul]] and [[Cappadocia]], called ''Gull<U+00EA>'' (trans: "Rose"), with a famous Italian model playing the leading role. The video, released on December 25, was welcomed as a Christmas present by many Kurdish people.
