The '''Calgary Stampede''' is an annual [[rodeo]], [[fair|exhibition]] and [[festival]] held every July in [[Calgary]], [[Alberta]], Canada.  The ten-day event, which bills itself as "The Greatest Outdoor Show on Earth",<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/story/2008/07/04/stampede-parade.html |title=Yahoo! Stampede parade kicks off 'greatest outdoor show on earth' |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |date=2008-07-04 |accessdate=2011-07-09}}</ref> attracts over one million visitors per year and features the world's largest rodeo, a [[parade]], [[Midway (fair)|midway]], [[stage show]]s, [[concert]]s, agricultural competitions, [[chuckwagon racing]] and [[First Nations]] exhibitions. 

The event's roots are traced to 1886 when the Calgary and District Agricultural Society held its first fair. American promoter [[Guy Weadick]] launched his first rodeo and festival in 1912 and returned to Calgary in 1919 to organize the Victory Stampede in honour soldiers returning from World War I.  It became an annual event in 1923 when Weadick's festival merged with the Calgary Industrial Exhibition to create the '''Calgary Exhibition and Stampede'''.   

Organized by thousands of volunteers and supported by civic leaders, the Calgary Stampede has grown into one of the world's richest rodeos, one of Canada's largest festivals and a significant tourist attraction for the city.  Rodeo and chuckwagon racing events are televised across Canada.  However, both have been the target of increasing criticism by [[animal welfare]] groups concerned about particular events as well as [[animal rights]] organizations seeking to ban rodeo in general.

Calgary's national and international identity is tied to the event. It is known as the "Stampede City", carries the informal nickname of "Cowtown" and the local [[Canadian Football League]] team is called the [[Calgary Stampeders|Stampeders]].  The city takes on a party atmosphere during Stampede: office buildings and storefronts are painted in cowboy themes, residents don [[western wear]] and events held across the city include hundreds of pancake breakfasts and [[barbecue]]s.

==History==
[[File:Program for 1912 Calgary Stampede.jpg|thumb|right|The Program for the 1912 Calgary Stampede featuring the [[The Big Four (Calgary)|Big Four]]: Burns, Lane, Cross, and McLean|alt=A poster featuring a man riding a bucking horse on an open prairie field.  In each corner is a photograph of four different middle-aged well-dressed gentlemen.]]
The Calgary and District Agricultural Society was formed in 1884 to promote the town and encourage farmers and ranchers from eastern Canada to move west. The society held its first [[fair]] two years later, attracting a quarter of the town's 2,000 residents.<ref name="GuysDream">{{citation |last=Dudley |first=Wendy |title=Guy's Stampede dream |work=Calgary Herald |date=1997-07-03 |page=SS2}}</ref> By 1889, it had acquired land on the banks of the [[Elbow River]] to host the exhibitions, but crop failures, poor weather and a declining economy resulted in the society ceasing operations in 1895.<ref>{{harvnb|Dixon|Read|2005|p=26}}</ref> The land passed briefly to future [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[R. B. Bennett]] who sold it to the city.  The area was called [[Beltline, Calgary|Victoria Park]], after [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]], and the newly formed Western Pacific Exhibition Company hosted its first agricultural and industrial fair in 1899.<ref>{{harvnb|Dixon|Read|2005|p=27}}</ref>  

The exhibition grew annually, and in 1908 the Government of Canada announced that Calgary would host the federally funded Dominion Exhibition that year.  Seeking to take advantage of the opportunity to promote itself, the city spent [[Canadian dollar|C$]]145,000 to build six new pavilions and a racetrack.<ref name="Dixon29">{{harvnb|Dixon|Read|2005|p=29}}</ref> It held a lavish parade, [[rodeo]], horse racing and [[trick roping]] competitions as part of the event.<ref name="GuysDream" />  The exhibition was a success, drawing 100,000 people to the fairgrounds over seven days despite an economic recession that afflicted the city of 25,000.<ref name="Dixon29" /> 

[[Guy Weadick]], an American trick roper who participated in the Dominion Exhibition as part of the [[Miller Brothers 101 Ranch]] Real Wild West Show, returned to Calgary in 1912 in the hopes of establishing an event that more accurately represented the "wild west" than the shows he was a part of.<ref>{{harvnb|Dixon|Read|2005|p=30}}</ref>  With the assistance of local livestock agent H. C. McMullen, Weadick convinced businessmen [[Patrick Burns (politician)|Pat Burns]], [[George Lane (politician)|George Lane]], [[Archie McLean (politician)|A. J. MacLean]], and [[A. E. Cross]] to put up $100,000 to guarantee funding for the event.<ref name="GuysDream" /> The [[Big Four (Calgary)|Big Four]], as they came to be known, viewed the project as a final celebration of their life as cattlemen.<ref>{{harvnb|Foran|2008|p=5}}</ref> The city built a rodeo arena on the fairgrounds and over 100,000 people attended the six-day event in September 1912 to watch hundreds of cowboys from Western Canada, the United States and Mexico compete for $20,000 in prizes.<ref>{{harvnb|Dixon|Read|2005|p=32}}</ref> The event generated $120,000 in revenue and was hailed as a success.<ref name="GuysDream" />  

Weadick set about planning the 1913 Stampede, promoting the event across North America.  However, the Big Four were not interested in hosting another such event.<ref>{{harvnb|Kennedy|1965|p=22}}</ref> Businessmen in [[Winnipeg]] convinced Weadick to host his second Stampede in their city, but the show failed financially.  A third attempt held in [[New York]] State in 1916 suffered the same fate.<ref name="Kennedy23">{{harvnb|Kennedy|1965|p=23}}</ref> Weadick returned to Calgary in 1919 where he gained the support of E. L. Richardson, the general manager of the Calgary Industrial Exhibition.  The two convinced numerous Calgarians, including the Big Four, to back the "Great Victory Stampede" in celebration of Canada's soldiers returning from [[World War I]].<ref name="Kennedy23" />  

===Calgary Exhibition and Stampede===
While the 1919 Stampede was successful, it was again held as a one-time event.  Richardson was convinced that it could be a profitable annual event but found little support for the concept within the board of directors of the Calgary Industrial Exhibition. However, declining attendance and mounting financial losses forced the exhibition board to reconsider Richardson's proposals at their 1922 annual meeting.<ref name="Kennedy28">{{harvnb|Kennedy|1965|p=28}}</ref>  Richardson proposed merging the two events on a trial basis. Weadick agreed, and the union created the Calgary Exhibition and Stampede.<ref name="Dixon36">{{harvnb|Dixon|Read|2005|p=36}}</ref>  

[[File:1923 Calgary Stampede parade.jpg|thumb|left|1923 Stampede parade|alt=Hundreds of men on horseback march down a city street as people observe from the sidewalks and rooftops.]]
The combined event was first held in 1923. Weadick encouraged the city's residents to dress in western clothes and decorate their businesses in the spirit of the "wild west".<ref name="GuysDream" />  Civic leaders truly supported the event for the first time: Mayor [[George Harry Webster|George Webster]] followed the costume suggestion and allowed downtown roads to be closed for two hours each morning of the six-day event to accommodate street parties.<ref name="Dixon36" /> The new sport of [[chuckwagon racing]] was introduced and proved immediately popular.<ref>{{citation |title=2009 Calgary Stampede Evening Show Program |publisher=Calgary Stampede |page=8}}</ref> 138,950 people attended and the event earned a profit.<ref name="Dixon36" />  Over 167,000 people attended in 1924 and the success guaranteed that the Stampede and Exhibition would be held together permanently.<ref name="Dixon38">{{harvnb|Dixon|Read|2005|p=38}}</ref>

Attendance grew annually throughout the 1920s, peaking at 258,496 in 1928, but the onset of the [[Great Depression]] resulted in attendance declines and financial losses. After consecutive years of losses in 1930 and 1931, the exhibition board was forced to make cutbacks, a decision that strained the relationship between the board and Weadick.<ref name="Kennedy41">{{harvnb|Kennedy|1965|p=41}}</ref>  Furthering the divide was Weadick's growing resentment of the board's control of what he considered his event.  The issue came to a head in 1932 when Weadick and Richardson engaged in a loud argument over the situation, ending with Weadick's threat to quit entirely.<ref>{{harvnb|Livingstone|1996|p=110}}</ref> One month later, the exhibition board announced that it had relieved him of his duties.<ref name="Kennedy41" /> Angered by the decision, Weadick sued the exhibition board for $100,000, citing breach of contract and unfair dismissal.<ref>{{harvnb|Livingstone|1996|p=111}}</ref>  His claim was upheld in courts, but he was awarded only $2,750 plus legal fees.<ref>{{harvnb|Kennedy|1965|p=42}}</ref>  Embittered by the events, Weadick remained at odds with the board for 20 years until he was invited to the 1952 Stampede as an honoured guest and parade marshal.<ref>{{harvnb|Livingstone|1996|p=120}}</ref>

At least seven movies were filmed at the Stampede by 1950.  The most profitable, the 1925 [[silent movie|silent film]] ''The Calgary Stampede'', used footage from the rodeo and exposed people across North America to the event.<ref name="Foran10">{{harvnb|Foran|2008|p=10}}</ref> [[Hollywood]] stars and foreign dignitaries were attracted to the Stampede; [[Bob Hope]] and [[Bing Crosby]] each served as parade marshals during the 1950s,<ref name="Dixon42">{{harvnb|Dixon|Read|2005|p=42}}</ref> while Queen [[Elizabeth II]] and Prince [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Philip]] made their first of two visits to the event as part of their 1959 tour of Canada.<ref>{{citation |url=http://archives.cbc.ca/on_this_day/07/09/ |title=A royal Calgary Stampede |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |accessdate=2010-05-18}}</ref>  The Queen also opened the 1973 Stampede.<ref name="Dixon43">{{harvnb|Dixon|Read|2005|p=43}}</ref>

===Expansion===
The discovery of the [[Leduc No. 1]] oil well in 1946 and major reserves in the [[Turner Valley, Alberta|Turner Valley]] area southwest of the city ushered in a period of growth and prosperity. Calgary was transformed from an agricultural community into the oil and gas capital of Canada.<ref name="Gray136">{{harvnb|Gray|1985|p=136}}</ref> The city's population nearly doubled between 1949 and 1956, and Calgary's immigrant population not only embraced the Stampede, but encouraged friends and family in their home towns to do the same.<ref name="Gray136" />  The 1950s represented the golden age of the Calgary Stampede.<ref name="Gray137">{{harvnb|Gray|1985|p=137}}</ref>

[[File:Steerwrestling-c01.jpg|thumb|right|A cowboy attempts to wrestle a steer to the ground.|alt=A man, having just lept from his horse, has wrapped his arms around a steer's neck in an attempt to drive it to the ground.  Two other men on horseback follow close behind.]]
Attendance records were broken nearly every year in the 1950s and overall attendance increased by 200,000 from 1949 to 1959.<ref name="Gray144">{{harvnb|Gray|1985|p=144}}</ref>  The growth necessitated expansion of the exhibition grounds.<ref name="Dixon43" />  The 7,500-seat [[Stampede Corral]] was completed in 1950 as the largest indoor arena in Western Canada.<ref name="Foran12">{{harvnb|Foran|2008|p=12}}</ref> It housed the [[Calgary Stampeders (ice hockey)|Calgary Stampeders]] hockey team, which was operated by the Board of Governors and won the [[Western Hockey League (minor pro)|Western Hockey League]] championship in 1954.<ref name="Gray142">{{harvnb|Gray|1985|p=142}}</ref>  Acts such as the [[Minnesota Orchestra|Minneapolis Symphony Orchestra]] and [[Louis Armstrong]] played the Corral, although the arena's poor acoustics were a frequent concern to organizers and patrons.<ref name="Gray140">{{harvnb|Gray|1985|p=140}}</ref>

Improvements were made to the grandstand and the race track was rebuilt in 1954.<ref name="Gray143">{{harvnb|Gray|1985|p=143}}</ref> The Big Four Building, named in honour of the Stampede's benefactors, opened in 1959 to serve as the city's largest exhibition hall in the summer,<ref name="Dixon42" /> and was converted into a 24-sheet [[curling]] facility each winter.<ref name="Gray143"/>  The improvements failed to alleviate all the pressures growth had caused: chronic parking shortages and inability to accommodate demand for tickets to the rodeo and grandstand shows continued.<ref name="Gray143" />

Attendance continued to grow throughout the 1960s and 1970s, topping 500,000 for the first time in 1962 and reaching 654,000 in 1966. Organizers expanded the event from six days to nine in 1967 and then to ten the following year.<ref name="Dixon43" /> The Stampede exceeded one million visitors for the first time in 1976.<ref name="GuysDream" />  The park, meanwhile, continued to grow.  The Round-Up Centre opened in 1979 as the new exhibition hall, and the [[Scotiabank Saddledome|Olympic Saddledome]] was completed in 1983.<ref name="Dixon44">{{harvnb|Dixon|Read|2005|p=44}}</ref>  The Saddledome replaced the Corral as the city's top sporting arena, and both facilities hosted [[ice hockey at the 1988 Winter Olympics|hockey]] and [[figure skating at the 1988 Winter Olympics|figure skating]] events at the [[1988 Winter Olympics]].<ref name="Dixon44" />  

Maintaining the traditional focus on agriculture and western heritage remained a priority for the Calgary Stampede as the city grew into a major financial and oil hub in Western Canada.<ref name="Dixon44" /> "Aggie Days", a program designed to introduce urban schoolchildren to agriculture  was introduced in 1989 and proved immediately popular.<ref name="Dixon44" /> A ten-year expansion plan called Horizon 2000 was released in 1990 detailing plans to grow Stampede Park into a year-round destination for Calgarians;<ref name="GuysDream" /> an updated plan was released in 2004.<ref name="Dixon45">{{harvnb|Dixon|Read|2005|p=45}}</ref> Attendance has plateaued around 1.2 million since 2000, with the current record of 1,262,518 set in 2006.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/calgary/story/2009/07/13/calgary-stampede-attendance.html |title=Calgary Stampede attendance falls slightly |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |date=2009-07-13 |accessdate=2010-05-19}}</ref>  The organization dropped the word "exhibition" from its title in 2007, and has since been known simply as the Calgary Stampede.<ref>{{harvnb|Foran|2008|p=ix}}</ref>

===Parade===
[[File:Barrel-Racing-Szmurlo.jpg|200px|thumb|A cowgirl races around a barrel.|alt=A woman on horseback makes a sharp turn around a white barrel.]]

Weadick is credited with inventing the sport of [[chuckwagon racing]] in 1923, inspired either by seeing a similar event in 1922 at the [[Gleichen, Alberta|Gleichen Stampede]] or watching impromptu races as he grew up.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.wpca.com/history.aspx |title=History |publisher=Western Professional Chuckwagon Association |accessdate=2011-01-09}}</ref>  He devised the sport to be a new and exciting event for the newly joined Exhibition and Stampede.<ref name="CH1960Chucks">{{citation |last=Primrose |first=Tom |work=Calgary Herald Magazine |date=1960-07-09 |page=1}}</ref> Weadick invited ranchers to enter their wagons and crews to compete for a total of $275 in prize money.<ref name="CS history">{{citation |url=http://cs.calgarystampede.com/events/chuckwagon-races/history.html |title=Chuckwagon races <U+2013> History |publisher=Calgary Stampede |accessdate=2010-05-21}}</ref>

The chuckwagon drivers auction advertising space on their wagons before each year's Stampede.

When the agricultural exhibition was first launched in 1886, Alberta was an overwhelmingly rural province. Today, agricultural producers make up less than two percent of the province's population, but the exhibition remains an integral part of the Calgary Stampede.<ref>{{harvnb|Dixon|Read|2005|p=106}}</ref>  Nearly half of all visitors attend the exhibition, which is made up of 50 agricultural programs organized by more than 1,000 exhibitors.<ref name="Dixon107">{{harvnb|Dixon|Read|2005|p=107}}</ref> Numerous competitions are held as part of the exhibition.

The Calgary Stampede [[carnival|midway]] has been operated by North American Midway Entertainment, and its predecessor [[Conklin Shows]], since 1976.<ref>{{harvnb|Foran|2008|pp=118<U+2013>119}}</ref> The midway is the only part of the event operated on a for-profit basis.<ref name="Foran113">{{harvnb|Foran|2008|p=113}}</ref> It is considered an essential component of the Stampede, but is separate from the predominantly western theme.<ref>{{harvnb|Foran|2008|pp=112<U+2013>113}}</ref> The midway opens on the Thursday night before other events begin, known as "sneak-a-peek" night.<ref>{{citation |url=http://cs.calgarystampede.com/blog/2009/07/02/highlights-for-thursday-july-2-2009/ |title=Highlights for Thursday, July 2, 2009 |publisher=Calgary Stampede |date=2009-07-03 |accessdate=2010-05-25}}</ref>  In addition to the traditional rides and carnival games, the midway features two concert areas: the [[Coca-Cola]] Stage and Nashville North, which feature rock/pop and country music respectively, and draw acts from all over North America.<ref>{{Citation |url=http://cs.calgarystampede.com/music/coca-cola-stage.html |title=Coca-Cola stage |publisher=Calgary Stampede |accessdate=2010-05-25}}</ref><ref>{{Citation |url=http://cs.calgarystampede.com/music/nashville-north.html |title=Nashville North |publisher=Calgary Stampede |accessdate=2010-05-25}}</ref>

===Market===
The Stampede Market is located in the [[Bank of Montreal|BMO]] Centre on the northwest corner of the park.<ref name="StampedePark" />  It offers {{convert|38000|m2|sqft}} of retail space and in 2011 had 181 vendors selling artwork, toys, household goods, foodstuffs and other items.<ref name="CHMarket">{{citation |last=Penty |first=Rebecca |url=http://www.calgaryherald.com/sports/Vendors+hope+cash+Stampede+visitors/5081156/story.html |title=Vendors hope to cash in on Stampede visitors |work=Calgary Herald |date=2011-07-11 |page=B1}}</ref>  The Western Oasis, a subsection of the market, offers cowboy and western-themed artwork, bronze statues, craftwork, foods and wine.<ref name="StampedePark" />  Lured by the opportunity to show their wares to the one million people who attend the Stampede, some vendors wait years before gaining admittance, and those that do consider it one of the prime events of the year.<ref name="CHMarket" />

==Stampede Park==

A large arena is situated to the left, behind a building with a green peaked roof.  To the right in the distance is a dirt race track.]]
Stampede Park is located southeast of downtown Calgary in the [[Beltline, Calgary|Beltline District]] and is serviced by [[Calgary Transit]]'s [[C-Train|light rail system]]. Permanent structures at the site include the Saddledome and Corral, Big Four Building, BMO Centre <U+2013> a convention and exhibition facility <U+2013> a casino, the [[Stampede Grandstand]], the agriculture building, and a number of facilities that support the exhibition and livestock shows.<ref name="StampedePark">{{citation |title=Stampede Park |work=Calgary Sun |date=2011-07-08 |pages=2<U+2013>3}}</ref>

The park remains at its original location, though attempts were made to relocate.  In 1964, the Stampede Board made plans to purchase former military land in southwest Calgary near [[Alberta Highway 8|Glenmore Trail]] and 24 Street and relocate the park there.  A fully developed plan was released in 1965, and while it had the support of the civic and federal governments, intense opposition from nearby residents quashed the proposal.<ref name="Gray152">{{harvnb|Gray|1985|p=152}}</ref>  Space concerns remained a constant issue, and a new plan to push northward into the Victoria Park community beginning in 1968 initiated a series of conflicts with the neighbourhood and city council that persisted for decades.<ref name="Gray158">{{harvnb|Gray|1985|p=158}}</ref>

While Victoria Park fell into steady decline, it was not until 2007 that the final buildings were removed, paving the way for both an expansion of Stampede Park and an urban renewal program for the area.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.canada.com/calgaryherald/news/archives/story.html?id=ed77fced-1555-4793-b89b-a7aa1154a53e |title='We've erased Victoria Park' |work=Calgary Herald |date=2007-05-15 |accessdate=2011-01-09}}</ref> With the land finally secured, the Stampede organization<!--does the entity have a name other than the event name?--> embarked on a $400-million expansion that is planned to feature a new retail and entertainment district, an urban park, a new agricultural arena and potentially a new hotel.  The expansion was originally planned to be complete by 2011, but delays and an [[Late-2000s recession|economic downturn]] have pushed the expected completion of the project back to 2014.<ref>{{citation |last=Toneguzzi |first=Mario |title=Calgary Stampede Park moves ahead with $400-million expansion |work=Calgary Herald |date=2010-11-09 |page=D3}}</ref> 

Stampede Park has long been a central gathering place for Calgarians and tourists. In addition to attendance at the Calgary Stampede, over 2.5 million people attend other sporting events, concerts, trade shows and meetings on a grounds that hosts over 1,000 events annually.<ref>{{harvnb|Dixon|Read|2005|p=115}}</ref>

===Native participation===
At each Stampede, the five nations of the [[Treaty 7]] <U+2013> the [[Tsuu T'ina Nation|Tsuu T'ina]], [[Northern Peigan|Piikani]], [[Nakoda (Stoney)|Stoney]], [[Kainai Nation|Kainai]] and [[Siksika Nation|Siksika]] <U+2013> create an "Indian Village" on the bank of the [[Elbow River]] in the southern section of Stampede Park.  They erect [[tipi]]s, organize [[pow wow]]s, offer arts and crafts, and re-enact elements of their traditional lifestyle.<ref name="CSIndianvillage">{{citation |url=http://www.indianvillage.ca/Default.aspx?cid=5&lang=1 |title=About Indian Village |publisher=Calgary Stampede |accessdate=2011-06-18}}</ref>  Each year, an Indian Princess is selected from one of the five nations to represent the Treaty 7 as part of the Stampede's royalty.<ref>{{citation |url=http://calgary.ctv.ca/servlet/an/local/CTVNews/20101003/CGY_stampede_court_101003/20101003/?hub=CalgaryHome |title=Stampede Queen and Princesses chosen |publisher=CTV News |date=2010-10-03 |accessdate=2011-06-18}}</ref>  The village is among the Stampede's most popular attractions.<ref name="CHIndianVillageMoving">{{citation |last=Toneguzzi |first=Mario |url=http://www.calgaryherald.com/sports/Indian+Village+headed+bigger+home/5097883/story.html |title=Indian Village headed for bigger home |work=Calgary Herald |date=2011-07-13 |accessdate=2011-07-16}}</ref>

[[First Nations]] peoples had been frequent participants in the city's exhibitions since they were first held in 1886, taking part in parades and sporting events and entertaining spectators with traditional dances. By 1912 however, pressure from agents of the [[Indian and Northern Affairs Canada|Department of Indian Affairs]] to suppress their historic traditions and to keep them on their farms nearly ended native participation.<ref>{{harvnb|Foran|2008|pp=48<U+2013>52}}</ref>  Weadick hoped to include native people as a feature of his Stampede, but Indian Affairs opposed his efforts and asked the [[Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn|Duke of Connaught]], Canada's [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]], to support their position.  The Duke refused, and after Weadick gained the support of political contacts in Ottawa, including future [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[R. B. Bennett]], the path was cleared.<ref name="Foran55">{{harvnb|Foran|2008|pp=54<U+2013>55}}</ref>

[[File:Indian Village.png|thumb|left|[[Tipi]]s at Indian Village|alt=A row of several conical canvas dwellings, each decorated in traditional native themes, including animals and bright colours.]]
Hundreds of First Nations peoples, representing six tribes, participated at the 1912 Stampede.  They camped in tipis and wore their finest traditional regalia, making them among the most popular participants in the parade.<ref name="Foran55" /> Tom Three Persons, of the Blood (Kainai) tribe, emerged as one of the Stampede's first heroes, amazing spectators with a winning performance in the saddle bronc competition.<ref name="GuysDream" />  He was the only Canadian champion of the first Stampede and became the first person to successfully ride Cyclone, a notorious horse that had thrown over 100 riders during its career.<ref>{{harvnb|Foran|2008|p=305}}</ref>

The federal government attempted to prevent a repeat occurrence, modifying the [[Indian Act]] in 1914 to make it illegal for natives to participate in fairs or parades without permission from the local [[Indian Agent (Canada)|Indian Agent]].<ref>{{harvnb|Foran|2008|p=56}}</ref>  The new law ended native participation in the Calgary Exhibition, but when Weadick returned in 1919, he successfully fought for their return to the fairgrounds.<ref>{{harvnb|Foran|2008|p=57}}</ref> Indian Affairs again sought to ban native participation in 1925 without success.<ref name="Gray80">{{harvnb|Gray|1985|p=80}}</ref> While conflicts between the Stampede and Indian Affairs continued until 1932, the Indian Village has remained a staple on the grounds.<ref>{{harvnb|Foran|2008|p=60}}</ref>

First Nations members and the Stampede board have occasionally met with conflict. The original location of the Indian Village was on low-lying ground that frequently flooded, a problem that was not resolved until 1974 when the village was moved its current location.<ref name="Foran65">{{harvnb|Foran|2008|p=65}}</ref> Complaints about low appearance fees paid to tipi owners, lack of input on committees related to their participation and accusations that natives were being exploited have periodically been made throughout the years.<ref>{{harvnb|Foran|2008|pp=65<U+2013>67}}</ref>  The Stoneys famously boycotted the 1950 Stampede following a rule change that cancelled a policy giving any native person free admittance upon showing their treaty card. The event that year was marred by violent thunderstorms, which led to apocryphal stories that the band had performed a rain dance in an effort to ruin the fair.<ref name="Foran65" />

Despite the conflicts, the native communities around Calgary have been enthusiastic supporters of the Stampede and the Indian Village.<ref>{{harvnb|Foran|2008|p=67}}</ref>  The tipi owners have been long-term participants <U+2013> many are third or fourth generation <U+2013> and the Stampede has helped preserve and display native culture to the public.<ref>{{harvnb|Foran|2008|p=68}}</ref> The village will again relocate in 2013. It will double in size and feature a new exhibit displaying the partnership between the city, local nations and the Stampede.<ref name="CHIndianVillageMoving" />

===Employment and volunteerism===
[[File:Calgarystampede.jpg|thumb|right|The Stampede Showband performs on stage|alt=Approximately 50 people in red, black and white uniforms stand on a stage as a team of riders on horseback carry Canadian Flags in the background.]]
Operation of the park throughout the year requires 300 full-time and 1,400 part-time employees.  An additional 3,500 seasonal workers are hired for the Stampede itself.<ref name="Dixon127" />  The seasonal positions are often filled by Calgary's youth, and for many, represents their first paying jobs.<ref>{{harvnb|Dixon|Read|2005|p=128}}</ref>  
The organization is maintained by a legion of volunteers, however.<ref>{{harvnb|Gray|1985|p=184}}</ref> Over 2,000 volunteers sit on one of 50 committees responsible for all aspects of the Stampede's operation.<ref>{{citation |title=2009 Annual Report to the Community |publisher=Calgary Stampede |page=11}}</ref>  Chief among them are the board of directors. The board is made up of 25 individuals; 20 elected from amongst the shareholders, three representing the city, one the province and the most recent president of the Stampede board.<ref>{{citation |last=Gray |first-Mitchell |title=A few minutes with the boss |work=Calgary Herald |date=2002-07-04 |page=SE9}}</ref>  Nearly half of all volunteers have served for more than 10 years, and some as long as 60.<ref>{{harvnb|Dixon|Read|2005|p=123}}</ref>

===Young Canadians and the Stampede Showband===
When the Calgary Stampede brought in [[The Rockettes]] from New York as part of the 1964 grandstand show, they auditioned local youth to participate as the "Calgary Kidettes".  It was intended to be a one-time addition, but proved immensely popular with spectators,<ref name="Dixon116">{{harvnb|Dixon|Read|2005|p=116}}</ref> and both The Rockettes and Kidettes returned in the following years.<ref>{{citation |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=f2NkAAAAIBAJ&sjid=h3wNAAAAIBAJ&pg=828,3156127 |title=More top talent signed for big grandstand show |work=Calgary Herald |date=1966-05-10 |accessdate=2011-04-17 |page=45}}</ref> The Kidettes were renamed the Young Canadians in 1968 and not only remained a staple of the grandstand show, but grew into a headlining act by the late 1970s.<ref name="Dixon116" />  Within nine years of their creation, the Young Canadians were playing shows throughout Canada and the northern United States and performing in front of over 200,000 people every year.<ref>{{citation |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=725kAAAAIBAJ&sjid=cX0NAAAAIBAJ&pg=3669,451041 |title=Young Canadians taking tunes to many exhibitions |work=Calgary Herald |date=1973-07-03 |accessdate=2011-04-17 |page=16A}}</ref>  In 1982, the Stampede set up the Young Canadians School of Performing Arts. Supported by both the Calgary public and Catholic school boards, the school offers professional training to singers and dancers between the ages of 7 and 19 paid for by scholarships from the Stampede organization.<ref>{{harvnb|Dixon|Read|2005|p=117}}</ref>

The Stampede Showband was created in 1971 to serve as the organization's musical ambassadors.

==Community==
The festival spirit during Stampede extends throughout the city.  Parade day serves as an unofficial holiday as many companies give employees half or full days off to attend.<ref>{{harvnb|Reasons|1984|p=103}}</ref>  People of all walks of life, from executives to students, discard formal attire for casual western dress, typically represented by [[Wrangler (jeans)|Wrangler jeans]] and [[cowboy hat]]s.<ref>{{citation |last=Williamson |first=Kerry |title=Hats, boots, jeans <U+2014> now you're ready! |work=Calgary Herald |date=2002-07-04 |page=SE10}}</ref> Many Calgarians have reduced productivity during the event because they take a relaxed attitude towards their usual workplace and personal responsibilities.<ref>{{harvnb|Reasons|1984|p=104}}</ref>

===Pancake breakfasts===
[[File:Chinook Stampede Breakfast.png|thumb|right|250px|The Chinook Centre pancake breakfast serves over 60,000 people each year.|alt=Several thousand people stand in lineups while volunteers serve food.  A large shopping mall stands in the background.]]

The largest is the breakfast hosted at the [[Chinook Centre]] shopping mall.  Four hundred volunteers are required to feed over 60,000 people who attend the one-day event that had its 50th anniversary in 2010.<ref name="ChinookPancake" /> Other groups, such as the Calgary Stampede Caravan, feed as many as 120,000 people over ten days.<ref>{{citation |last=Dormer |first=Dave |url=http://test.calgarysun.com/news/Stampede/2010/07/09/14659826.html |title=120,000 expected at Stampede breakfasts |work=Calgary Sun |date=2010-07-09 |accessdate=2011-08-01}}</ref>  The rising popularity of the [[barbecue grill]] in the 1960s and the city's population boom at the time brought with it the growth of community and company barbecues throughout the city during Stampede.<ref name="Gray137" />  Community booster groups have exported the tradition across the country as a symbol of Calgary's hospitality.  Among them are the Calgary [[Grey Cup]] Committee, whose volunteers have hosted pancake breakfasts on the day of the [[Canadian Football League]] championship game for over three decades, sometimes in spite of poor weather conditions for the November game.<ref>{{citation |last=Bielski |first=Zosia |url=http://www.canada.com/nationalpost/news/story.html?id=769f6b8d-2ed6-4b17-a67f-f33ef3df54c4 |title=The breakfast must go on |work=National Post |date=2007-11-23 |accessdate=2011-07-11}}</ref>

===Stampede parties===
The size and number of parties each year during Stampede is viewed as an indicator of Calgary's economic strength.<ref name="CHParties">{{citation |last=Toneguzzi |first=Mario |title=Economy spurs higher interest in Stampede corporate parties |work=Calgary Herald |date=2011-07-08 |page=B3}}</ref>  Corporations and community groups hold lavish events throughout the city for their staff and clients,<ref name="CHParties" /> while bars and pubs erect party tents, the largest of which draws up to 20,000 people per day.<ref>{{citation|url=http://calgary.ctv.ca/servlet/an/local/CTVNews/20110705/CGY_party_tents_110705/20110705/?hub=CalgaryHome |title=Party tents popping up |publisher=CTV News |Date=2011-07-05 |accessdate=2011-07-12}}</ref>  Paul Vickers, who owns several establishments in the city, estimates that he makes up to 20 percent of his annual revenue during the ten days of Stampede alone.<ref>{{citation |last=Pitts |first=Gordon |url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/energized-by-oils-resurgence-calgary-gets-ready-to-cash-in/article2087977/ |title=Energized by oil<U+2019>s resurgence, Calgary gets ready to cash in |work=The Globe and Mail |date=2011-07-06 |accessdate=2011-07-12}}</ref>  Some parties have become known for heavy drinking and relaxed morals,<ref name="CBCBuckles">{{citation |last=Rutherford |first=Kristina |url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/calgarystampede/blog/2010/07/buckle-bunnies-whiskey-and-stampede-rumours.html |title=Buckle bunnies, whiskey and Stampede rumours |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |date=2010-07-18 |accessdate=2011-07-12}}</ref> so much so that one hotel's satirical ad promising to safely store a patron's wedding ring during Stampede was widely viewed as a legitimate offer.<ref name="WFPDebauchery">{{citation |last=Graveland |first=Bill |last2=Montgomery |first2=Shannon |url=http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/canada/calgary-stampede-debauchery-divorce-disease-50532497.html?path=/canada&id=50532497 |title=Calgary Stampede: Debauchery... divorce, disease |work=Winnipeg Free Press |date=2008-07-11 |accessdate=2011-07-12}}</ref>  The parties are not without consequences, as lawyers have noted a significant increase in divorce filings in the weeks following the Stampede, primarily on claims of infidelity.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.upi.com/Odd_News/2009/07/03/Divorce-rate-rises-after-Calgary-Stampede/UPI-26711246645077/ |title=Divorce rate rises after Calgary Stampede |publisher=United Press International |Date=2009-07-03 |accessdate=2011-07-12}}</ref>  Clinics see an increase in people seeking testing and treatment for [[sexually transmitted disease]]s,<ref name="WFPDebauchery" /> and Calgary is said to experience an annual baby boom each April <U+2013> nine months after the event.<ref name="CBCBuckles" />

==Relationship with the city==

The Stampede has become inexorably linked to the city's identity.  Calgary has long been called the "Stampede City",<ref>{{citation |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=RC9kAAAAIBAJ&sjid=9HsNAAAAIBAJ&pg=7044,730836 |title=Calgary now is recognized as 'Stampede city' |work=Calgary Herald |date=1953-07-04 |accessdate=2011-04-16 |page=19}}</ref> and carries the informal nickname of "Cowtown".<ref>{{harvnb|Foran|2008|p=166}}</ref>  The event's iconic status offers Calgary global publicity and plays a significant role in defining the city's image.<ref>{{harvnb|Foran|2008|p=148}}</ref>  Calgary's [[Canadian Football League]] team has been called the [[Calgary Stampeders|Stampeders]] since 1945, and it is a name shared by other teams in various sports throughout the city's history, including the [[Calgary Stampeders (ice hockey)|Stampeders hockey team]] that operated in the years following World War II.<ref name="Gray142" />

The Stampede has strong polling support within the province.  A 2006 [[Ipsos-Reid]] poll found that 86 percent of Albertans felt that it raised the civic quality of life and considered it one of the region's most important cultural events.  Nearly three in four stated they look forward to the annual event.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.ipsos-na.com/news-polls/pressrelease.aspx?id=3121 |title=Calgary Stampede Still The Greatest Outdoor Show On Earth For Albertans |publisher=Ipsos-Reid |date=2006-06-23 |accessdate=2011-06-04}}</ref> However, critics argue that the themes promoted by the Stampede and within the city are an [[Tradition#Invention of tradition|invented tradition]]. They suggest that it is not a reflection of Alberta's frontier history, but represents a mythical impression of western cowboy culture created by 19th-century wild west shows and exploited for profit.<ref>{{harvnb|Foran|2008|p=x}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Foran|2008|p=22}}</ref> 

Part of the event's success can be attributed to the close relationship the Stampede has often shared with both the civic government and community leaders.  Mayors of Calgary and city aldermen have sat on the Stampede Board of Governors at the same time they occupied public office, and the Stampede's ability to convince the city's wealthy and influential citizens to volunteer their time has allowed the organization to gain a high profile within the city.<ref>{{harvnb|Foran|2008|p=151}}</ref>  The Stampede operates on city-owned land, pays no property tax on its lease, and typically faces little to no political interference from City Hall.<ref>{{harvnb|Foran|2008|p=150}}</ref>  It operates as a non-profit entity with all income reinvested into the park.  All improvements to the park would revert to city control if the lease were allowed to expire.<ref name="Reasons109">{{harvnb|Reasons|1984|p=109}}</ref>

Likewise, the Stampede has support from the media,<ref>{{harvnb|Foran|2008|p=153}}</ref> which has been accused of providing an inordinate amount of positive coverage to the event while trivializing negative aspects.<ref>{{harvnb|Reasons|1984|p=97}}</ref>  The local media faced national scrutiny in 2009 when both major newspapers refused to run anti-rodeo ads sponsored by the Vancouver Humane Society.<ref name="DividedHumane" />  While the ''[[Calgary Herald]]'' simply refused to run the ad, the ''[[Calgary Sun]]'' defended its position in an editorial.  The ''Sun'' refuted charges it was kowtowing to the Stampede and justified its refusal by claiming "we are Calgarians and allowing a group of outsiders to come in and insult a proud Calgary tradition seemed just plain wrong."<ref>{{citation |last=Norrie |first=Gordon |url=http://www.calgarysun.com/comment/editorial/2009/06/30/9977571-sun.html |title=No sacred cows in our line of work |work=Calgary Sun |date=2009-06-30 |accessdate=2011-04-16}}</ref>  The ''Herald'' reversed its decision a year later, running a full-page ad sponsored by the Vancouver Humane Society.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/story/2010/07/05/calgary-calf-roping-ad-herald-humane-society-vancouver.html |title=Anti-rodeo ad runs in Calgary paper |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |date=2010-07-05 |accessdate=2011-04-16}}</ref>

Stampede officials estimated in 2009 that the city of Calgary had a gross economic impact of $172.4 million from the ten-day event alone, with a wider provincial total of $226.7 million.<ref name="CSTourism">{{citation |url=http://communities.canada.com/calgaryherald/blogs/stampede/archive/2009/07/04/stampede-an-event-of-numbers.aspx |title=Stampede an event of numbers |work=Calgary Herald |date=2009-07-04 |accessdate=2011-06-04}}</ref>  In terms of economic impact, the Stampede is the highest grossing festival in Canada, ahead of Ottawa's [[Winterlude]], the [[Canadian National Exhibition]] in Toronto, and the [[Just for Laughs]] festival in Montreal.<ref>{{citation |last=Backland |first=Jason |url=http://money.ca.msn.com/savings-debt/gallery/gallery.aspx?cp-documentid=24740236 |title=Biggest festivals in Canada |publisher=MSN Canada |date=2010-07-04 |accessdate=2011-06-04}}</ref>  Additionally, Stampede officials estimate that for every dollar spent at Stampede Park, tourists spend $2.65 in the rest of the city.<ref name="CSTourism" /> A poll conducted in 2011 found that 40 percent of Calgarians who intended to attend the Stampede expected to spend $150<U+2013>$400 over the course of the event, and 7 percent stated that they would spend more than that.<ref>{{citation |last=Toneguzzi |first=Mario |title=Calgarians big Stampede spenders |work=Calgary Herald |date=2011-07-08 |page=D3}}</ref>

===Promoting Calgary===
Civic leaders have consistently made note of the Stampede's impact on the city. Mayor [[Andrew Davison]] claimed in 1944 that the event "had done more to advertise Calgary than any single agency," an opinion that has been echoed by his successors.<ref>{{harvnb|Foran|2008|p=152}}</ref>  Stampede officials have made similar claims, arguing that the event is one of Canada's most important tourist attractions.<ref>{{harvnb|Foran|2008|p=328}}</ref>  The Canadian Tourism Commission placed the event in its Signature Experiences Collection, one of six such events or locations in Alberta.<ref>{{citation |last=Guttormson |first=Kim |url=http://www.calgaryherald.com/travel/Calgary+Stampede+branded+tourism+series/5089791/story.html |title=Calgary Stampede branded in tourism series |work=Calgary Herald |date=2011-07-12 |accessdate=2011-07-12 |page=D1}}</ref>

According to [[Ralph Klein]], former mayor of Calgary and premier of Alberta, the Stampede symbolizes the province's spirit. He cited the friendly and welcoming attitude and festival spirit of the city's populace during the event, which community booster groups export around the world.<ref>{{citation |last=Klein |first=Ralph |title=The Stampede adds colour to our towering offices |work=Calgary Herald |date=2005-06-12 |page=A16}}</ref>  Among examples cited was the infamous [[36th Grey Cup|1948 Grey Cup]] game in which two trains of Stampeder football fans descended on Toronto and launched an unprecedented series of celebrations before, during and after the game that included riding a horse into the lobby of the [[Fairmont Royal York|Royal York Hotel]].<ref>{{citation |last=Christie |first=Alan |url=http://greycup.cfl.ca/article/the-story-of-the-1948-grey-cup_43629 |title=The story of the 1948 grey Cup |publisher=Canadian Football League |date=2008-10-26 |accessdate=2011-07-23}}</ref>  The events helped turn the Grey Cup into a national festival and the largest single-day sporting event in the country.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.albertasportshalloffame.com/component/zoo/item/1948-calgary-stampeders-football |title=1948 Calgary Stampeders, football team |publisher=Alberta Sports Hall of Fame |accessdate=2011-07-23}}</ref><ref>{{citation |last=Toth |first=Dan |url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Football/CFL/Calgary/2005/05/18/pf-1045006.html |title=History for sale |work=Calgary Sun |Date=2005-05-18 |accessdate=2011-07-23}}</ref>
