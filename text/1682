'''''Spindizzy''''' is an [[isometric projection|isometric]] [[Personal computer game|computer game]] released for several [[8-bit]] formats in 1986 by [[Electric Dreams Software]]. It features [[Action game|action]] and [[Puzzle video game|puzzle game]] elements. Players must navigate a series of screens to explore a landscape suspended in a dimensional space. Development was headed by Paul Shirley, who drew inspiration from [[Rare (company)|Rareware]] games that feature an isometric projection.

The game was successful in the [[United Kingdom]] and was well-received by the video game press. Reviewers praised its visuals and design, but criticized its audio. Similarities were drawn to ''[[Marble Madness]]'', which was released in arcades two years earlier. ''Spindizzy'' was followed by a 1990s sequel titled ''[[Spindizzy Worlds]]''.

''Spindizzy'' is an [[Action game|action]] and [[Puzzle video game|puzzle game]] [[Video games with isometric graphics|played from an isometric perspective]]. Players can view the playing field from four different angles, and rotate between them. The game takes place in a fictional landscape of interconnected stages suspended in a dimensional space. The player controls a probe called a Gyroscopic Environmental Reconnaissance And Land-Mapping Device (GERALD), via keyboard commands or a joystick. The craft is able to transform<U+2014>and modify its mobility as a result<U+2014>between three configurations: a ball, an inverted [[square pyramid]], and a [[gyroscope]]. Players navigate the probe through the stages to explore the world within a time limit. The time limit can be extended by collecting power jewels scattered through the world and is decreased by falling off a stage. Stages feature ramps, corridors, and other obstacles that hinder the player from quickly traversing them. The game ends when time expires or the world is completely explored.<ref name="ZZAP-14">{{cite journal| journal = [[Zzap!64]]| title = ''Spindizzy''| publisher = [[Newsfield Publications]]| date = June 1986| issue = 14| pages = 108<U+2013>109}}</ref><ref name="Crash-29">{{cite journal| journal = [[Crash (magazine)|Crash]]| publisher = [[Newsfield Publications]]| title = ''Spindizzy''| issue = 29| date = June 1986| pages = 16<U+2013>17}}</ref>

== Development and release ==

''Spindizzy'' was developed by Paul Shirley of British video game developer [[Electric Dreams Software]]. He was primarily inspired by [[Rare (company)|Rareware]] games that feature an [[isometric projection]], but was also influenced by the gameplay of the 1984 arcade game ''[[Marble Madness]]''. Shirley created an [[Interpreter (computing)|interpreted]] script to generate the game's levels. The script allowed him to design a large number of stages using 11[[Kilobyte|KB]] of storage. The game was originally released for the [[Commodore 64]] and [[Amstrad CPC]]. It was later [[porting|ported]] to [[Atari 8-bit]], [[ZX Spectrum]], and [[Apple II series|Apple II]] computers.<ref name="Halcyon">{{cite book| title = [[Halcyon Days (book)|Halcyon Days]]: Interviews with Classic Computer and Video Games Programmers| editor = James Hague| year = 1997| chapter = Paul Shirley| publisher = Dadgum Games| chapterurl = http://www.dadgum.com/halcyon/BOOK/SHIRLEY.HTM}}</ref> ''Spindizzy'' cartridges were promoted as prizes in magazine contests upon its release.<ref>{{cite journal| journal = [[Computer and Video Games]]| publisher = [[EMAP]]| title = ''Spindizzy'' Competition| date = July 1986| issue = 57| page = 72|}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal| journal = [[Your Sinclair]]| publisher = [[Dennis Publishing]]| title = A Really Rather Big Competition| date = August 1986| issue = 8| pages = 38<U+2013>39}}</ref> American video game company [[Activision]] published the game in the United States as part of its "Electric Dreams" series.<ref name="Compute-77">{{cite journal| journal = [[COMPUTE!]]| publisher = Small System Services| title = A Great Year For Games| issue = 77| date = October 1986| page = 18| first = Selby| last = Bateman}}</ref> John Sanderson programmed the Apple II version; Shirley was unaware of the port's existence until the mid-1990s.<ref name="Halcyon"/><ref name="Moby">{{cite web| url = http://www.mobygames.com/game/spindizzy| title = ''Spindizzy'' <U+2013> MobyGames| publisher = [[MobyGames]]| accessdate = 2010-01-18}}</ref> ''Spindizzy'' was later re-released as part of an Activision compilation.<ref>{{cite journal| journal = [[Your Sinclair]]| publisher = [[Dennis Publishing]]| title = ''Spindizzy''| date = April 1991| issue = 64| page = 8}}</ref> The company sold ''Spindizzy''{{'}}s compilation rights not long after obtaining them, which reduced the amount of royalties to Shirley and Electric Dreams.
