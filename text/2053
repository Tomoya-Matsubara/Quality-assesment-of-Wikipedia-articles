'''Miguel As<U+00ED>n Palacios''' (1871-1944) was a [[Spain|Spanish]] scholar (an [[Arabist]]), and a [[Roman Catholic]] [[priest]]. He is primarily known for suggesting [[Islam]]ic sources for ideas and motifs present in [[Dante]]'s [[Divine Comedy]], which he discusses in his book ''La Escatolog<U+00ED>a musulmana en la Divina Comedia'' [Muslim Eschatology in the Divine Comedy] (1919). He wrote extensively on [[Al-Ghazali]] [Algazel].  His major book ''El Islam Cristianizado'' (1931) presents a study of [[Sufism]] through the works of [[Ibn Arabi|Muhyiddin ibn 'Arabi]] [Mohidin Abenarabe] of [[Murcia]].

==Life==
Miguel As<U+00ED>n Palacios was born in [[Zaragoza]], [[Arag<U+00F3>n]], on [[July 5]], [[1871]], into the modest commercial family of Don Pablo As<U+00ED>n and Do<U+00F1>a Filomena Palacios.  His older brother Luis, his younger sister Dolores, and he were little children when their father died of pneumonia.  His mother the young widow continued in business with help and made ends meet with decorum but not as well as before.  He attended the Colegio de El Salvador instructed by [[Jesuits]] in Zaragoza, all the while making life long friendships. He entered the Seminario Conciliar, singing his first [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] at San Cayetano in Zaragoza in 1895.<ref>Emilio Garc<U+00ED>a G<U+00F3>mez, "Don Miguel As<U+00ED>n (1871-1944) Esquema de una biograf<U+00ED>a" in ''Al-Andalus'' 9: 266-291, 269 (1944).</ref>  

At the [[University of Zaragoza|Universidad de Zaragoza]] As<U+00ED>n had met and begun study under the Arabist Professor [[Julian Ribera y Tarrago|Juli<U+00E1>n Ribera y Tarrag<U+00F3>]].<ref>As<U+00ED>n would later write the long introduction to the ''jubilaci<U+00F3>n'' for Prof. Ribera, ''Disertaciones y Op<U+00FA>sculos'' (Madrid: Imprenta de Estanislao Maestre 1928), 2 volumes, at I: xv-cxvi.</ref>  In 1896 at Madrid he defended his thesis on the [[Persia]]n theologian [[al-Ghazali|Algazel]] (1058-1111) before [[:es:Francisco Codera Zaid<U+00ED>n|Francisco Codera Zaid<U+00ED>n]] and [[Marcelino Men<U+00E9>ndez y Pelayo]].<ref>Emilio Garc<U+00ED>a G<U+00F3>mez, "Homenaje a Don Francisco Codera: 1836-1917" in ''Al Andalus'' at 15: 263-274 (1950).</ref> All three professors guided his subsequent studies. As<U+00ED>n then developed his study of Al-Ghazali, and published it in 1901. Next he wrote on [[Ibn 'Arabi|Mohidin Abenarabe]]. Thus As<U+00ED>n was running parallel with a then European-wide effort to understand Muslim inner spirituality.<ref>Jos<U+00E9> Valdivia V<U+00E1>lor, ''Don Miguel As<U+00ED>n Palacios. M<U+00ED>stica cristiana y m<U+00ED>stica musulmana'' (Madrid: Ediciones Hiperi<U+00F3>n 1992) at 19-25, 66.</ref><ref>James T. Monroe, ''Islam and the Arabs in Spanish Scholarship'' (Leiden: Brill 1970) at 176.</ref> 

Professor Codera then retired from his chair in the Arabic Language at the [[University of Madrid|Universidad de Madrid]] to make room for As<U+00ED>n; Ribera allowed As<U+00ED>n to assume this ''c<U+00E1>tedra'' in 1903. Professor As<U+00ED>n lived in the same boarding house<ref>This boarding house was well known for its residents and visitors, past (e.g., Sanz del Rio) and current. The ''tertulia'' (discussion group) of [[Marcelino Men<U+00E9>ndez y Pelayo|Men<U+00E9>ndez y Pelayo]] met there, as did a variety of politicians and their supporters, and the young Duque de Alba (hence As<U+00ED>n's ''entr<U+00E9>e'' to royalty). Emilio Garc<U+00ED>a G<U+00F3>mez, "Don Miguel As<U+00ED>n" in ''Al-Andalus'' 9:266-291 at 274-275 (1944).</ref> as Codera, and was well received in the university. By 1905 Professor Ribera had also come to Madrid and with As<U+00ED>n founded the journal ''Cultura Espa<U+00F1>ola'' (1906-1909). As<U+00ED>n attended international conferences in Algeria (1905) and Copenhagen (1908), where he engaged other [[Arabists]] and academics in [[Islamic studies]]. In Madrid he continued to prosper, eventually being admitted to the royal court where he gained the friendship of [[Alfonso XIII]].<ref>Monroe, ''Islam and the Arabs in Spanish Scholarship'' at 175-178, 129.</ref><ref>Valdivia V<U+00E1>lor, ''Don Miguel As<U+00ED>n Palacios'' at 25-27, 68.</ref>

As<U+00ED>n, of course, is known for his academic work concerning the medieval Christian-Muslim interface of theology, mysticism, and religious practice, with particular attention to medieval Spain. Among the figures studied were [[Al-Ghazali]], [[Ibn 'Arabi]], [[Averro<U+00EB>s]] (Ibn Rushd), [[Ibn Masarra]], [[Ibn Hazm]], as well as the rabbi [[Maimonides]] (all from [[Al-Andalus]] except al-Ghazali), and comparative work on [[Ramon Lull]], [[Thomas Aquinas]], [[Dante Alighieri]], [[Teresa of Avila]], [[John of the Cross]], and [[Blaise Pascal]].

As<U+00ED>n's manner of approach was to stick to a theme, to keep circling over it, each time adding to the understanding. His method of work involved meticulous planning, conceiving the order of presentation in detail, then straight ahead, without a rough draft ("sin borrador"), redacted with each reference note on its proper page.<ref>Emilio Garc<U+00ED>a G<U+00F3>mez, "Don Miguel As<U+00ED>n" in ''Al-Andalus'' 9:266-291 at 284, 287 (1944).</ref>

In 1932 the journal ''Al-Andalus'' began publication under the direction of As<U+00ED>n Palacios; it was technically equipped to satisfy a readership of academic specialists. As<U+00ED>n himself was a frequent contributor. In the universities, a new generation of Spanish Arabists was emerging, such as [[Emilio Garc<U+00ED>a G<U+00F3>mez]], influenced by As<U+00ED>n.<ref>See, e.g., the ''Continuations'' section below.</ref>

The [[Spanish Civil War]] began in July 1936, and caught As<U+00ED>n Palacios while with his nephew and family in [[San Sebasti<U+00E1>n]].  The horrors of this struggle remain very painful to contemplate regarding both sides; over four thousand priests were assassinated by extremist factions on loyalist side early in the conflict. As<U+00ED>n was in danger, yet that September nationalist forces captured San Sebasti<U+00E1>n. During the war he taught [[Latin]] and managed to obtain photocopies of Arabic texts.<ref>Valdivia V<U+00E1>lor, ''Don Miguel As<U+00ED>n Palacios'' at 34-35.</ref><ref>Monroe, ''Islam and the Arabs in Spanish Scholarhip'' at 192.</ref><ref>Emilio Garc<U+00ED>a G<U+00F3>mez, "Don Miguel As<U+00ED>n" in ''Al-Andalus'' 9:266-291 at 284-285 (1944).</ref>  

After the Civil War, As<U+00ED>n was able to return to his professorship in Madrid and to continue with his multi-volume study of Al-Ghazali.

Don Miguel As<U+00ED>n Palacios had intense black eyes, fine hands; photographs did not capture the totality of his expression. He was well dressed ("entre cardenal y torero"). Not ambitious but for the tranquility in which to work, he was a good and generous friend. His colleagues recognized in him an enduring innocence, so that he was "not knowing" in the mixed turbulence of the world.<ref>Garc<U+00ED>a G<U+00F3>mez affectionately commented that As<U+00ED>n sometimes would appear "un poco en la luna". "Don Miguel As<U+00ED>n (1873-1944) Esquema de una biograf<U+00ED>a" in ''Al-Andalus'' 9:266-291 at 289 (1944).</ref> He projected a brightness ("diafanidad"); his mind was a great work of refinement. A pious priest, an admirer of [[John Henry Newman]], "a child of 73 years" when he died.<ref>Emilio Garc<U+00ED>a G<U+00F3>mez, "Don Miguel As<U+00ED>n (1873-1944) Esquema de una biograf<U+00ED>a" in ''Al-Andalus'' 9:266-291 at 287-289 (1944).</ref> 

That was on [[August 12]], [[1944]], in San Sebasti<U+00E1>n.

==Works==
Following early publications on ''Algazal'' (Al-Ghazali) and ''Mohid<U+00ED>n Abenarabi'' (Ibn 'Arabi) as noted above, As<U+00ED>n Palacios discussed, edited and rendered into Spanish translation many Arabic writings, and composed books and essays on related themes, including an occasional piece in Latin, French, or Italian.<ref>See "Selected Publications" section below. For descriptions of different critiques of As<U+00ED>n's works generally, see Valdivia V<U+00E1>lor, ''Don Miguel As<U+00ED>n Palacios'' at 147-175; also the "Selected Commentary" section, infra.</ref>

===Aquinas & Averro<U+00EB>s===
As<U+00ED>n Palacios researched Muslim influence on [[Thomas Aquinas|Tom<U+00E1>s d'Aquino]] (c.1225-1274), which would come particularly from the philosopher Ibn Rushd or [[Averroes|Averro<U+00EB>s]] (1126-1198) of C<U+00F3>rdoba, whether as protagonist or antagonist. The result was his 1904 article.<ref>"El Averro<U+00ED>smo teol<U+00F3>gico de Santo Tom<U+00E1>s de Aquino" (1904), reprinted in ''Huellas del Islam'' (1941), at 11-72.</ref> With respect to [[Greek philosophy]], particularly [[Aristotle]], As<U+00ED>n infers the analogous religio-philosophic positions held by both Averro<U+00EB>s and Aquinas, and as well by ben Maimon or [[Maimonides]] (1135-1204) the Jewish philosopher and [[talmud]]ist, also from [[C<U+00F3>rdoba, Spain|C<U+00F3>rdoba]].<ref>Asin Palacios, ''Ibid.'' (1904), in ''Huellas del Islam'', e.g., cf. section VI at 63-64.</ref> As<U+00ED>n understood that it was with piety that Averro<U+00EB>s used reason to interpret his Islamic faith, and probes this issue for the sake of distinguishing him from several of the Latin "[[Averroists|Averro<U+00ED>stas]]".<ref>''Ibid.'' (1904), in ''Huellas del Islam'', III at 43, 45-46, 49. Earlier As<U+00ED>n quotes extensively from Averro<U+00EB>s, II at 21-41.</ref> As<U+00ED>n also refers to medieval [[voluntarism (philosophy)|voluntarism]] (or ''asaries'' in Islam), in order to supply a contrast to the similarity in the rationalisms of Averro<U+00EB>s and Aquinas.<ref>''Ibid.'' (1904), in ''Huellas del Islam'', IV at 52, V at 57-60.</ref> Yet, many [[Thomists]] did not then accept without great controversy Asin's point of view.<ref>P. Chalmeta Gendr<U+00F3>n, "As<U+00ED>n Palacios, Miguel" in ''Gran Enciclopedia Rialp'' [GER] (1991) [http://canalsocial.net GER]. As a medieval tactician, St. Thomas did write his ''De Unitate Intellectus Contra Averroistas'' or ''On the Unity of the Intellect against the Averroists'' (Marquette Univ. 1968); cf., Etienne Gilson, ''The Spirit of Mediaeval Philosophy'' (New York: Scribners 1936) at 176-178, 182-183. Nonetheless, what As<U+00ED>n presents here may be considered a modernist view point through a wide-angle lens, a [[philosophical anthropology]].</ref>

===Ibn Masarra===
In his 1914 book, ''Abenmasarra y su escuela. Or<U+00ED>genes de la filosof<U+00ED>a hispano-musulmana'',<ref>Translated by Douglas and Yoder as ''The Mystical Philosophy of Ibn Masarra and his Followers'' (Leiden: E. J. Brill 1978).</ref> As<U+00ED>n opens by describing the evolution of [[Islamic philosophy]] and [[Islamic cosmology|cosmology]] at the [[Abbasid dynasty|center of Islamic civilization]] in the East, in comparison with its emergence and development in [[Al-Andalus|Muslim Iberia]].<ref>''The Mystical Philosophy'' (1914, 1978), Chapters I [1-14] and II [15-29].</ref> A brief biography of Ibn Masarra follows, describing accusations of heresy and that he early concealed his teachings.<ref>''The Mystical Philosophy'' (1914, 1978), Chap. III [30-42], at 33, 35, 38, 40-42.</ref> Actually As<U+00ED>n's work is less about [[Ibn Masarra]] (883-931) of Cordova, than about his "school" of early Muslim mystics in al-Andalus.<ref>In 1914 As<U+00ED>n thought that not a single work of Ibn Masarra nor any fragments survived [''The Mystical Philosophy'' at IV:43]. As<U+00ED>n inferred his school's original teachings based on, e.g.,  medieval biographers (al-Faradi, al-Dabbi, Ibn Khaqan, and al-Maqqari [III:32,n.6]), two Iberian commentators (Ibn Hazm, and Sa'id of Toledo [IV:43]), and on the writings of his followers (in particular Ibn 'Arabi) [IV:43-44] and of his adversaries. Two manuscripts of Ibn Masarra have now been located (''Kitab al-huruf'' [Book of Letters], & ''Kitab al-tabsira'' [Book of Clear Explanation]); very recently both have been translated into Spanish by Pilar Garrido. As<U+00ED>n knew of these titles only from references to them by others, e.g., [[Ibn Hazm]] [III:41,n.23].</ref> With reference to their teachings and the religious context, As<U+00ED>n discusses the [[Batin (Islam)|batini]], the [[mutazili]], the [[shi'a]], and [[sufism|sufis]], as well as [[Plotinus]], and especially the pseudo-Empedocles.<ref>As<U+00ED>n's theory that the pseudo-Empedocles was a source for Ibn Masarra himself has been challenged. Cf., Claude Addas, her ''Ibn 'Arabi ou La qu<U+00E9>te du Soufre Rouge'' (Paris: Editions Gallimard 1989), translated by [[Peter Kingsley (scholar)|Peter Kingsley]] as ''Quest for the Red Sulphur. The Life of Ibn 'Arabi'' (Cambridge: Islamic Texts Society 1993) at 57-58, and the article by S. M. Stern cited there at note 113.</ref>  As<U+00ED>n also mentions several times a perspective he favored, of eastern Christianity's early influence on the young religion before Islam's arrival in the west.<ref>''Abenmasarra y su escuela'' (1914), translated as ''The Mystical Philosophy of Ibn Masarra and his Followers'' (1978), e.g., at 2-3, 12-13, 28, 88-89, 91 (and in As<U+00ED>n's prior works referenced at 12, footnote 25). Cf., [[Robert Charles Zaehner|R.C.Zaehner]], ''Hindu and Muslim Mysticism'' (Univ.of London 1960; reprints: Schocken 1969, Oneworld 1994) at 86-87, 92, 112.</ref> As<U+00ED>n traces the persistence of the philosophy of Ibn Masarra's school, and its eventual influence on [[Ibn 'Arabi]], as well as on [[Ramon Lull]] and on [[Roger Bacon]].<ref>As<U+00ED>n, ''The Mystical Philosophy'' (1914, 1978) at 73-82, 123-143, 173-183 (Ibn 'Arabi); at 136-144, 173-183 (Ramon Lull); at 134-137, 144 (Roger Bacon). All three lived during the 13th century. Independently, [[Henry Corbin]] in his ''L'imagination cr<U+00E9>atrice dans le Soufisme d'Ibn 'Arabi'' (Paris: Flammarion 1958), translated as ''Creative Imagination in the Sufism of Ibn 'Arabi'' (Princeton Univ. [Bollingen] 1969), citing As<U+00ED>n at 25-26 & 48-49, "saw" connections through the ''alam al-mithal'' [subtle world] [35-36], between the ''school'' of Ibn Masarra via Ibn 'Arabi and the mystical philosophy of Muslim Iran, e.g., Suhrawardi's ''Ishraq'' [light]. For As<U+00ED>n's ''Abenmasarra'' (1914) in general, see: Valdivia V<U+00E1>lor, ''Don Miguel As<U+00ED>n Palacios'' at 107-114; Monroe, ''Islam and the Arabs in Spanish Scholarship'' at 180-182; Addas, ''Quest for the Red Sulphur'' at 57-59.</ref>

===Dante Alighieri===
Perhaps As<U+00ED>n Palacios is best remembered for his 1919 book, ''La Escatologia Musulmana en la Divina Comedia'',<ref>[Muslim eschatology in the Divine Comedy]. See below under "Selected Publications" for details on its editions.</ref><ref>Valdivia V<U+00E1>lor, ''Don Miguel As<U+00ED>n Palacios'' (1992) at 118-120, 150-160.</ref><ref>Monroe, ''Islam and the Arabs in Spanish Scholarship'' (1970) at 182-184.</ref> which suggests Islamic sources<ref>As<U+00ED>n refers to his own precursors, e.g., Bruno Nardi. ''La Escatologia Musulmana en la Divina Comedia'' (Madrid-Granada: Escuelas de Estudios <U+00C1>rabes, segunda edici<U+00F3>n, 1943) at 4; & 397-399, 452.</ref> for the memorable context and perspective used by the Italian poet [[Dante Alighieri]] (1265-1321) in his [[Divine Comedy|''La Divina Commedia'']]. Specifically, As<U+00ED>n compares the Muslim religious literature surrounding the [[mi'raj|night journey]] of [[Muhammad]] (from [[Mecca]] to [[Jerusalem]] and thence up with the [[Prophets of Islam|prophets]] through the seven [[jannah|heavens]]),<ref>The [[Mi'raj]] or ''night journey'' [''mi'ray'' in Spanish] is briefly mentioned in the [[Qur'an]] at the sura so named (XVII, 1-2), and perhaps alluded to twice more (LIII,1; LXXXIV, 19).</ref><ref>The Mi'raj is described authoritatively in [[Hadith]], e.g., of [[Sahih Muslim]], whose text in English can be found in ''Early Muslim Mysticism'' edited by Michael A. Sells (Paulist Press 1996) at 49-53.</ref><ref>The Mi'raj is also described by [[Ibn Ishaq]] (A.H. 85-151) in his "biography" of the prophet, in Alfred Guillaume (ed.), ''The Life of Muhammad.

Accordingly, As<U+00ED>n (I) discusses in detail the above night journey in Muslim literature,<ref>As<U+00ED>n, ''Escatologia'' at Part I, 9-120, and also Appendix I, 425-443.</ref> (II) compares it to episodes in the [[hell|inferno]],<ref>As<U+00ED>n, ''Escatologia'' at 133-175.</ref> the [[purgatory|purgatorio]],<ref>As<U+00ED>n, ''Escatologia'' at 175-191.</ref> and the [[heaven|paradiso]]<ref>As<U+00ED>n, ''Escatologia'' at 192-266.</ref> of ''La Divina Commedia'', (III) investigates Muslim influence on corresponding Christian literature predating the poem, and (IV) conjectures how Dante could have known directly of the Muslim literature in translation. As<U+00ED>n remarks that notwithstanding these Muslim sources, Dante remains a luminous figure and his poem retains its exalted place in world literature.<ref>As<U+00ED>n Palacios, ''La Escatologia Musulmana en la Divina Comedia'' (2d ed., 1943), e.g., at 420 (el "inspirado" florentino que por "su poema inmortal" alcanz<U+00F3> "enamorados de la belleza de su arte exquisito").</ref> As<U+00ED>n's book inspired a wide and energetic reaction, positive and negative, as well as [[Divine Comedy#The_Divine_Comedy_and_Islamic_philosophy|further research]] and academic exchanges.<ref>See the "Commentary" sections listed below, regarding: Massignon, G.

Cf., [http://www.emsf.rai.it/interviste/interviste.asp?d=490#3 Dante e l'Islam] (Italian interview with Maria Corti, April 2000). Latini's trip was probably circa 1259; he returned to [[Tuscany]] in 1266. Dante wrote ''La Divina Commedia'' much later, in his last years, 1308-1321. Prof. Corti comments on our surprise if Latini had given Dante a copy of the translation.</ref> Although this missing link was not available to As<U+00ED>n, he had based his work on several similar accounts of Muhammad's ladder then circulating among the Muslims of [[Al-Andalus]].<ref>As<U+00ED>n Palacios, ''La Escatologia Musulmana en la Divina Comedia'' (2d ed., 1943), especially in Part I at chapters 2 & 3, and translations in the first Appendix.

===Ibn Hazm===
As<U+00ED>n published two early works on [[Ibn Hazm]] (Abenh<U+00E1>zam) of [[C<U+00F3>rdoba, Spain|C<U+00F3>rdoba]] (994-1064),<ref>''Los caracteres y la conducta, tratado de moral pr<U+00E1>ctica por Abenh<U+00E1>zam de C<U+00F3>rdoba'' (Madrid 1916), a work on his ethics.</ref><ref>''El Cordob<U+00E9>s Abenh<U+00E1>zam, primer historador de las ideas religiosas'' (Madrid: Estanislao Maestre 1924).</ref> who was [[theology|theologian]], [[jurisprudence|jurist]],<ref>Ibn Hazm was then a leading [[Zahiri]] jurist.

In part 1 of the ''Fisal'', Ibn Hazm gives a polemical description of Christian [[New Testament|scriptures]] and [[Trinity|doctrine]], its putative errors and contradictions, showing familiarity with the texts; he also comments on [[Judaism]], [[Hinduism|Brahmans]], [[sophism|sophists]], [[atheism|atheists]], and [[polytheism|polytheists]]. As<U+00ED>n's biography discloses Ibn Hazm as once [[vizier]] to the declining [[Umayyad]] [[Caliphate of C<U+00F3>rdoba|caliphs]] before retiring to his study. A [[faqih|jurist]] of the ''[[Zahiri]]'' (or "literalist") [[madhhab|school of law]],<ref>Generally: [[Ignaz Goldziher]], ''Die Z<U+00E2>hiriten'' (Leipzig 1884), translated by W.Behn as ''The Zahiris. Their Doctrine and their History'' (Leiden 1971). Goldziher makes a reference to "Ibn Hazm who distinguishes himself by his fanatical enmity against everything non-Islamic." ''Ibid.'' at 56; also at 60, "his personal fanaticism against followers of other religions"; and at 122. Yet Goldziher also recognizes Ibn Hazm: "Among the champions of the Dawudi [Zahiri] school this remarkable man is known as the most famous by far." ''Ibid.'' at 109.</ref> Ibn Hazm's work ''Ibtal''<ref>Longer title: ''Ibtal al-qiyas wa-al-ra'y wa-al-istihsan wa-al-taqlid wa-al-ta'wil'' [Refutation of analogy, judge's opinion, public good, scholarly authority, and text interpretation]; in As<U+00ED>n's biography (vol. I). The Zahiris rejected the use of analogy, etc., in [[usul al-fiqh|legal method]].</ref> on [[fiqh]] is mentioned. In his ''Fisal'' Ibn Hazm addresses possible rebellion against an unjust [[Imam]].<ref>At part 4 of the ''Fisal'' (As<U+00ED>n's volume V, at 7-51), at chapter 4, on the "Necessity of the Imam" (As<U+00ED>n at 34-43). There Ibn Hazm distinguishes between not obeying an unjust order and taking action to overthrow an unjust ruler.</ref> Later, writings of Ibn Hazm were discovered in the library of the [[Fatih Mosque]] in [[Istanbul]], including legal ''responsa'', to which Asin devoted an article.<ref>"Un C<U+00F3>dice inexplorada de Cordob<U+00E9>s Ibn Hazm" in ''Al Andalus'', 2: 1-56 (1934).</ref>

===Ibn 'Arabi===
Another well known work by As<U+00ED>n addresses the life and mystical philosophy of [[Ibn 'Arabi]] (1165-1240) from the city of [[Murcia]]. As<U+00ED>n Palacios wrote a number of studies and translations of Muhyiddin Ibn 'Arabi,<ref>Six prior articles of As<U+00ED>n are listed in ''El Islam cristianizado'' at 6 note 1, as well as discussion of Ibn 'Arabi in his 1919 book on Dante. Several later articles by As<U+00ED>n are given in ''Al Andalus'', V: 239-241, 240 (1940), where As<U+00ED>n reviews the book of A.E.Affifi, ''The Mystical Philosophy of Muhyid Din Ibnul Arabi'' (1939); therein As<U+00ED>n refers to Ibn 'Arabi as "profound, knowledgeable and erudite, complicated and subtle, well versed in all the Islamic systems of thought." ''Ibid.'' at 241.</ref> but his major work was ''El Islam cristianizado. Estudio del sufismo a trav<U+00E9>s de las obras de Abenarabe de Murcia'' (1931).<ref>See "Selected Publications by As<U+00ED>n" below, under "Books". For discussion: Valdivia V<U+00E1>lor, ''Don Miguel As<U+00ED>n Palacios'' at 127-136, 162-174; Monroe, ''Islam and the Arabs in Spanish Scholarship'' at 188-189; Addas, ''Quest for the Red Sulphur'' at 1-10.</ref> Following an introduction regarding sufism, this book presents three parts: first, a short biography of Ibn 'Arabi [31-118]; second, commentaries on his [[mysticism|mystical]] teachings, and also on his place in [[sufism]] and his subsequent influence [119-274]; third, translations taken from seven works of Ibn 'Arabi [275-518].<ref>''Tohfa,'' ''Amr,'' ''Tadbirat,'' ''Cunh,'' ''Mawaqui,'' ''Anwar,'' and ''Fotuhat.''</ref> As<U+00ED>n Palacios was a western pioneer in Sufi studies, particularly regarding Ibn 'Arabi.<ref>Claude Addas, her ''Ibn 'Arabi ou La qu<U+00E9>te du Soufre Rouge'' (Paris: Editions Gallimard 1989), translated by [[Peter Kingsley (scholar)|Peter Kingsley]] as ''Quest for the Red Sulphur. The Life of Ibn 'Arabi'' (Cambridge: Islamic Texts Society 1993) at 1, and generally 1-10, in which As<U+00ED>n the pioneer undergoes a critique. Yet the Addas text at 40, note 24, apparently mistakes As<U+00ED>n's at 37, notes 1 & 2, which cites and quotes the ''Fotuhat'' [III:311 & I:363]. The very lengthy ''al-Futuhat al-makkiyya'' is the major work by Ibn 'Arabi; selections are translated in ''The Meccan Revelations'' (New York: Pir Press 2002 & 2004 [2 volumes]), edited by Michel Chodkiewicz [first published in French and English as ''Les Illuminations des la Mecque'' (Paris: Sinbad 1998).  The other major work by the very prolific Ibn 'Arabi is the ''Fusus al-hikam'' translated by R.W.J.Austin as ''The Bezels of Wisdom'' (Paulist Press 1980).</ref> Not surprisingly As<U+00ED>n assumes the viewpoint of a spiritually involved Christian academic; he sees in the works of Ibn 'Arabi many similarities with his own religion's mystical doctrines.  Consequently As<U+00ED>n brings this spiritually informed consciousness to his discussion of the principles and practices taught by Ibn 'Arabi. For example, As<U+00ED>n mentions the purgative preparation required by Ibn 'Arabi in the ''four deaths'': ''white'', death to hunger; ''red'', dying to passion; ''black'', to endure suffering; ''green'', to enter poverty.<ref>''El Islam cristianizado'' at 163 (& 339), citing Ibn 'Arabi's work ''Amr'' at 109, selections of which As<U+00ED>n translated (at 300-351) as ''Amr. La regla taxativa que fija las condiciones que deben cumplir los que siguen el camino de Dios'' [Restictive measures setting conditions to be fulfilled by those on the way of God].</ref> While some see adjacent virtues clearly, other mystics take a hard path of trials and of sorrows, to be humbled in the wilderness,<ref>Cf., ''El Islam cristianizado'' at 254-255 (& 390-392), which cites Ibn 'Arabi's ''Mawaqui'' [''Mawaqi' al-nujum''] at 193. As<U+00ED>n translated it in part (at 378-432) as ''Mawaqui. Descenso de los Astros y Ascensiones de los M<U+00ED>sticos''. As<U+00ED>n comments: "Para Abenarabi, ... la tristeza espiritual es la llave de las gracias de oraci<U+00F3>n y contemplaci<U+00F3>n, sin la cual el alma cae en la vanidad e ilusi<U+00F3>n de esp<U+00ED>ritu." [Suffering is key to the graces, else the soul becomes vain by spiritual illusions]. ''Ibid.'', at 254-255.</ref> yet later may enter transforming vision and mercifully receive a felicitous and loving unity.<ref>A characteristic doctrine of Ibn 'Arabi is ''wahdat al-wujud'' (the "unity of being"). [[William Chittick|Wm. Chittick]], ''The Sufi Path of Knowledge. Ibn al-'Arabi's Metaphysics of Imagination'' (SUNY 1989), at 79 (yet cf. 226). The ultimate abode on the mystic path is "love", ''mahaba''. ''El Islam cristianizado'', at 200; cf. Cap<U+00ED>tulo XIII, "El Amor de Dios".</ref> In his introduction, As<U+00ED>n observes that while Christian Spain became deeply affected by Muslim mysticism, beforehand the [[Eastern Christianity|oriental Church]] had equally affected early Islam,<ref>Miguel As<U+00ED>n Palacios, ''El Islam cristianizado'' (Madrid: Editorial Plutarco 1931; reprint Ediciones Hiperi<U+00F3>n 1990), e.g., at 12-13. The same year [[Margaret Smith (author)|Margaret Smith]] described this Christian influence in some detail in her ''Studies in Early Mysticism in the Near and Middle East'' (London: Sheldon Press 1931; reprint Oneworld 1995) at chapters VI, VII, and XI (reissued in 1976 as ''The Way of the Mystics'', reprint Oxford Univ. 1978).</ref> which later arrived in the far [[occidental|occident]] where Ibn 'Arabi would be born. From the perspective of [[religious studies]], it might be said that As<U+00ED>n Palacios at points presents us with a multidimensional text for [[comparative religion]]. In his other works on Sufi practice, As<U+00ED>n mentions precursors of Ibn 'Arabi in [[al-Andalus]] (i.e., the school of ''[[Ibn Masarra]]''), as well as those who drew on his teachings afterwards (e.g., the ''[[Shadhili|Sadilies]]'' or ''xadil<U+00ED>es'' [[tariqah]]).<ref>''El Islam cristianizado'' at 171-174; cf. "Selected Publications" below (e.g., ''Abenmasarra y su escuela'', and ''Sadilies y alumbrados''). Valdivia V<U+00E1>lor, ''Don Miguel As<U+00ED>n Palacios'' at 132-133; Monroe, ''Islam and the Arabs in Spanish Scholarship'' at 180-181, 193-194.</ref> Here also, As<U+00ED>n refers to the many parallels between [[al-Ghazali]] and Ibn 'Arabi.<ref>''El Islam cristianizado'', at 263 note 1, itemizing several with reference to the ''Fotuhat'', and noting that Ibn 'Arabi gave public courses at Mecca on the ''Ilya'' of al-Ghazali.</ref>

===Varia===
Among As<U+00ED>n's many articles are studies concerning the following subjects:<ref>Valdivia V<U+00E1>lor, ''Don Miguel As<U+00ED>n Palacios'' at 114-116 (Lull), 116-118 (Pascal), 125-126 (Ibn al-'Arif), 137-145 (Juan de la Cruz, Ibn 'Abbad of Ronda, Teresa of Avila, Sadilies and Alumbrados); Monroe, ''Islam and the Arabs in Spanish Scholarship'' at 190-191, 193-194; cf. [[Luce Lopez-Baralt|Luce L<U+00F3>pez-Baralt]], her "Estudio introductorio" to As<U+00ED>n's ''Sadilies y Alumbrados'' (1990), regarding St. John of the Cross, St. Teresa of Avila, as well as the Sadilies (a major Sufi ''[[tariqah]]'' located mainly in Northern Africa) and the Alumbrados;  & her ''Islam in Spanish Literature'' (1985, 1992) on the two saints (chapters III and IV); and as well her ''San Juan de la Cruz y el Islam'' (1985, 1990); and her "Saint John of the Cross and Ibn 'Arabi" (2000).</ref>

===Al-Ghazali===
In the 1930s, As<U+00ED>n began yet another study of [[Al-Ghazali|Algazel]] (1058-1111),<ref>As<U+00ED>n Palacios, ''La espiritualidad de Algazal y su sentido cristiano'' (Madrid-Granados: Escuelas de Estudios Arabes, 1934-1941). Nine of his prior works on al-Ghazali are cited by As<U+00ED>n, ''Ibid.'' at I: 20-21. Several of these are addressed by Valdivia V<U+00E1>lor in ''Don Miguel As<U+00ED>n Palacios'' at
97-102, 116-118, 120-123, and ''La espiritualidad de Algazal'' at 123-125, 147-150.</ref> expressly declaring it limited to a Christian interpretation.<ref>As<U+00ED>n states that he will purposely omit discussion of Muslim influence on al-Ghazali because already adequately covered by other scholars, e.g., Goldziher, Macdonald, Massignon, and Nicholson [Prologue at 9-10]. Monroe in his ''Islam and the Arabs in Spanish Scholarship'' at 191-192, 194-195, probes this approach by As<U+00ED>n, and censures what it may infer, citing a blanket critique of orientalists ("dry and sterile") made by [Seyyed] Hossein Nasr, ''Three Muslim Sages'' (Harvard Univ. 1964) at 156n1 (to text at 83).</ref> His investigation focuses on themes of spiritual practice from the forty volume ''magnum opus'' of al-Ghazali, the ''Ihya 'Ulum ad-Din'' [''Revival of the Religious Sciences''].<ref>Only a few volumes of al-Ghazali's ''Ihya'' have been translated into English, e.g., ''The Book of Knowledge'' or ''Kitab al-'ulm'' by Nabih Amin Faris (Lahore: Asraf 1962); and ''Remembrance of Death and the Afterlife'' or ''Kitab dhikr al-mawt wa ma ba'dahu'' by Timothy J. Winter (Cambridge: Islamic Text Society 1989).</ref> [[Arthur John Arberry|A. J. Arberry]] in 1942 called it "by far the most important monograph on Ghazali so far written," but adversely noted the importation of foreign religious sentiments into As<U+00ED>n's work on the Muslim theologian.<ref>A. J. Arberry, ''An Introduction to the History of Sufism'' (Oxford 1942) at 53; cited by Monroe at 192. Cf. Valdivia V<U+00E1>lor at 161. As<U+00ED>n saw Islam as manifesting some similarity to a Christian heresy in its doctrines, given its espoused heritage, e.g., refering to [[Ramadan]] and [[Lent]] [Prologue at 15-16]. As<U+00ED>n repeatedly noted the subsequent mutual influence between the religions, hence his perceived ''bona fides'' in a Christian approach to al-Ghazali. Gonz<U+00E1>lez Palencia, "Necrologia: Don Miguel As<U+00ED>n" in ''Arbor'' II: 179-206 (1944), e.g., at 193-194, 198; cited by Valdivia V<U+00E1>lor at 162-164. In this regard, As<U+00ED>n in his Prologue (''La espiritualidad de Algazal'' at I: 18-19) refers to the Syrian Christian theologian [[Bar Hebraeus|Bar 'Ebraya]] (1226-1286), his ''Book of the Dove'', in the annotated translation by Wensinck (1919). Another Syrian Christian theologian, [[John Damascene|Joannis Damascenus]] (676-749), in his ''Concerning Heresies'' discusses the "Heresy of the Ishmailites" at chapter 100 (attribution questioned), Muslims being called after [[Ishmael]] [Ismail] son of [[Abraham]] [Ibrahim].</ref> After addressing Al-Ghazali the person, including a short biography, As<U+00ED>n analyses the teachings of his ''Ihya'' in four parts: 1) his purgative ascetics, e.g., how to overcome sensuality, idle talk, anger and hatred, envy, worldliness, greed, glory, hypocrisy, pride, vanity, and spiritual illusion (in volume I); 2) his path to unity, e.g., penance, patience, gratitude, hope and fear, voluntary poverty, renunciation of the world, trusting in God, and love of God (vol. II); 3) his way to perfection, e.g., the life plan, purity and sincerity, conscience, meditation, and the religious song (vol. III); 4) al-Ghazali's mystical doctrine, to which As<U+00ED>n also provides a Christian interpretation.<ref>Discussion of the mystical is in As<U+00ED>n's third volume, at chapters 30 [211-268] and 31 [269-289].</ref> In the fourth, concluding volume, As<U+00ED>n translates selections from works by Al-Ghazali (21 titles other than the ''Ihya'') and provides a brief analysis of each.<ref>Included are selections from his well-known ''Tahafut al-falasifa'', or ''[[The Incoherence of the Philosophers]]''.</ref>

===John of the Cross===
In 1933 As<U+00ED>n published in the first issue of the journal ''Al-Andalus'' an article about [[St. John of the Cross|San Juan de la Cruz]] (1542-1591) and a doctrine he shared with spiritual Islam.<ref>"Un precursor hispano musulman de San Juan de la Cruz", which was later reprinted in ''Huellas del Islam'' (1941), at 235-304. An English translation was made by Douglas and Yoder as ''Saint John of the Cross and Islam'' (New York: Vantage 1981).</ref> This work can be seen to be equally about the saint's suggested forerunner, the Muslim mystic Ibn Abbad (1332-1389) of [[Ronda]], and about Ibn Abbad's own sources in the [[shadhili|Sadili]] school ([[tariqah]]).<ref>Over half of Asin's article is selected translations of a text by followers of the tariqah's founder, Abu'l-Hasan ash-Shadhili (1196-1258), i.e., the ''Maxims'' [''Kitab al-Hikam''] of Ibn 'Ata Allah of Alexandria (d.1258), with a commentary thereon by Ibn Abbad of Ronda.</ref> The doctrine shared<ref>Jos<U+00E9> Nieto, while not disputing the similarities discussed by As<U+00ED>n, is critical of any implied linkage between the earlier teachings of the [[shadhili|Sadili]] sufis and those of San Juan. For Nieto this mystical doctrine functions at a level of generality such that it will arise spontaneously. Nieto, ''Mystic Rebel Saint. A study of Saint John of the Cross'' (Geneva: Droz 1979) at 25-27. Cf., Swietlicki, ''Spanish Christian Cabala'' (1986) at 184.</ref> concerns the soul on the path toward union with the Divine; God, being unreachably transcendent, the soul's only approach is to renounce everything but God.<ref>Valdivia V<U+00E1>lor, ''Don Miguel As<U+00ED>n Palacios'' at 137-139, 138, citing As<U+00ED>n, ''Ibid.'' in ''Huellas del Islam'' at 249 [''Saint John of the Cross and Islam'' at section II, pages 12-13].</ref>  Thereby the soul enters a desolation in which he (or she) lives only for God, yet the desolation may become too severe, causing the soul to despair, so that the merciful Deity grants him (or her) inspiration, followed by a phase of elation; afterwards the soul returns to the way through desolation in order to move closer to God. The shared doctrine teaches that the soul passing through these alternating states of "[[Dark Night of the Soul|night]]" (contraction from despair) and "day" (inspired expansion) may relinquish the [[Spiritual gift|''charismata'']] of God's inspiring favors, so as to pass more quickly beyond the difficult rhythm of "night" and "day", so finding a repose, wherein to await the transforming union.<ref>As<U+00ED>n Palacios, ''Saint John of the Cross and Islam'' at section II, 11-13.</ref> As<U+00ED>n analyses the technical vocabulary used by the sadilis and by San Juan de la Cruz in order to further establish the connection.<ref>As<U+00ED>n, ''Saint John of the Cross and Islam'' at section III, 24-27. For further research which develops the work of Miguel As<U+00ED>n Palacios, see Luce L<U+00F3>pez-Baralt's book, ''San Juan de la Cruz y el Islam'' (1985, 1990).</ref>

===Teresa of Avila===
In a posthumously published article, As<U+00ED>n discusses [[St. Teresa of Avila|Santa Teresa de <U+00C1>vila]] (1515-1582).<ref>In ''Al Andalus'' XI:263-274 (1946), later reprinted in a collection of As<U+00ED>n's related articles (introduced by L<U+00F3>pez-Baralt), ''Sadilies y Alumbrados'' (1989) at 179-190. As<U+00ED>n had left it untitled (L<U+00F3>pez-Baralt, ''ibid.'', at xviii); now called: "El s<U+00ED>mil de los castillos y moradas del alma en la m<U+00ED>stica Islamica y en Santa Teresa" ["The figure of castles and dwellings of the soul in Islamic mysticism and in Saint Teresa"].</ref> The similes and analogies she employed to communicate the experiences of her spiritual life<ref>Specifically in Teresa's book ''Las Moradas o Castillo interior'' (1577), [''The Dwellings or interior Castle''], translated as ''Interior Castle'' by Kavanaugh in ''Saint Teresa of Avila'' (Paulist Press 1979), and by Peers (Sheed & Ward 1943, reprint Doubleday [Image Books] 1961).</ref> are discovered by As<U+00ED>n to parallel those previously employed by mystics of Islam. In this instance the image used is of seven dwelling places or castles, one inside the other.<ref>L<U+00F3>pez-Baralt, ''Huellas del Islam en la literatura espa<U+00F1>ola'' (1985), translated as ''Islam in Spanish Literature'' (1992), at 107-113 (commenting on As<U+00ED>n's article). For St. Teresa's image of the soul as seven concentric castles: L<U+00F3>pez-Baralt, ''Ibid.'', at 93; ''Interior Castles'' (Image 1961) at 11-13 [Peers' Introduction], and Santa Teresa's text at 28, 29, 37, etc.; also cf., E. Allison Peers, ''Studies of the Spanish Mystics'' (London 1927-1930), at I: 162-191. Santa Teresa previously used like imagery in her ''Camino de perfecci<U+00F3>n'' of 1566, at chapter 67 (cited by As<U+00ED>n at 185).</ref> As<U+00ED>n mentions the ''Tanwir''<ref>''Kitab al-tanwir fi isqat al-taqdir'', cited by As<U+00ED>n at 179, 180, 183, 186; as well as his ''Miftah'', at 183n1.</ref> of the [[Shadhili|sadili]] Ibn 'Ata Allah; the ''Tayrid''<ref>''Kitab al-tayrid'', or ''Libro de la desnudez espiritual'' [''Book of spiritual nakedness''], As<U+00ED>n at 181, 188.</ref> of Ahmad al-Gazali (brother of [[Algazel]]); and, the anonymous ''Nawadir''<ref>''Kitab nawadir'', redacted in 16th century from older material [183], cited by Asin at 183, 185, 186, 187, 190.</ref> compiled by Ahmad al-Qalyubi, with its seven concentric castles.<ref>As<U+00ED>n, at 183, 186; parallel in number and array.</ref> As<U+00ED>n draws out other mutualities in the matrix of symbols, e.g., the Divinity being in the central dwelling.<ref>At 182, 184, 186 in As<U+00ED>n. Among other coincidences: the demonic dog lurking outside, trying to enter [181, 183, 186].</ref> [[Luce Lopez-Baralt|Luce L<U+00F3>pez-Baralt]] further explores this association of images, tracing the parallel to a ninth century Islamic mystic of Baghdad, Abu-l-Hasan al-Nuri (d.907), whose ''Maqamat al-qulub'' [''Stations of the Heart''] describes seven castles, one inside the other, through which the soul travels toward God.<ref>[[Luce Lopez-Baralt|Luce L<U+00F3>pez-Baralt]], ''Huellas del Islam en la literatura espa<U+00F1>ola'' (Madrid: Hiperi<U+00F3>n 1985), translated as ''Islam in Spanish Literature'' (Leiden : E.J.Brill 1992) at 110; for Santa Teresa generally, Chapter Four, 191-142. L<U+00F3>pez-Baralt later translated al-Nuri into Spanish (Madrid 1999). Also: L<U+00F3>pez-Baralt, ''The Sufi Trobar Clus and Spanish Mysticism'' (Lahore 2000, as translated by Huxley) re St. Teresa and al-Nuri at 75-85, while she refers to As<U+00ED>n's work at 79-82, 85-87.</ref> After quoting a passage in which Sta. Teresa describes her spontaneous acquaintance with the castle image,<ref>L<U+00F3>pez-Baralt, ''Islam in Spanish Literature'' (1985, 1992) at 91-92 text, and at note 2.</ref> L<U+00F3>pez-Baralt infers that Sta. Teresa's acquisition of the Islamic parallel was indirect, probably a popular allusion that lay dormant within her for years, resurfacing later to help her communicate her mystical experiences.<ref>L<U+00F3>pez-Baralt, ''Islam in Spanish Literature'' at 91, note 2; she discounts a possible "[[Carl Gustav Jung|Junigian]]" dimension to the symbolic similarities.</ref> Following related studies,<ref>E.g., Francisco Marquez Villanueva, "El s<U+00ED>mil del Castillo interior: sentido y g<U+00E9>nesis" in ''Acta del Congreso Internacional Teresiano'' (Univ. Pontifica de Salamanca 1983); J.A.Carpenter and Come Carpenter, "La experiencia y la escatolog<U+00ED>a m<U+00ED>stica de Santa Teresa y sus paralelos en el Islam medieval de los sufis" at 159-187 in ''Actas del I Congreso Internacional sobre Santa Teresa y la M<U+00ED>stica Hispanica'' edited by Manuel Criado de Val (Madrid 1984).</ref> Catherine Swietlicki discusses Saint Teresa's Jewish heritage,<ref>Santa Teresa's father, Don Alonso Sanchez de Cepeda, was pius and learned; his father (her grandfather) was a "New Christian" or Jewish [[converso]]. Cf., Swietlicki, ''Spanish Christian Cabala'' (1986) at 49-51.</ref> and her mysticism as filtered through the mutual presence of three faiths.<ref>Catherine Swietlicki, ''Spanish Christian Cabala. The Works of Luis de Leon, Santa Teresa de Jesus, and San Juan de la Cruz'' (Univ. Missouri 1986), i.e., St. Teresa and the Cabala generally at 51-81, re Sufis and the seven castles at 62-66; Swietlicki cited by L<U+00F3>pez-Baralt, ''Islam in Spanish Literature'' at 127-131, 134.</ref> The Catholic writings of Santa Teresa de <U+00C1>vila, widely recognized and revered, may accordingly be understood to reflect as well a generality of shared values among the Judaic, Christian, and Islamic faiths during those blessed periods of ''convivencia'' in medieval Spain.<ref>"Convivencia" signifies "living together" in Spanish, and may refer to a early medieval ''Golden Age'' ideal, in which the three faiths would share their cultures in peace. Prof. As<U+00ED>n contributed to the reification of the third pillar.</ref>

==Perspectives==
The works of As<U+00ED>n Palacios are widely admired, notwithstanding criticism that his view point was of a Christian priest while involved in the neutral academic field of [[Islamic studies]]. In his own country, the labors of the Spanish Arabists, to which he contributed greatly, has over the generations worked to favorably alter the view shared by many Spaniards concerning the Muslim period of their history. His spiritual insights into Islamic mysticism illuminated formerly obscure figures and hidden connections. Perhaps, too, along with [[Louis Massignon]] and others, it can be said that the Professor Rev. Miguel As<U+00ED>n Palacios was instrumental in the open recognition by the Catholic Church of Islam as a legacy of Abraham, articulated in the [[Nostra Aetate]] documents of [[Vatican II]] (1962-1965).
