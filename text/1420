==Biography==

===Early life===

Charles Edward Russell was born in [[Davenport, Iowa]] on September 25, 1860. His father was a newspaper editor at the ''Davenport Gazette'', and a noted abolitionist. He attended St. Johnsbury Academy, in [[Vermont]], for his high school education and also worked under his father while at the newspaper.<ref>Lloyd J. Graybar, "Charles Edward Russell" in John D. Buenker and Edward R. Kantowicz (eds.), ''Historical Dictionary of the Progressive Era, 1890-1920.'' Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1988; pg. 411.</ref>  His first cousin was [[Frederick Russell Burnham]], who became a celebrated scout and the inspiration for the [[scouting|boy scouts]].<ref name="scouting">{{cite book |last=Burnham |first=Frederick Russell |authorlink=[[Frederick Russell Burnham]] |title=Scouting on Two Continents |publisher=Doubleday, Page & company |year=1926 |pages=2; Chapters 3 & 4 |id={{OCLC |407686}} |isbn=0-86920-126-3}}</ref>

Russell wrote for the ''[[Minneapolis Journal]]'', the ''[[Detroit Tribune]]'', the ''[[New York World]]'', [[William Randolph Hearst]]'s ''[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]'', and the ''[[New York Herald]]''. He was employed as a newspaper writer and editor in New York and Chicago from 1894 to 1902, working successively for the ''[[New York World]],'' the ''[[New York American]],'' and the ''[[Chicago American]].''<ref>Lloyd J. Graybar, "Charles Edward Russell," pp. 411-412.</ref>

Russell joined the [[Socialist Party of America]] in 1908, of which he remained a member until his expulsion in 1917 over his support of American intervention in the [[World War I|First World War]].<ref name="Graybar412">Lloyd J. Graybar, "Charles Edward Russell," pg. 412.</ref>

===Social democratic politician===

Russell was the Socialist candidate for [[Governor of New York]] in [[New York state election, 1910|1910]] and [[New York state election, 1912|1912]], and for [[U.S. Senator from New York]] in [[New York state election, 1914|1914]]. He also ran for [[Mayor of New York City]]. Due to Russell's belief that Germany was an undeniable threat to the U.S., in 1915 he unexpectedly came out in support President [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s war "preparedness campaign".  This decision painted Russell into a tight corner politically as the majority of the SP's rank and file remained strongly [[anti-war]]. Socialist Party leader Eugene Debs believed that Russell's decision to support Wilson's move for rearmament probably cost Russell the party's [[President of the United States|Presidential]] nomination in 1916. Later that year, Russell separated from his party, and became apart of a group known as, "prowar socialists".<ref name="Miraldi"/> While Debs disagreed profoundly with Russell on the issue, he applauded him for the courage of his convictions.<ref>Eugene V. Debs, [http://www.marxisthistory.org/history/usa/parties/spusa/1916/0129-debs-russellwarviews.pdf "Russell and his War Views,"] Letter to the Editor of '''The American Socialist''', [Chicago], v. 2, no. 29, whole no. 169 (January 29, 1916), p. 4.</ref>

===Muckraking journalist===

[[File:USArussellCE2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Russell as drawn by Art Ward in 1912.]]
In his memoirs, ''Bare Hands and Stone Walls,'' Russell stated that "transforming the world...to a place where one can know some peace...some joy of living, some sense of the inexhaustible beauties of the universe in which he has been placed", was the purpose that inspired his work and his life. Russell felt very strongly about the well-being of others, after seeing the struggles that people all over New York had to undergo. These struggles included the unfair working conditions and wages in which people from all walks of life were forced to endure. People were placed into cramped working spaces with few, if any breaks. Aside from the physical conditions, most big employers did not value the well-being of their employees, especially the immigrants. With these horrendous mental images in place, Russell became inspired <ref name="Miraldi">{{cite web|last=Miraldi|first=Robert|title=Russell, Charles Edward|url=http://www.anb.org/articles/16/16-01426.html?a=1&n=russell%20charles&d=10&ss=0&q=4|publisher=American National Biography Online|accessdate=October 1, 2013}}</ref> 
 
He was one of a group of journalists at the turn of the 20th century who were called [[muckrakers]].  They investigated and reported<U+2014>not with cold detachment<U+2014>but with feeling and rage about the horrors of capitalism. This type of reporting became known as "Yellow journalism." Yellow journalism and the muckraker movement helped to jumpstart numerous reforms that included: prison conditions, railroads, church building conditions and other practices.<ref name="Miraldi"/> 

In ''Soldier for the Common Good'', an unpublished dissertation on Russell's life, author Donald Bragaw writes: "[[Historian]] [[Louis Filler]] has called Russell the leader of the muckrakers for contributing 'important studies in almost every field in which they ventured.' Shortly after his hiatus from writing due to the death of his first wife, Russell wrote one of his best books, "The Greatest Trust in the World," exposing the horrific ways of the meatpacking industry.<ref name="Miraldi"/>

Russell's reports on the corrupt practices and inhuman conditions at [[Union Stock Yards|Chicago stock yards]] were the inspiration for [[Upton Sinclair]]'s powerful novel ''[[The Jungle]]'', which caused a national uproar that led to inspection reforms. Comparable to the writings of Upton Sinclair, Russell's most controversial expose was fixated on the Trinity Church. This report was detrimental to the church's reputation as it accused the church of being one of the leading slum landlords in New York City. This accusation resulted in the church taking swift action by cleaning up or selling the worst of their properties.<ref name="Miraldi"/> 
After traveling all over the world in investigative journalism, Russell's beliefs about capitalism began to form stronger and stronger. He believed that capitalism itself was quite faulty and that the financial endeavors of the United States that led the economy were corrupt. As his convictions became deeper, Russell recognized that his beliefs were in line with that of the Socialist party, leading him to join in 1908.<ref name="Miraldi"/>

Aligning himself with Upton Sinclair, among others on the right wing of the party, Russell continued to agitate for "responsible...Marxian" positions inside the Socialist Party through 1917.

After the [[February Revolution]], Russell was named by Woodrow Wilson to join a mission led by [[Elihu Root]] intended to keep the [[Russian Provisional Government|Provisional Government]] of [[Alexander Kerensky]] in the war.  The mission report recommended that [[George Creel]]'s [[Committee on Public Information]] conduct pro-war [[propaganda]] efforts in [[Russia]]. Russell personally lobbied Wilson to use the relatively new medium of film to influence the Russian public.

Participation on the Root Mission was effectively a burning of bridges with the Socialist Party, which remained solidly opposed to the European war. Russell left the Socialist Party to join the [[Social Democratic League of America]]. He also worked with the [[American Federation of Labor|AFL]] to help found the patriotic [[American Alliance for Labor and Democracy]], an organization which agitated on behalf of American participation in the war among the country's workers.

He died on April 23, 1941 in [[Washington, D.C.]]

===NAACP founder===

In 1909, Russell was among sixty inspirational men and women such as [[Oswald Garrison Villard|Oswald Villard]], [[William English Walling|William Walling]], [[Ida B. Wells]], [[W. E. B. Du Bois]], [[Jane Addams]], and [[Lillian Wald]] who worked together to found the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]], formed in the aftermath of a [[race riot]] at [[Springfield, Illinois]] in August of the previous year.<ref name="Graybar412" /><ref>{{cite web|title=NAACP History Interactive Timeline|url=http://www.naacphistory.org/Default.aspx?AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport=1#/home|accessdate=October 10, 2013}}</ref> Russell's participation in the founding of the NAACP stemmed from his experiences with violence and racism as a child. One of the most memorable experiences included his father nearly being hanged for simply opposing slavery.<ref name="Miraldi"/>  Russell served and participated on the board of directors for the NAACP for the remainder of his life. 

===Later years===

Russell subsequently became an editorial writer for [[social democrat]]ic magazine ''[[The New Leader]]''.<ref>Max Shachtman and James Burnham, [http://www.marxists.org/history/etol/writers/burnham/1939/intellectuals/part3.htm#s2 "Intellectuals in Retreat III: The Actual Program,"] ''New International,'' vol. 5, no. 1 (Jan. 1939), pp. 3-22.</ref>

===Death and legacy===

C.E. Russell died on April 23, 1941 in [[Washington, DC]]. He was 80 years old at the time of his death.

Russell's involvement in the formation of the NAACP is perhaps one his most lasting legacies.
