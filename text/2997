'''Anuradhapura''' ({{lang-si|<U+0D85><U+0DB1><U+0DD4><U+0DBB><U+0DCF><U+0DB0><U+0DB4><U+0DD4><U+0DBB><U+0DBA> }}; [[Tamil language|Tamil]]: <small><U+0B85><U+0BA9><U+0BC1><U+0BB0><U+0BBE><U+0BA4><U+0BAA><U+0BC1><U+0BB0><U+0BAE><U+0BCD></small> is a major city in [[Sri Lanka]]. It is the capital city of [[North Central Province, Sri Lanka]] and the capital of [[Anuradhapura District]].  Anuradhapura is one of the ancient capitals of [[Sri Lanka]], famous for its well-preserved ruins of ancient Sri Lankan civilization. It was 3rd capital of the [[Kingdom of Rajarata]] after [[Kingdom of Tambapanni|Tambapanni]] and [[Kingdom of Upatissa Nuwara|Upatissa Nuwara]].

The city, now a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]], was the center of [[Theravada]] [[Buddhism]] for many centuries. The city lies 205&nbsp;km north of the current capital [[Colombo]] in Sri Lanka's [[North Central Province, Sri Lanka|North Central Province]], on the banks of the historic [[Malvathu Oya]]. It is one of the [[List of cities by time of continuous habitation|oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world]] and one of the eight [[World Heritage Sites of Sri Lanka]].

It is believed that from the 4th century BC, it was the capital of the [[Sinhala people|Sinhalese]] until the beginning of the 11th century AD. During this period it remained one of the most stable and durable centers of political power and urban life in South Asia. The ancient city, considered sacred to the Buddhist world, is today surrounded by monasteries covering an area of over sixteen square miles (40&nbsp;km<U+00B2>).

== The city ==

;Protohistoric Iron Age
Although according to historical records the city was founded in the 5th century BC, the archaeological data put the date as far back as the 10th century BC.<ref>SU Deraniyagala,''The Prehistory of Sri Lanka'', Vol II, Department of Archaeological Survey, Colombo: 1992. p435.</ref> Very little evidence was available about the period before the 5th century BC (i.e. the protohistoric period), though excavations have revealed information about the earlier inhabitants of the city.

Further excavations in Anuradhapura have uncovered information about the existence of a protohistoric habitation of humans in the citadel. The protohistoric Iron Age which spans from 900 to 600&nbsp;BC, marked the appearance of iron technology, pottery, the horse, domestic cattle and paddy cultivation. In the time period 700 to 600&nbsp;BC the settlement in Anuradhapura had grown over an area of at least 50 [[Hectare|ha]]. The city was strategically situated of major ports northwest and northeast, it was surrounded by irrigable and fertile land. The city was also buried deep in the jungle providing natural defence from invaders.

;Lower Early Historic period
The Lower Early Historic period, spanning from 500 to 250 BC, is studied on the lines of the chronicles. During this time King [[Pandukabhaya]] formally planned the city, with gates, quarters for traders etc. The city at the time would have covered an area of 1 square kilometre which makes it one of the largest in the continent at the time.

The layout of Anuradhapura as described in the [[Mahavamsa]]:

:"He laid out  four suburbs as well as the Abhaya-tank, the common cemetery, the place of execution, and the chapel of the Queens of the West, the banyan-tree of Vessavana and the Palmyra-palm of the Demon of Maladies, the ground set apart for the Yonas and the house of the Great Sacrifice; all these he laid out near the west gate." <ref name="Mahavamsa X">[http://mahavamsa.org/2008/05/10-consecrating-pandukabhaya/ Mahavamsa X], trans. [[Wilhelm Geiger]]</ref>

:"A hermitage was made for many ascetics; eastward of that same cemetery the ruler built a house for the nigantha Jotiya.(...) On the further side of Jotiya's house and on this side of the Gamani tank he likewise built a monastery for wandering mendicant monks, and a dwelling for the ajivakas and a residence for the brahmans, and in this place and that he built a lying-in shelter and a hall for those recovering from sickness." <ref name="Mahavamsa X"/>

It is believed that King [[Pandukabhaya]] made it his capital in the 4th century BC, and that he also laid out the town and its suburbs according to a well organized plan. He constructed a reservoir named [[Abhayavapi]]. He established shrines for yakkhas such as Kalawela and Cittaraja. He housed the Yaksini-Cetiya in the form of a mare within the royal precincts and offerings were made to all these demi-gods every year. He chose the sites for the cemetery and for the place of execution, the Chapel of the Western Queen, the Pacchimarajini, the Vessavana Banyan Tree, the Palm of the Vyadhadeva, the Yona Quarter and the House of the Great Sacrifice. The slaves or Candalas were assigned their duties and a village was set apart for them. They build dwellings for Niganthas, for wandering ascetics and for Ajivakas and Brahmanas. He established, the village boundaries. The tradition that King [[Pandukabhaya]] made Anuradhapura the capital city of [[Sri Lanka]] as early as the 4th century BC had been very important.

The administrative and sanitary arrangements be made for the city and the shrines he provided indicate that over the years the city developed according to an original master plan. His son Mutasiva, succeeded to the throne. During his reign of sixty years, he maintained Anuradhapura as his capital and further laid out the [[Mahameghavana]] Garden which was to play an important role in the early history of Buddhism in Sri Lanka. It was in the period of his successor, his son [[Devanampiya Tissa of Sri Lanka|Devanampiya Tissa]], that Buddhism was first introduced this island 236 years after the passing away of the Buddha. Emperor Ashoka in India was a contemporary of Devanampiya Tissa. 
<U+201C>Mahinda<U+201D> was the son of Emperor Ashoka of India. King Ashoka embraced Buddhism after he was inspired by a very small monk named <U+201C>Nigrodha.<U+201D>  The King who was in great misery after seeing the loss of life caused by his waging wars to expand his empire, was struck by the peaceful countenance of such a young monk.  Meeting this young monk made a turning point in his life and he thereafter, renounced wars. He was determined to spread the message of peace, to neutralize the effects from the damages caused by him through his warfare. As a result both his son and daughter were ordained as Buddha disciples, and became enlightened as Arahats.  In his quest to spread the message of peace instead of war, he sent his son Mahinda, to the island of Lanka, which was also known as  <U+201C>Sinhal<U+00E9><U+201D>.  
According to Dipavamsa and Mahavamsa, Thera [[Mahinda]] came to Sri Lanka from India on the full moon day of the month of Poson (June) and met King [[Devanampiyatissa]] and the people, and preached the doctrine.
Historically this period is believed to extend from 250 to 210&nbsp;BC. This is the point at which a kingship began and a civilization developed based on one of the most significant religions of [[South Asia]], [[Buddhism]].

===Buddhism and Anuradhapura===
<!---Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:Jaya sri maha bodhi.jpg|thumb|Flags and devotees at the [[Sri Maha Bodhi]]--->

With the introduction of Buddhism, the city gained more prominence and the great building era began. The [[Mahavansa]] states that King [[Kutakannatissa]] built the first city wall to a height of seven [[cubit]]s with a moat in front of the wall. This fortification was further enlarged by raising the wall a further 11 cubits to 18 cubits by King [[Vasabha]]. The king also added fortified gatehouses at the entrances of which the ruins can be seen to date. The Mahavamsa also states that soothsayers and architects were consulted in the construction.

During the late Anuradhapura period, the royal family and nobility of Sri Lanka strongly supported Buddhism. As such, they frequently commissioned works of art and donated these items to Buddhist temples. In return, the temple and local Buddhist community supported the king's rule. Art works featuring depictions of Avalokitesvara, the Bodhisattva of Mercy and Compassion, became increasing popular.<ref name=BMA>{{cite book|last=[[Birmingham Museum of Art]]|title=Birmingham Museum of Art : guide to the collection|year=2010|publisher=Birmingham Museum of Art|location=[Birmingham, Ala]|isbn=978-1-904832-77-5|pages=57|url=http://artsbma.org}}</ref>

===The city grows===
The city's popularity grew both as a ritual centre and as the administrative centre, a large population was attracted to the city for permanent settlement. Thus the living facilities were improved to accommodate the expanding population. King [[Vasabha]] constructed many ponds which were fed by a network of subterranean channels which were constructed to supply water to the city. [[Tissa]] and [[Abhayavapi]] tanks were built, the Nuwara weva was built and the Malwatu Oya was dammed to build the Nachchaduwa wewa which was {{convert|4408|acre|km2}} in size.

Parks were also provided in the city. The Ranmasu Uyana below the bund of Tissavapi or Tissa weva was one such, but it was strictly reserved for the members of the royal family. Health care and education were two other aspects to which the authorities paid attention. There were several hospitals in the city. In the 4th century King Upatissa II provided quarters and homes for the crippled and the blind. King [[Buddhadasa]] (337-365&nbsp;AD), himself a physician of great repute, appointed a physician to be in charge of every ten villages. For the maintenance of these physicians, one tenth of the income from the fields was set apart. He also set up refuges for the sick in every village. Physicians were also appointed to look after the animals. Kassapa V (914-923&nbsp;AD) founded a hospital close to the southern gate of Anuradhapura. General Sena in the 10th century is believed to have built a hospital close to the ceremonial street (Managala Veediya). The history of medical care began early, for in the 4th century BC King [[Pandukabhaya of Anuradhapura|Pandukhabaya]], in the course of sanitizing the town constructed a hospital. A large workforce was entrusted with the task of keeping the city clean.

Large lakes were also constructed by the city's rulers to irrigate paddy lands and also to supply water to the city. Nuwara wewa and Tissa wewa are among the best known lakes in the city.

===The Great City===
Anuradhapura attained its highest magnificence about the commencement of the [[common era]].  The city had some of the most complex irrigation systems of the ancient world, situated in the dry zone of the country the administration built many tanks to irrigate the land. Most of these tanks still survive.

=== Pictures found in the oldest great city at Anuradhapura excavations ===

According to carbon dating, the ruins excavated were from the 10th century BC.

=== In ruins ===

The ruins consist of three classes of buildings, ''[[dagobas]]'', monastic buildings, and ''pokunas''. The ''dagobas'' are bell-shaped masses of masonry, varying from a few feet to over 1100&nbsp;ft (340&nbsp;m) in circumference. Some of them contain enough masonry to build a town for twenty-five thousand inhabitants. Remains of the monastic buildings are to be found in every direction in the shape of raised stone platforms, foundations and stone pillars. The most famous is the Brazen Palace erected by King [[Dutugamunu]] about 164 BC. The ''pokunas'' are bathing-tanks or tanks for the supply of drinking water, which are scattered everywhere through the jungle. The city also contains a sacred [[Bo-Tree]], which is said to date back to the year 245 BC.
