'''''Alien vs. Predator''''' (also known as '''''AVP''''' or '''''AVP: Alien vs. Predator''''') is a 2004 American [[science fiction]] [[action film]] directed by [[Paul W. S. Anderson]] and starring [[Sanaa Lathan]] and [[Lance Henriksen]]. It is the first installment of the [[Alien vs. Predator (franchise)|''Alien vs. Predator'' franchise]], adapting a [[fictional crossover|crossover]] bringing together the eponymous creatures of the ''[[Alien (franchise)|Alien]]'' and ''[[Predator (franchise)|Predator]]'' series, a concept which originated in a [[Aliens Versus Predator (comics)|1989 comic book]]. Anderson, [[Dan O'Bannon]], and [[Ronald Shusett]] wrote the story, and Anderson and [[Shane Salerno]] adapted the story into a screenplay. Their writing was influenced by [[Aztec mythology]], the comic book series, and the writings of [[Erich von D<U+00E4>niken]].

Set in 2004, this film follows a group of [[archaeologists]] assembled by billionaire Charles Bishop Weyland (Henriksen) for an expedition near the Antarctic to investigate a mysterious heat signal. Weyland hopes to claim the find for himself, and his group discovers a pyramid below the surface of a whaling station. [[Hieroglyph]]s and sculptures reveal that the pyramid is a hunting ground for [[Predator (alien)|Predators]] who kill [[Alien (creature in Alien franchise)|Aliens]] as a [[rite of passage]]. The humans are caught in the middle of a battle between the two species and attempt to prevent the Aliens from reaching the surface.

The film was released on 13 August 2004 in North America and received mixed to negative reviews from film critics. The film grossed over $172 million at the worldwide box office. The film is followed by a sequel ''[[Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem]]'' (2007).

==Plot==
In 2004, a [[satellite]] detects a mysterious heat bloom beneath [[Bouvet Island|Bouvet<U+00F8>ya]], an island about one thousand miles off the coast of [[Antarctica]]. Wealthy industrialist Charles Bishop Weyland ([[Lance Henriksen]]) discovers through thermal imaging that there is a pyramid buried 2000ft beneath the ice. Weyland wants to claim it for his multinational communications company, Weyland Industries and so assembles a team of experts to go investigate. The team includes archaeologists, linguistic experts, drillers, mercenaries, and a guide named Alexa Woods ([[Sanaa Lathan]]).

As a [[Predator (alien)|Predator]] ship reaches Earth's orbit, it blasts a shaft through the ice towards the source of the heat bloom. When the humans arrive at the site above the heat source, an abandoned [[Whaling|whaling station]], they find the shaft and descend beneath the ice. They locate the mysterious [[pyramid]] and begin to explore it, finding evidence of a civilization predating written history and what appears to be a sacrificial chamber filled with human skeletons with ruptured [[Human rib cage|rib cages]].

Meanwhile, three Predators land and kill the humans on the surface, making their way down to the pyramid and arriving just as the team unwittingly powers up the structure. An [[Alien (creature in Alien franchise)|Alien]] queen awakes from [[Cryopreservation|cryogenic stasis]] and begins to produce eggs, from which facehuggers hatch and attach to several humans trapped in the sacrificial chamber. Chestbursters emerge from the humans and quickly grow into adult Aliens. Conflicts erupt between the Predators, Aliens, and humans, resulting in several deaths. Unbeknownst to the others, a Predator is implanted with an Alien [[embryo]].

Through translation of the pyramid's [[hieroglyph]]s the explorers learn that the Predators have been visiting Earth for thousands of years. It was they who taught early human civilizations how to build pyramids, and were worshiped as gods. Every 100 years they would visit Earth to take part in a [[rite of passage]] in which several humans would sacrifice themselves as hosts for the Aliens, creating the "ultimate prey" for the Predators to hunt. If overwhelmed, the Predators would activate their self-destruct weapons to eliminate the Aliens and themselves. The explorers deduce that this is why the current Predators are at the pyramid, and that the heat bloom was to attract humans for the purpose of making new Aliens to hunt.

The remaining humans decide that the Predators must be allowed to succeed in their hunt so that the Aliens do not reach the surface. Unfortunately, as the battle continues, almost all of the humans and Predators are killed, leaving only Alexa and a single Predator to fight against the Aliens. The two form an alliance and use the Predator's self-destruct device to destroy the pyramid and the remaining Aliens. Alexa and the Predator reach the surface, where they battle the escaped Alien queen. They defeat the queen by attaching its chain to a water tower and pushing it over a cliff into the water, dragging the queen to the ocean floor. The Predator, however, dies from its wounds.

A Predator ship [[cloaking device|uncloaks]] and several Predators appear. They collect their fallen comrade and present Alexa with one of their spear weapons in recognition of her skill as a warrior. As they retreat into space, a chestburster with Predator-like features erupts from the dead Predator, beginning the events of ''[[Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem]]''.

<!-- Do not alter quoted text in this section. The quotations are taken directly from the referenced source and any alteration may be considered vandalism. -->Before 20th Century Fox gave ''Alien vs. Predator'' the [[greenlight]], ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'' writer/director [[James Cameron]] had been working on a story for a fifth ''Alien'' film. ''Alien'' director [[Ridley Scott]] had talked with Cameron, stating "I think it would be a lot of fun, but the most important thing is to get the story right."<ref name="Alien vs. Predator: Battle of the Sequels">{{cite web|title=''Alien'' vs. ''Predator'': Battle of the Sequels|last=Davidson|first=Paul|work=IGN|date=23 January 2002|url=http://au.movies.ign.com/articles/317/317700p1.html|accessdate=14 January 2008}}</ref> In a 2002 interview, Scott's concept for a story was "to go back to where the alien creatures were first found and explain how they were created"; this project eventually became Scott's 2012 film ''[[Prometheus (2012 film)|Prometheus]]''. On learning that Fox intended to pursue ''Alien vs. Predator'', Cameron believed the film would "kill the validity of the franchise" and ceased work on his story, "To me, that was ''[[Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man|Frankenstein Meets Werewolf]]''.

I think of the five ''Alien'' films, I'd rate it third. I actually liked it. I actually liked it a lot."<ref name="vespe"/> Conversely, Ridley Scott had no interest in the ''Alien vs. Predator'' films. When asked in May 2012 if he had watched them, Scott laughed, "No. I couldn't do that. I couldn't quite take that step."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMfvAYkXgrU|title=Ridley Scott Interview <U+2013> Prometheus|author=[[Empire (film magazine)|Empiremagazine]]|publisher=YouTube|date=30 May 2012|accessdate=3 June 2012}}</ref>

===Development===
The concept of ''Alien vs. Predator'' originated from the ''[[Aliens Versus Predator (comics)|Aliens versus Predator]]'' comic book in 1989, and was hinted at when an Alien skull appeared in a trophy case aboard the Predator ship in ''[[Predator 2]]''.<ref name="briggs">{{cite news|work=Cinescape Presents v3 #9|title=Movie Aliens}}</ref> Screenwriter [[Peter Briggs]] created the original [[Spec script|spec screenplay]] in 1990<U+2013>1991, which was based on the first comic series.<ref name="briggs"/> In 1991, he successfully pitched the concept to 20th Century Fox, who owned the film franchises, although the company did not move forward with the project until 2002. The project was delayed chiefly because 20th Century Fox was working on ''[[Alien: Resurrection]]''.<ref>{{cite news|last= |first= |title=Aliens Vs. Predator: Lost in Space?|work=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=55|publisher=EGM Media, LLC|date=February 1994|page=217}}</ref> A draft penned by James DeMonaco and Kevin Fox was rejected by producer [[John Davis (producer)|John Davis]], who hoped to give the film an original approach by setting it on Earth.<ref>{{cite web|title=''Alien vs. Predator'' Still Seeking a Script|last=Davidson|first=Paul|work=[[IGN]]|date=7 March 2002|url=http://au.movies.ign.com/articles/355/355096p1.html|accessdate=13 January 2008}}</ref>

As there were six producers between the film franchises, Davis had difficulty securing the rights as the producers were worried about a film featuring the two creatures. [[Paul W. S. Anderson]] pitched Davis a story he worked on for eight years, and showed him concept art created by [[Randy Bowen]].<ref name="AVP Commentary">{{cite video|title=Aliens vs. Predator|people=[[Paul W. S.

Salerno spent six months writing the shooting script, finished its development, and stayed on for revisions throughout the film's production.<ref>{{cite web|title=Armageddon It: Shane Salerno Speaks Out! <U+2014> Part Two|last=Seeton|first=Reg|author2=Dayna Van Buskirk|work=Screenwriting.ugo|url=http://screenwriting.ugo.com/screenwriting/shanesalerno2_interview.php |accessdate=13 January 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20040803233743/http://screenwriting.ugo.com/screenwriting/shanesalerno2_interview.php |archivedate = 3 August 2004}}</ref>

===Story and setting===
[[File:Alien vs. Predator (film) Predator gods.jpg|thumb|Influenced by the work of [[Erich von D<U+00E4>niken]] and [[Aztec mythology]], Anderson had the Predators come to Earth in spaceships and teach humans how to build pyramids. As a result they were treated as gods.|alt=]]
Early reports claimed the story was about humans who tried to lure Predators with Alien eggs, although the idea was scrapped.<ref>{{cite web|title=Anderson Will Direct ''Aliens vs. Predator''|last=Davidson|first=Paul|work=IGN|date=15 July 2002|url=http://au.movies.ign.com/articles/364/364819p1.html|accessdate=13 January 2008}}</ref> Influenced by the work of [[Erich von D<U+00E4>niken]], Anderson researched von D<U+00E4>niken's theories on how he believed early civilisations were able to construct massive pyramids with the help of aliens, an idea drawn from [[Aztec mythology]].<ref name="AVP featurette">{{cite web|title=''Aliens vs. Predator'' featurette|work=[[Apple Inc.]]|url=http://www.apple.com/trailers/fox/avp/featurette/|accessdate=13 January 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080107231134/http://www.apple.com/trailers/fox/avp/featurette/| archivedate= 7 January 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Anderson wove these ideas into ''Alien vs. Predator'', describing a scenario in which Predators taught ancient humans to build pyramids and used Earth for [[rite of passage]] rituals every 100 years in which they would hunt Aliens. To explain how these ancient civilisations "disappeared without a trace", Anderson came up with the idea that the Predators, if overwhelmed by the Aliens, would use their self-destruct weapons to kill everything in the area.<ref name="AVP featurette"/> [[H. P. Lovecraft]]'s 1931 novella ''[[At the Mountains of Madness]]'' served as an inspiration for the film, and several elements of the ''Aliens vs. Predator'' comic series were included.<ref name="AVP Commentary"/><ref>{{cite video|publisher=''20th Century Fox''|title=Alien: Definitive Edition|type = DVD}}</ref> Anderson's initial script called for five Predators to appear in the film, although the number was later reduced to three.<ref name="AVP featurette"/>

As ''Alien vs. Predator'' is a sequel to the ''Predator'' films and prequel to the ''Alien'' series, Anderson was cautious of contradicting continuity in the franchises. He chose to set the film on the remote [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[Antarctic]] island of [[Bouvet Island|Bouvet]] commenting, "It's definitely the most hostile environment on Earth and probably the closest to an Alien surface you can get."<ref name="MM">{{cite journal|title=Let's get ready to rumble!|journal=Movie Magic|date=January 2005|page=62}}</ref> Anderson thought that setting the film in an urban environment like New York City would break continuity with the ''Alien'' series as the protagonist, [[Ellen Ripley]], had no knowledge the creatures existed. "You can't have an Alien running around the city now, because it would've been written up and everyone will know about it. So there's nothing in this movie that contradicts anything that already exists."<ref name="MM"/>

===Casting===
[[File:Lance Henriksen.jpg|thumb|upright|Lance Henriksen was the first to be cast in ''Alien vs. Predator'', as Anderson wanted to keep continuity with the ''Alien'' series.|alt=]]
The first actor to be cast for ''Alien vs. Predator'' was [[Lance Henriksen]], who played the character Bishop in ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'' and ''[[Alien 3]]''. Although the ''Alien'' movies are set 150 years in the future, Anderson wanted to keep continuity with the series by including a familiar actor. Henriksen plays billionaire Charles Bishop Weyland, a character that ties in with the Weyland-Yutani Corporation. According to Anderson, Weyland becomes known for the discovery of the pyramid, and as a result the Weyland-Yutani Corporation models the Bishop android in the ''Alien'' films after him; "when the Bishop android is created in 150 years time, it's created with the face of the creator. It's kind of like [[Microsoft]] building an android in 100 years time that has the face of [[Bill Gates]]."<ref>{{cite web|title=Interview with ''AvP'' Director Paul Anderson|last=Horn|first=Steven|work=IGN|url=http://au.movies.ign.com/articles/446/446412p2.html|accessdate=15 January 2008}}</ref>

Anderson opted for a European cast including Italian actor [[Raoul Bova]], [[Ewen Bremner]] from Scotland, and English actor [[Colin Salmon]]. Producer Davis said, "There's a truly international flavor to the cast, and gives the film a lot of character."<ref name="Alien vs. Predator PN">{{cite web|title=''Alien vs. Predator'' production notes|work=AVP-movie|url=http://www.avp-movie.com/us/flash/production-notes.html |accessdate=14 January 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070624045640/http://www.avp-movie.com/us/flash/production-notes.html |archivedate = 24 June 2007}}</ref> Several hundred actresses attended the auditions to be cast as the film's heroine Alexa Woods. [[Sanaa Lathan]] was selected, and one week later she flew to Prague to begin filming. The filmmakers knew there would be comparisons to ''Alien'' heroine Ellen Ripley and did not want a clone of the character, but wanted to make her similar while adding something different.<ref name="Alien vs. Predator PN"/>

Anderson reported in an interview that California Governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] was willing to reprise his role as Major Alan "Dutch" Schaeffer from ''Predator'' in a short [[cameo appearance]] if he lost the [[California recall election, 2003|recall election]] on condition that the filming should take place at his residence.<ref>{{cite web|title=Exclusive: Paul Anderson on ''AvP''|last=Utichi|first=Joe|work=Filmfocus.co.uk|date=4 October 2004|url=http://www.filmfocus.co.uk/newsdetail.asp?NewsID=248|accessdate=16 January 2008}}</ref> Schwarzenegger, however, won the election with 48.58% of the votes and was unavailable to participate in ''Alien vs. Predator''. Actress [[Sigourney Weaver]], who starred as Ellen Ripley in the ''Alien'' series, said she was happy not to be in the film, as a possible crossover was "the reason I wanted my character to die in the first place", and thought the concept "sounded awful".<ref>{{cite web|title=Sigourney Weaver: Loving the alien |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/film-and-tv/features/sigourney-weaver-loving-the-alien-557218.html |work=The Independent |date=20 August 2004|accessdate=6 April 2014 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100724213823/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/sigourney-weaver-loving-the-alien-557218.html |archivedate=6 April 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite video|title=''From The Ashes <U+2013> Reviving The Story'', ''Alien Quadrilogy''|date=2003|publisher=''20th Century Fox''}}</ref>

===Filming and set designs===
Production began in late 2003 at [[Barrandov Studios]] in Prague, [[Czech Republic]], where most of the filming took place. [[Production designer]] Richard Bridgland was in charge of sets, props and vehicles, based on early concept art Anderson had created to give a broad direction of how things would look. 25 to 30 life-sized sets were constructed at Barrandov Studios, many of which were interiors of the pyramid. The pyramid's carvings, sculptures, and [[hieroglyphs]] were influenced by [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]], [[Cambodia]]n, and [[Aztec]] civilisations, while the regular shifting of the pyramid's rooms was meant to evoke a sense of [[claustrophobia]] similar to the original ''Alien'' film.<ref>{{cite web|title=''Alien vs. Predator'' A New World Vision|work=[[Spike (TV channel)|Spike]]|url=http://www.spike.com/video/2644628/collection/232/event/22474 |accessdate=13 June 2010 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080128202159/http://www.spike.com/video/2644628/collection/232/event/22474 |archivedate = 28 January 2008}}</ref> According to Anderson, if he was to build the sets in Los Angeles they would have cost $20 million. However, in Prague they cost $2 million, an important factor when the film's budget was less than $50 million.<ref name="AVP Commentary"/>

Third scale [[Miniature effect|miniatures]] several meters in height were created to give the film the effect of realism, rather than relying on [[computer generated imagery]] (CGI). For the whaling station miniatures and life-sized sets, over 700 bags of [[artificial snow]] were used (roughly 15<U+2013>20 tons).<ref name="AVP special features"/> A 4.5-meter miniature of an [[icebreaker]] with working lights and a mechanical moving radar was created, costing almost $37,000 and taking 10 weeks to create. Visual effects producer Arthur Windus, claimed miniatures were beneficial in the filming process: "With computer graphics, you need to spend a lot of time making it real. With a miniature, you shoot it and its there."<ref name="Local shoots shrinking">{{cite web|title=Local shoots shrinking|last=Campbell|first=Josh|work=The Prague Post|date=5 February 2004|url=http://www.praguepost.com/P03/2004/Art/0205/busiHE.php |accessdate=13 June 2010 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080329151534/http://www.praguepost.com/P03/2004/Art/0205/busiHE.php |archivedate = 29 March 2008}}</ref> A scale 25-meter miniature of the whaling station was created in several months. It was designed so the model could be collapsed and then reconstructed, which proved beneficial for a six-second shot which required a re-shoot.<ref name="Local shoots shrinking"/>

===Effects and creatures===
[[File:AVPmoviefilming.PNG|thumb|A hydraulic Alien was used to film six scenes as it was faster than a man in a suit. The puppet required six people to operate it.|alt=]]
Special effects company [[Amalgamated Dynamics]] Incorporated (ADI) was hired for the movie, having previously worked on ''[[Alien 3]]'' and ''[[Alien Resurrection]]''. Visual special effects producers Arthur Windus and [[John Bruno (special effects artist)|John Bruno]] were in charge of the project, which contained 400 effects shots.<ref name="Local shoots shrinking"/> ADI founders Alec Gillis, Tom Woodruff Jr., and members of their company, began designing costumes, miniatures and effects in June 2003. For five months the creatures were redesigned, the Predators wrist blades being extended roughly four times longer than those in the ''Predator'' films, and a larger mechanical plasma caster was created for the Scar Predator.<ref name="AVP special features"/>

The basic shape of the Predator mask was kept, although technical details were added and each Predator was given a unique mask to distinguish them from each other. These masks were created using clay, which was used to form moulds to create [[fiberglass]] copies. These copies were painted to give a weathered look, which Woodruff claims "is what the Predator is all about".<ref name="AVP special features"/> A [[Hydraulic drive system|hydraulic]] Alien puppet was created so ADI would be able to make movements faster and give the Alien a "slimline and skeletal" appearance, rather than using an actor in a suit. The puppet required six people to run it; one for the head and body, two for the arms, and a sixth to make sure the signals were reaching the computer. Movements were recorded in the computer so that puppeteers would be able to repeat moves that Anderson liked. The puppet was used in six shots, including the fight scene with the Predator which took one month to film.<ref name="AVP special features"/>

The crew tried to keep CGI use to a minimum, as Anderson said people in suits and puppets are scarier than CGI monsters as they are "there in the frame".<ref name="AVP special features"/> Roughly 70% of scenes were created using suits, puppets, and miniatures. The Alien queen was filmed using three variations: a 4.8-meter practical version, a 1.2-meter puppet, and a computer-generated version. The practical version required 12 puppeteers to operate,<ref name="AVP Commentary"/> and CGI tails were added to the Aliens and the queen as they were difficult to animate using puppetry.<ref name="Alien vs. Predator PN"/><ref>{{cite video|title=Alien vs. Predator|people=Alec Gillis, Tom Woodruff and John Bruno|date=2004|publisher=''20th Century Fox''}}</ref> The queen alien's inner-mouth was automated though, and was powered by a system of hydraulics. Anderson praised ''Alien'' director [[Ridley Scott]]'s and ''Predator'' director [[John McTiernan]]'s abilities at building suspense by not showing the creatures until late in the film, something Anderson wanted to accomplish with ''Alien vs. Predator''. "Yes, we make you wait 45 minutes, but once it goes off, from there until the end of the movie, it's fucking relentless".<ref>{{cite journal|last=Salisbury|first=Mark|title=The ''AVP'' referee|journal=[[Fangoria]]|issue=#235|page=44}}</ref>

===Music===
{{Main|Alien vs. Predator (soundtrack)}}
Austrian composer [[Harald Kloser]] was hired to create the [[Film score|film's score]]. After completing the score for ''[[The Day After Tomorrow]]'', Kloser was chosen by Anderson as he is a fan of the franchises.<ref name="IGN FilmForce Exclusive: Interview with AVP Director Paul Anderson">{{cite web|title=IGN FilmForce Exclusive: Interview with AVP Director Paul Anderson|last=Horn|first=Steven|work=IGN|url=http://au.movies.ign.com/articles/500/500573p3.html|accessdate=20 January 2008}}</ref> It was recorded in London, and was primarily [[orchestral]] as Anderson commented, "this is a terrifying movie and it needs a terrifying, classic movie score to go with it; at the same time it's got huge action so it needs that kind of proper orchestral support."<ref name="IGN FilmForce Exclusive: Interview with AVP Director Paul Anderson"/>

The score was released on 31 August 2004, and received mixed reviews. James Christopher Monger of [[Allmusic]] thought Kloser introduced electronic elements well, and called "Alien vs. Predator Main Theme a particularly striking and serves as a continuous creative source for the composer to dip his baton in."<ref>{{cite web|title=''Alien vs. Predator'' Original Score|last=Christopher Monger|first=James|work=[[Allmusic]]|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r707665|pure_url=yes}}|accessdate=20 January 2008}}</ref> Mike Brennan of Soundtrack, however, said it "lacks the ingenuity of the previous trilogy and the ''Predator'' scores, which all shared a strong sense of rhythm in place of thematic content.

A two-disc "Extreme Edition" was released on 7 March 2005, featuring [[Making-of|behind the scenes]] footage of the conception, [[pre-production]], production, [[post-production]], and licensing of the film.

Puccio of DVD Town remarked that the extra footage contained "a few more shots of blood, gore, guts, and slime to spice things up...and tiny bits of connecting matter to help us follow the story line better, but none of it amounts to much."<ref>{{cite web |title=''AVP: Alien Vs.
