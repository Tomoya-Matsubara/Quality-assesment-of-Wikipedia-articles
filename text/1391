'''HMS ''Princess Irene''''' was a 5,394 GRT [[ocean liner]] which was built in 1914 by [[William Denny and Brothers|William Denny and Brothers Ltd]], [[Dumbarton]], [[Scotland]] for the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]]. She was requisitioned by the [[Royal Navy]] on completion and converted to an auxiliary [[minelayer]]. On 27 May 1915, she exploded and sank off [[Sheerness]], [[Kent]] with the loss of 352 lives.

==Description==
''Princess Irene'' was {{convert|395|ft|m}} long. She had a beam of {{convert|54|ft|m}} and a draught of {{convert|17|ft|m}}. She was propelled by four [[steam turbines]] which were built by Denny's and could propel the ship at {{convert|22.5|kn|km/h}}.<ref name=Clydesite>{{cite web |url=http://www.clydesite.co.uk/clydebuilt/viewship.asp?id=11317 |title=Launched 1914: TS PRINCESS IRENE |publisher=Clydesite |accessdate=21 May 2011}}</ref>

===Loss===
In May 1915, ''Princess Irene'' was moored in Saltpan Reach, on the [[River Medway|Medway Estuary]] in [[Kent]] between [[Port Victoria, Kent|Port Victoria]] and [[Sheerness]], being loaded with [[naval mine|mines]] in preparation for deployment on a minelaying mission. At 11:14 [[GMT]] on 27 May, ''Princess Irene'' exploded and disintegrated. A column of flame {{convert|300|ft|m}} high was followed a few seconds later by another of similar height and a pall of smoke hung over the spot where ''Princess Irene'' had been,<ref name=Times280515a>{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Flames 300 feet high |day_of_week=Friday |date=28 May 1915 |page_number=8 |issue=40866 |column=E }}</ref> reaching to {{convert|1200|ft|m}}.{{sfn|Ingleton|2010|p=51}} Two barges laying alongside her were also destroyed.<ref name=Times280515c/> The explosion was larger than that which had destroyed {{HMS|Bulwark|1899|6}} six months earlier, although the loss of life was less. A total of 352 people were killed,{{sfn|Ingleton|2010|p=50}} including 273 officers and men, and 76 dockyard workers who were on board ''Princess Irene''. On the [[Isle of Grain]] a girl of nine was killed by flying d<U+00E9>bris, and a farmhand died of [[shock (circulatory)|shock]].{{sfn|Ingleton|2010|p=50}} A [[collier (ship type)|collier]] half a mile (800 m) away had its crane blown off its mountings. A part of one of ''Princess Irene'''s boilers landed on the ship; a man working on the ship died from injuries sustained when he was struck by a piece of metal weighing {{convert|70|lb|kg}}.{{sfn|Ingleton|2010|p=50}}<ref name=Times280515a/><ref name=Times290515>{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=The Princess Irene |day_of_week=Saturday |date=29 May 1915 |page_number=3 |issue=40867 |column=F }}</ref><ref name=Times010615>{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Princess Irene disaster |day_of_week=Tuesday |date=1 June 1915 |page_number=5 |issue=40869 |column=F }}</ref>

Wreckage was flung up to {{convert|20|mi|km}} away, with people near [[Sittingbourne]] being injured by flying d<U+00E9>bris,<ref name=Times280515c/> some of which landed in [[Bredhurst]].<ref name=GWPDA/> Severed heads were found at [[Hartlip]] and on the Isle of Grain. A case of [[butter]] landed at [[Rainham, Kent|Rainham]], {{convert|6|mi|km}} away.{{sfn|Ingleton|2010|p=51}} A 10 ton (10,160&nbsp;kg) section of the ship landed on the Isle of Grain. The [[Admiralty|Admiralty's]] oil storage tanks there were damaged. The sole survivor from ''Princes Irene'' was a stoker, who suffered severe burns.{{sfn|Ingleton|2010|p=50}} Three of her crew had a lucky escape as they were ashore at the time.<ref name=Times280515b>{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Princess Irene blown up |day_of_week=Friday |date=28 May 1915 |page_number=8 |issue=40866 |column=E }}</ref>

The victims whose bodies were recovered were buried at Woodlands Road Cemetery, [[Gillingham, Kent|Gillingham]].<ref name=GWPDA/> A memorial service for the victims was held at the Dockyard Church, Sheerness on 1 June 1915. It was led by [[Randall Davidson, 1st Baron Davidson of Lambeth|Randall Davidson]], the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]].<ref name=Times310515>{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=The Princess Irene |day_of_week=Monday |date=31 May 1915 |page_number=3 |issue=40868 |column=B }}</ref> [[Inquest]]s were held on two victims of the disaster.<ref name=Times010615/> The [[coroner]] stated that he did not intend to hold an inquest for any other victim unless there were exceptional circumstances that warranted it.<ref name=Times150615>{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Loss of the Princess Irene |day_of_week=Tuesday |date=15 June 1915 |page_number=8 |issue=40881 |column=B }}</ref>

A Court of Inquiry<!--do not wikilink, leads to US Naval Board of Inquiry--> was held into the loss of ''Princess Irene''. Evidence was given that priming of the mines was being carried out hurriedly and by untrained personnel. A faulty primer was blamed for the explosion.<ref name=GWPDA/> Following the loss of {{HMS|Natal|1905|6}} on 30 December 1915 and {{HMS|Vanguard|1909|6}} on 9 July 1917, both caused by internal explosions, suspicion was raised at the inquiry into the loss of ''Natal'' that [[sabotage]] was to blame for the loss of all four ships. A worker at [[Chatham Dockyard]] was named as a suspect. A thorough investigation by [[Special Branch#United Kingdom|Special Branch]] cleared him of any blame.{{sfn|Ingleton|2010|p=51}}
