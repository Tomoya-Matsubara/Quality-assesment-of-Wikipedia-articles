'''''Myotis alcathoe''''' is a European bat in the genus ''[[Myotis]]''. Known only from Greece and Hungary when it was first described in 2001, its known distribution has since expanded to Spain, England, Sweden, and Azerbaijan, among other countries. It is similar to the [[whiskered bat]] (''Myotis mystacinus'') and other species and is difficult to distinguish from them. However, its brown fur is distinctive and it is clearly different in characters of its [[karyotype]] and [[DNA sequence]]s. Although some genetic data suggest that it is related to [[Geoffroy's bat]] (''Myotis emarginatus''), other analyses do not support a close relationship between ''M.&nbsp;alcathoe'' and any other species.

With a forearm length of 30.8 to 34.6&nbsp;mm (1.2 to 1.4&nbsp;in) and body mass of 3.5 to 5.5&nbsp;g (0.1 to 0.2&nbsp;oz), ''Myotis alcathoe'' is a small bat. The fur is usually reddish-brown on the upperparts and brown below, but more grayish in juveniles. The [[tragus (anatomy)|tragus]] (a projection on the inner side of the ear) is short, as is the ear itself, and the inner side of the ear is pale at the base. The wings are brown and the [[baculum]] (penis bone) is short and broad. ''M.&nbsp;alcathoe'' has a very high-pitched [[animal echolocation|echolocation]] call, with a frequency that falls from 120&nbsp;[[kilohertz|kHz]] at the beginning of the call to about 43&nbsp;kHz at the end.

Usually found in [[old-growth forest|old-growth]] [[deciduous forest]] near water, ''Myotis alcathoe'' forages high in the [[canopy (biology)|canopy]] and above water and mostly eats flies. The animal roosts in cavities high in trees. Although there are some winter records from caves, it may also spend the winter in tree cavities. Several [[parasite]]s have been recorded on ''M.&nbsp;alcathoe''. The [[IUCN Red List]] assesses ''Myotis alcathoe'' as "[[Data Deficient]]", but it is considered threatened in several areas because of its rarity and vulnerability to [[habitat loss]].

==Taxonomy==
The [[whiskered bat]] (''Myotis mystacinus'') and similar species in Eurasia (collectively known as "whiskered bats") are difficult to distinguish from each other; for example, the distantly related [[Brandt's bat]] (''Myotis brandtii'') was not recognized as distinct from ''M.&nbsp;mystacinus'' until the 1970s.<ref name=Nea362>Niermann et al., 2007, p. 362</ref> Small, unusual ''M.&nbsp;mystacinus''-like bats were first recorded in Greece in the 1970s, but it was not until the advent of genetic studies that these bats could be confirmed as representing a distinct species, named ''Myotis alcathoe''.<ref name=Dea230/> In 2001, the species was described by German zoologists Otto von Helversen and Klaus-Gerhard Heller on the basis of specimens from Greece and Hungary.<ref>von Helversen et al., 2001, p. 217; Voigt et al., 2009<!--full first names for Helversen and Heller--></ref> Although it also differs from other whiskered bats by [[morphology (anatomy)|morphological]] characters, ''Myotis alcathoe'' is most clearly distinct in its genetics, including [[DNA sequence]]s and the location of the [[nucleolus organizer region]]s.<ref name=Hea218>von Helversen et al., 2001, p. 218</ref>

Von Helversen and Heller argued that none of the old names now considered [[synonym (taxonomy)|synonyms]] of ''M.&nbsp;mystacinus'' could apply to ''M.&nbsp;alcathoe'', because these names all have their [[type locality (biology)|type localities]] in western or central Europe.<ref name=Hea218/> However, the more recent discovery of ''M.&nbsp;alcathoe'' further to the west renders it possible that an older name may be discovered.<ref>Ruedi et al., 2002, p. 648; Benda et al., 2003a, p. 364</ref> In addition, Russian researcher Suren Gazaryan has suggested that the name ''caucasicus'' Tsytsulina, 2000 (originally proposed for a [[subspecies]] of ''M.&nbsp;mystacinus'' from the Caucasus) may prove to be applicable to ''M. alcathoe''; in that case, the species would be renamed ''Myotis caucasicus''.<ref name=G60/> The species may have remained undetected in Germany for so long because bat researchers did not sample its preferred habitats and would dismiss unusual-looking whiskered bats as being abnormal ''M.&nbsp;mystacinus'' or ''M.&nbsp;brandtii''.<ref name=OF111/>

On the basis of [[mitochondrial DNA]] sequence analysis, ''Myotis alcathoe'' was at first thought to be most closely related to [[Geoffroy's bat]] (''Myotis emarginatus'') of southern Europe, North Africa, and southwestern Asia.<ref>von Helversen et al., 2001, fig. 2; Mayer et al., 2007, fig. 1</ref> However, a study of the mitochondrial [[cytochrome b|cytochrome ''b'']] gene incorporating many ''Myotis'' species did not support this relationship, and could not place ''M.&nbsp;alcathoe'' securely at a specific position among Eurasian ''Myotis''.<ref>Stadelmann et al., 2004, pp. 187<U+2013>188</ref> Two groups with slightly divergent mitochondrial DNA sequences (separated by 1.3 to 1.4% sequence divergence) are distinguishable within the species, which probably correspond to different [[Refugium (population biology)|glacial refugia]] where ''M.&nbsp;alcathoe'' populations survived the [[last glacial period]]. One, known as the "Hungarian" group, has been recorded from Spain, France, Austria, Hungary, and Slovakia, and probably corresponds to a refugium in Iberia; the other, the "Greek" group, is known only from Greece and Slovakia.<ref name=Sea7>Spitzenberger et al., 2008, p. 7</ref>

The [[specific name]], ''alcathoe'', refers to [[Alcathoe]], a figure from [[Greek mythology]] who was turned into a bat when she refused the advances of the god [[Dionysus]]. She was associated with gorges and small streams, the preferred habitat of ''Myotis alcathoe'' in Greece.<ref name=Hea217>von Helversen et al., 2001, p. 217</ref> In their original description, von Helversen and colleagues described her as a [[nymph]],<ref name=Hea217/> and the [[common name]] "nymph bat" has therefore been used for this species.<ref>Dietz and von Helversen, 2004, p. 71; Benda, 2008, p. 107</ref> However, none of the classical sources speak of Alcathoe as a nymph; instead, she was a princess, the daughter of King [[Minyas (mythology)|Minyas]] of [[Orchomenus (Boeotia)|Orchomenos]]. Therefore, Petr Benda recommended in 2008 that the common name "Alcathoe bat" or "Alcathoe myotis" be used instead.<ref>Benda, 2008, p. 107</ref> Other common names include "Alcathoe's bat"<ref>Dietz and von Helversen, 2004, p. 71</ref> and "Alcathoe whiskered bat".<ref name=iucn/>

==Description==
[[File:Myotis mystacinus from Carinthia2.jpg|thumb|The [[whiskered bat]] (''Myotis mystacinus'') is very similar to ''Myotis alcathoe''.]]
''Myotis alcathoe'' is the smallest European ''Myotis'' species. The fur is brownish on the upperparts, with a reddish tone in old specimens, and a slightly paler gray-brown below.<ref name=Dea230/> Younger animals may be completely gray-brown.<ref>von Helversen et al., 2001, p. 218; Dietz and von Helversen, 2004, p. 42; Agirre-Mendi et al., 2004, pp. 53<U+2013>54</ref> The brown fur distinguishes adult ''M.&nbsp;alcathoe'' from other whiskered bats, but juveniles cannot be unambiguously identified on the basis of morphology.<ref name=Sea9>Spitzenberger et al., 2008, p. 9</ref> ''M.&nbsp;alcathoe'' is similar to [[Daubenton's bat]] (''Myotis daubentonii'') and ''M.&nbsp;emarginatus'' in color.<ref name=Bea362>Benda et al., 2003a, p. 362</ref> On the upper side of the body, the hairs are 6 to 8&nbsp;mm long and have dark bases and brown tips. The hairs on the lower side of the body are only slightly paler at the tip than at the base.<ref name=Hea218/>

The face and the upper lips are reddish to pink.<ref name=DH42/> Although most of the face is hairy, the area around the eyes is bare.<ref name=Rea647/> The nostrils are heart-shaped,<ref name=DH42>Dietz and von Helversen, 2004, p. 42</ref> and their back end is broad, as in ''M.&nbsp;brandtii'', not narrow as in ''M.&nbsp;mystacinus''.<ref name=H1161>von Helversen, 2001, p. 1161</ref> Several [[gland]]s are present on the muzzle, most prominently in reproductively active males. The ears are brown and are lighter on the inside than the outside. There is a notch at the edge of the ear, and the pointed [[tragus (anatomy)|tragus]] (a projection inside the ear that is present in some bats) extends up to this notch.<ref name=Hea218/> The base of the inner side of the ear is white; it is much darker in ''M.&nbsp;mystacinus''.<ref>Alcalde, 2010, p. 232; Agirre-Mendi et al., 2004, p. 54; Ruedi et al., 2002, p. 647</ref> The feet and the thumbs are very small. The small size of the ear, tragus, feet, and thumb distinguishes ''M.&nbsp;alcathoe'' from the slightly larger ''M.&nbsp;mystacinus'' and ''M.&nbsp;brandtii'',<ref name=Hea218/> but the feet are relatively larger than in ''M.&nbsp;mystacinus''.<ref name=Rea647>Ruedi et al., 2002, p. 647</ref>

The wings are brown, but lighter than those of ''M.&nbsp;mystacinus''.<ref name=H1162>von Helversen, 2004, p. 1162</ref> The [[plagiopatagium]] (the portion of the wing between the last digit and the hindlegs) is attached to the fifth toe. The tail extends only about 1&nbsp;mm beyond the back margin of the [[uropatagium]] (the portion of the wing membrane between the hindlegs). The [[calcar]], a cartilaginous spur supporting the uropatagium, is slender. With a width around 1.3&nbsp;mm, the penis is narrow, and it lacks a broadened tip. The [[baculum]] (penis bone) is about 0.5&nbsp;mm long.<ref name=Hea218/> The short and broad shape of this bone distinguishes ''M.&nbsp;alcathoe'' from ''M.&nbsp;brandtii'' as well as ''[[Myotis ikonnikovi|M.&nbsp;ikonnikovi]]''.<ref>von Helversen, 2004, p. 1161; von Helversen et al., 2001, p. 218</ref>

The skull is similar in shape to that of ''M.&nbsp;mystacinus'' and ''M.&nbsp;brandtii'', but the front part of the [[braincase]] is higher. The second and third upper premolars (P2 and P3) are tiny and pressed against the upper canine (C1) and fourth premolar (P4).<ref name=Hea218/> The canine is less well-developed than in ''M.&nbsp;mystacinus''.<ref name=Sea9/> There is a clear [[cusp (dentistry)|cusp]] present on the side of the P4. The accessory cusp known as the [[protoconule]] is present on each of the upper molars when they are unworn. ''M.&nbsp;mystacinus'' lacks the P4 cusp and the protoconules on the molars.<ref name=Hea218/>

As usual in ''Myotis'' species, ''Myotis alcathoe'' has a [[karyotype]] consisting of 44 [[chromosome]]s, with the [[fundamental number]] of chromosomal arms equal to 52. However, a 1987 study already found that ''M.&nbsp;alcathoe'' (then called "''Myotis'' sp. B") differs from both ''M.&nbsp;mystacinus'' and ''M.&nbsp;brandtii'' in the pattern of active nucleolus organizer regions on the chromosomes.<ref name=Hea218/> ''M.&nbsp;alcathoe'' also differs from other ''Myotis'' species in the sequences of the mitochondrial genes [[12S rRNA]] and [[NADH dehydrogenase]] subunit 1 by at least 5% and 13%, respectively.<ref>von Helversen et al., 2001, pp. 219<U+2013>220</ref>

''Myotis alcathoe'' has the highest-frequency [[animal echolocation|echolocation]] call of any European ''Myotis''. In open terrain, the call has an average duration of 2.5&nbsp;[[millisecond|ms]], but it may be up to 4&nbsp;ms long. At the beginning, its frequency is around 120&nbsp;[[kilohertz|kHz]], but it then falls fast, subsequently falls slightly slower, and at the end falls faster again. The call reaches its highest amplitude at around 53&nbsp;kHz.<ref>von Helversen et al., 2001, pp. 221<U+2013>222</ref> It terminates at around 43 to 46&nbsp;kHz; this characteristic is especially distinctive.<ref name=Dea231>Dietz et al., 2007, p. 231</ref> In different experiments, the time between calls was found to be around 85 and 66&nbsp;ms, respectively.<ref name=H1167>von Helversen, 2004, p. 1167</ref> The high-pitched call may be an adaptation to the animal's occurrence in dense vegetation.<ref name=OF109>Ohlendorf and Funkel, 2008, p. 109</ref>

Head and body length is about 4&nbsp;cm (2&nbsp;in) and wingspan is around 20&nbsp;cm (8&nbsp;in).<ref>von Helversen, pers. comm. in Skiba, 2003, p. 107</ref> Forearm length is 30.8 to 34.6&nbsp;mm (1.2 to 1.4&nbsp;in), [[tibia]] length is 13.5 to 15.9&nbsp;mm (0.5 to 0.6&nbsp;in), hindfoot length is 5.1 to 5.8&nbsp;mm (0.2 to 0.2&nbsp;in), and body mass is 3.5 to 5.5&nbsp;g (0.1 to 0.2&nbsp;oz).<ref name=Dea230>Dietz et al., 2007, p. 230</ref>

==Distribution and habitat==
Although ''Myotis alcathoe'' was initially known only from Greece and Hungary and was thought to be restricted to southeastern Europe, records since then have greatly expanded its range, and it is now known from Spain and England to Sweden and European Turkey.<ref>Niermann et al., 2007, p. 365; Jan et al., 2010; Ahl<U+00E9>n, 2010</ref> In several European countries, focused searches were conducted to detect its occurrence.<ref>Ohlendorf and Hoffmann, 2009, p. 112; Lu<U+010D>an et al., 2009, p. 62</ref> Its habitat generally consists of moist, deciduous, mature forest near streams, for example in ravines or in [[alluvial forest]] (forest near a river).<ref name=Nea365/> In Germany, its preferred habitat consists of mixed deciduous forest.<ref name=OF112/> In the south of the continent, it usually occurs in mountain ranges, but the factors affecting its distribution in the north are less well known. Its range appears to be similar in shape to those of the [[greater horseshoe bat|greater]] and [[lesser horseshoe bat]]s (''Rhinolophus ferrumequinum'' and ''R. hipposideros'') and ''Myotis emarginatus''.<ref name=Nea365>Niermann et al., 2007, p. 365</ref> It may yet be found in other European countries, such as the [[Benelux]] countries, Ireland, and Moldova.<ref>Niermann et al., 2007, p. 365; Dietz et al., 2007, pp. 231, 233; Jan et al., 2010, p. 471</ref> Although there are abundant records from some areas, such as France and Hungary, the species appears to be rare in most of its range.<ref name=Sea11>Spitzenberger et al., 2008, p. 11</ref>

Known records are as follows:
;Albania: A single specimen was caught in 2006 in a forest of planes (''[[Platanus orientalis]]'') and poplars (''[[Populus]]'' spp.) next to a small stream. ''M.&nbsp;mystacinus'' was recorded at the same place.<ref>Niermann et al., 2007, pp. 362<U+2013>363</ref>
;Austria: Three specimens of ''Myotis alcathoe'' were caught in [[Burgenland]], southeastern Austria, in 2006.<ref>Spitzenberger et al., 2008, p. 3</ref> They were caught near fishponds in a region dominated by oak (''[[Quercus petraea]]'') and hornbeam (''[[Carpinus betulus]]'').<ref>Spitzenberger et al., 2008, pp. 4<U+2013>6</ref>
;Azerbaijan: The species was recorded around 2009.<ref>Rakhmatulina, 2010, p. 1</ref>
;Bulgaria: The species is known from six localities in the south and west<!--text of Niermann et al. (2007) says southern and eastern, but map on same page clearly shows that the sites are in the south and west--> of the country;<ref name=Nea363/> the first record dates from 2003.<ref>Schunger et al., 2004, p. 325</ref> Habitats include river and mountain forests.<ref name=Nea363>Niermann et al., 2007, p. 363</ref>
;Caucasus: Bats collected in the Russian part of the [[Caucasus]] and in [[Abkhazia]] (a breakaway part of Georgia) from 2003 to 2009<ref name=G51>Gazaryan, 2009, p. 51</ref> may represent ''Myotis alcathoe''. They are small and [[morphometrics|morphometrically]] distinct from other local ''Myotis mystacinus''-like bats.<ref name=G60>Gazaryan, 2009, p. 60</ref> However, the identity of these bats has not been confirmed molecularly.<ref name=G61>Gazaryan, 2009, p. 61</ref>
;Croatia: In 2003, ''Myotis alcathoe'' was recorded here on the basis of two specimens.<ref name=CNHM2>Croatian Natural History Museum, 2005, p. 2</ref>
;Czech Republic: Here, the species was recorded at nine sites clustered in three regions, with the first record dating from 2001,<ref name=Lea64>Lu<U+010D>an et al., 2009, p. 64</ref> in addition to records from roadkilled specimens at three further sites.<ref><U+0158>eh<U+00E1>k et al., 2008</ref> The typical habitat was mature oak-hornbeam forest near water with dead, decaying trees,<ref name=Lea69/> at altitudes ranging from 170 to 390&nbsp;m (558 to 1280&nbsp;ft).<ref>Lu<U+010D>an et al., 2009, table 1; <U+0158>eh<U+00E1>k et al., 2008, pp. 465<U+2013>466</ref> Both ''M.&nbsp;mystacinus'' and ''M.&nbsp;brandtii'' occur in some of the same places in this country.<ref name=Lea69>Lu<U+010D>an et al., 2009, p. 69</ref> ''M.&nbsp;alcathoe'' has a limited, patchy distribution within the country, but reaches a high abundance in suitable habitat.<ref name=Lea68/>
;France: ''Myotis alcathoe'' was informally recognized in France in 2000 as a small ''Myotis'' similar to ''Myotis mystacinus'', the "Murin cantalou"; in 2002, it was realized that this bat represents ''Myotis alcathoe''.<ref>Ruedi et al., 2002, p. 645</ref> A large number of sites are known, mostly in the north of the country. The species reaches altitudes of up to 2000&nbsp;m (6562&nbsp;ft). It is usually found close to water, but it has been found in a variety of habitats, including farmlands, swamps, forests, and wooden grounds. In late summer and autumn, it occurs in caves.<ref name=Nea363/>
;Germany: The species is known from two different areas in the country. In 2005 and 2006, specimens were caught in an old moist forest near the Rhine in western [[Baden-W<U+00FC>rttemberg]]. Two other bats were found in highway tunnels close to this site.<ref>Brinkmann and Niermann, 2007, p. 197</ref> The species is also known from the [[Kyffh<U+00E4>user]] hill range of [[Thuringia]] in central Germany, an island of relatively warm habitat with some unusual wildlife. There, bats were caught near a spring in a [[karst]] landscape amid oak-dominated deciduous forest.<ref>Sauerbier et al., 2006; Niermann et al., 2007, p. 364; Schorcht et al., 2009</ref> The species was also recorded in deciduous forest at a former Soviet military training site in eastern Thuringia.<ref>Pr<U+00FC>ger and Bergner, 2008, p. 115</ref> ''Myotis alcathoe'' has also been recorded in the nearby states of [[Saxony-Anhalt]] and [[Saxony]], where it occurs in mixed deciduous forest. Many Saxony-Anhalt records are from near water.<ref>Ohlendorf et al., 2008; Ohlendorf, 2009a, pp. 45<U+2013>46</ref> However, the species was also recorded in the center of the city of [[Chemnitz]] in Saxony.<ref>Ohlendorf et al., 2008, p. 115</ref>
;Greece: The species has been recorded in the [[Pindus Mountains|Pindus]] and [[Rhodopi Mountains]] of central and northern Greece. Here, ''Myotis alcathoe'' is usually found in stands of [[Platanus|plane]] or [[alder]] trees next to small streams in ravines. The bat hunts close to the trees, within the stand. It is often found together with the [[lesser horseshoe bat]] (''Rhinolophus hipposideros'') and with ''M.&nbsp;mystacinus''<!--= aurascens?-->.<ref name=Hea221>von Helversen et al., 2001, p. 221</ref>
;Hungary: ''Myotis alcathoe'' is not uncommon in the mountain forests of northeastern Hungary. It has been found at brooks and lakes in oak, beech, alder, and [[hornbeam]] (''Carpinetum'') forests at 230 to 670&nbsp;m (750 to 2200&nbsp;ft) altitude. Both ''M.&nbsp;brandtii'' and ''M.&nbsp;mystacinus'' occur together with ''M.&nbsp;alcathoe'' there.<ref name=Nea364>Niermann et al., 2007, p. 364</ref>
;Italy: ''Myotis alcathoe'' has been recorded in beech forest in [[Majella National Park]] in the region of [[Abruzzo]].<ref>Parco Nazionale della Majella, 2008</ref> Additional specimens of ''Myotis alcathoe'' have been identified in Italy using molecular methods.<ref>Galimberti et al., 2010</ref>
;Latvia: A small ''Myotis'' was captured at a cave in Latvia between 2007 and 2010; pending genetic testing, it is suspected to be ''M.&nbsp;alcathoe''.<ref>Ministry of Environment of the Republic of Latvia, 2010</ref>
;Poland: The species was recorded in four caves in southern Poland in 2005 and 2006, at 770 to 1294&nbsp;m (2526 to 4245&nbsp;ft) altitude. Most caves were surrounded by beech forest (''[[Fagus sylvatica]]''), and one was surrounded by fir (''[[Abies alba]]'') and dwarf pine (''[[Pinus mugo]]'').<ref name=Nea364/>
;Romania: A single ''Myotis alcathoe'' was captured in 2007 in a nature reserve in the eastern Carpathians; the reserve contains riverine and conifer forest.<ref>J<U+00E9>re and D<U+00F3>czy, 2007, p. 179</ref> The species was additionally recorded in a forested valley containing a small stream in [[Alba County]].<ref name=OH112>Ohlendorf and Hoffmann, 2009, p. 112</ref>
;Serbia: The species was reported on the basis of three specimens shortly before 2009<!--2009 report says "recently"-->, but is probably rare.<ref>Ministry of Environment and Spatial Planning, Republic of Serbia, 2010, p. 4</ref>
;Slovakia: Here, ''Myotis alcathoe'' is known from a single site, a cave in old deciduous forest at 525&nbsp;m (1722&nbsp;ft) altitude.<ref>Benda et al., 2003a, pp. 360<U+2013>361</ref>
;Slovenia: A single specimen was recorded in Slovenia in 2007.<ref>Presetnik et al., 2007, p. 99</ref>
;Spain: In [[Catalonia]], the species is known from six sites,<ref>Flaquer et al., 2010, table 1</ref> ranging from sea level to 1200&nbsp;m (3900&nbsp;ft) altitude. It is known in beech and riverine forest and was first recorded in 2006.<ref>Flaquer et al., 2010, p. 41</ref> The species is known from three sites in [[La Rioja (Spain)|La Rioja]], where it was recorded in 2004, and occurs amidst beech and riverine forest at 790 to 1390&nbsp;m (2590 to 4560&nbsp;ft) altitude.<ref>Agirre-Mendi et al., 2004, p. 54</ref> It has also been found at seven localities in [[Navarre]], with the first record dating from 2004. There, it occurs in beech and oak forest at altitudes from 140 to 980&nbsp;m (460 to 3220&nbsp;ft).<ref>Alcalde, 2010, pp. 227<U+2013>229</ref> A single locality is known in [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]].<ref>Arz<U+00FA>a et al., undated</ref>
;Sweden: The species was recorded at five sites in the south of the country, starting in 2008, on the basis of echolocation calls.<ref>Ahl<U+00E9>n, 2010</ref>
;Switzerland: ''Myotis alcathoe'' has been recorded from the [[Col du Marchairuz]] in the [[Jura Mountains]] (canton of [[Vaud]]).<ref>Stadelmann et al., 2004, table 1, p. 187; von Helversen, 2004, p. 1164</ref>
;Turkey: Eight individuals have been caught at three sites in close vicinity in the European part of the country<ref name=Nea364/> in 2006.<ref>Niermann et al., 2007, pp. 371<U+2013>372</ref>
;United Kingdom: ''Myotis alcathoe'' has been recorded in England since 2003, and is known from two [[swarming]] sites in the south and a third site in the north of the country.<ref name=Jea471>Jan et al., 2010, p. 471</ref> The northern England site, in [[Ryedale]], is in a [[protected area]] with many old trees, and the southern sites (in [[Sussex]]) are in woodland.<ref name=Jea476>Jan et al., 2010, p. 476</ref>
The species is also known from Montenegro and possibly from Bosnia and Herzegovina.<ref name=iucn/> Early records of ''Myotis ikonnikovi''<U+2014>now known to be an eastern Asian species<U+2014>from Ukraine, Bulgaria, and Romania may also pertain to this species.<ref name=Hea221/> Because whiskered bats in many cases cannot easily be distinguished from each other without the use of genetic methods, some listings do not differentiate between them; records of ''Myotis alcathoe'' and/or ''M.&nbsp;mystacinus'' and/or (in some cases) ''M.&nbsp;brandtii'' have been reported from Bulgaria,<ref>Benda et al., 2003b, pp. 288<U+2013>290</ref> Belgium,<ref>Kervyn et al., 2009</ref> Ukraine,<ref>Zagorodniuk and Dykyy, 2009</ref> and Montenegro.<ref>Benda, 2004, p. 14</ref>

==Ecology and behavior==
''Myotis alcathoe'' is a rare species with narrow ecological requirements.<ref name=BN199>Brinkmann and Niermann, 2007, p. 199</ref> According to a study in the Czech Republic, the diet of ''Myotis alcathoe'' mostly consists of [[nematocera]]n flies, but [[caddisflies]], [[spider]]s, small [[lepidoptera]]ns, and [[neuroptera]]ns are also taken.<ref name=Lea66>Lu<U+010D>an et al., 2009, p. 66</ref> 
The presence of spiders in the diet suggests that the species gleans prey from foliage. It forages mainly high in the canopy and over water,<ref name=Lea68>Lu<U+010D>an et al., 2009, p. 68</ref> and is often found in dense vegetation.<ref name=H1164>von Helversen, 2004, p. 1164</ref> The parasitic mite ''[[Spinturnix mystacina]]'' has been found on ''M.&nbsp;alcathoe'', and the mites on ''M.&nbsp;alcathoe'', ''M.&nbsp;brandtii'', and ''M.&nbsp;mystacinus'' are genetically closely related.<ref>Bruyndonckx et al., 2009, table 1, fig. 2</ref> The [[bat fly]] ''[[Basilia mongolensis nudior]]'' has been recorded on ''M.&nbsp;alcathoe'' in Thuringia.<ref>Heddergott, 2009</ref> When caught, individuals of ''Myotis alcathoe'' are much calmer than ''M.&nbsp;mystacinus'' or ''M.&nbsp;brandtii''.<ref>Ohlendorf and Funkel, 2008, pp. 109<U+2013>110</ref>

''Myotis alcathoe'' lives in small groups.<ref name=O46>Ohlendorf, 2009a, p. 46</ref> In Greece, a maternity colony, containing three females and two juveniles, has been found in a plane tree.<ref name=Hea221/> Additional roosts were found high in oak trees in Baden-W<U+00FC>rttemberg<ref name=O46/> and Saxony-Anhalt.<ref name=OF112>Ohlendorf and Funkel, 2008, p. 112</ref> Twenty-seven roosting sites have been found in the Czech Republic, all but one in trees (the last was in a concrete pole). Most of the tree roosts were in oaks (''[[Quercus robur]]''); others were in limes (''[[Tilia cordata]]''), birches (''[[Betula pendula]]''), and various other species.<ref name=Lea65>Lu<U+010D>an et al., 2009, p. 65</ref> Roosts tend to be located high in the canopy,<ref name=Lea67/> and are often in old trees.<ref>Brinkmann and Niermann, 2007, p. 206</ref> In summer, roosts may contain large groups of up to 80 individuals, but autumn roosts in the Czech Republic are occupied by smaller groups.<ref name=Lea67>Lu<U+010D>an et al., 2009, p. 67</ref>

In Saxony-Anhalt, the species forages deep in valleys when temperatures are above 10&nbsp;<U+00B0>C (50&nbsp;<U+00B0>F), but on warmer slopes or rocky areas when it is colder.<ref name=O149/> There, ''Myotis alcathoe'' is relatively easy to capture in August, because ''M.&nbsp;brandtii'' and ''M.&nbsp;mystacinus'' already start swarming in late July.<ref name=OH112>Ohlendorf and Hoffmann, 2009, p. 112; Ohlendorf, 2009b, p. 149</ref> Although there are some records of ''Myotis alcathoe'' in caves during the winter, it is also possible that animals spend the winter in tree cavities, and whether swarming behavior occurs in ''Myotis alcathoe'' is unclear.<ref>Ohlendorf, 2009b, pp. 154, 156; Dietz et al., 2007, p. 233</ref> An animal found in a cave in Saxony-Anhalt in January was not sleeping deeply.<ref name=O149>Ohlendorf, 2009b, p. 149</ref> Reproduction may also take place in caves, but pregnant females have been found as late as June.<ref name=Dea234>Dietz et al., 2007, p. 234</ref> Relatively many juveniles are caught between July and September.<ref name=OF111>Ohlendorf and Funkel, 2008, p. 111</ref> In England, one individual of ''M.&nbsp;alcathoe'' was captured in 2003 (and identified at the time as ''M.&nbsp;brandtii'') and again in 2009.<ref name=Jea473>Jan et al., 2010, p. 473</ref> Three individuals that were [[telemetry|telemetrically]] tracked (in eastern France, Thuringia, and Baden-W<U+00FC>rttemberg, respectively) moved only 800&nbsp;m (2600&nbsp;ft), 935&nbsp;m (3070&nbsp;ft), and 1440&nbsp;m (4720&nbsp;ft) from their night quarters; ''M.&nbsp;brandtii'' and ''M.&nbsp;mystacinus'' tend to move over longer distances.<ref>Schorcht et al., 2009, p. 126</ref>

==Conservation status==
Because ''Myotis alcathoe'' remains poorly known, it is assessed as "[[Data Deficient]]" on the [[IUCN Red List]].<ref name=iucn/> However, it may be endangered because of its narrow ecological preferences.<ref name=Dea234/> Reservoir construction may threaten the species' habitat in some places; two Greek sites where it has been recorded have already been destroyed.<ref name=Hea221/> Forest loss is another possible threat,<ref name=iucn/> and the species may be restricted to undisturbed habitats.<ref name=Dea233>Dietz et al., 2007, p. 233</ref> Because of its patchy distribution and likely small population, it probably does not easily colonize new habitats.<ref name=Dea234/> The species is protected by national and international measures, but the IUCN Red List recommends further research on various aspects of the species as well as efforts to increase public awareness of the animal.<ref name=iucn/> In addition, old forests need to be conserved and the species' cave roosts need to be protected.<ref name=Dea235>Dietz et al., 2007, p. 235</ref>

In Catalonia, the species is listed as "Endangered" in view of its apparent rarity there.<ref>Flaquer et al., 2010, p. 42</ref> The Red List of Germany's Endangered Vertebrates lists ''Myotis alcathoe'' as "Critically Endangered" as of 2009.<ref>Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety, 2010, p. 8</ref> In Hungary, where the species is probably not uncommon in suitable habitat,<ref>Ministry of Rural Development, 2010, p. 4</ref> it has been protected since 2005.<ref>Ministry of Rural Development, 2010, p. 5</ref> However, the species is declining there and is threatened by [[habitat loss]] and disturbance of caves.<ref>Ministry of Rural Development, 2010, p. 1</ref>
