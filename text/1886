'''''The Altar and the Door''''' is the third [[studio album]] by American [[Christian rock]] band [[Casting Crowns]], released on August 28, 2007 on [[Beach Street Records]] and [[Reunion Records]]. Produced by Mark A. Miller, the album was inspired by [[lead singer]] [[Mark Hall (musician)|Mark Hall]]'s experience looking at the [[MySpace]] pages of his youth ministry students. The album's main theme is the difference between how Christians feel in church and the compromises they make outside of it. Its musical tone, which Hall says is different and more progressive, incorporates more of a  [[rock music|rock]] sound than their previous, more polished studio efforts.

''The Altar and the Door'' received positive to mixed reviews from critics upon its release. Particular praise was given to the lyrics and the album's overall concept, but some critics felt the album's sound was mediocre and uninventive. The album received the award for Pop/Contemporary Album of the Year at the [[39th GMA Dove Awards]]. It sold 129,000 copies in its first week, a record for a Christian album with no secular media support, enabling a debut at number one on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Christian Albums]] chart and number two on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and [[Digital Albums]] charts, only blocked on the latter charts by the [[High School Musical 2 (soundtrack)|soundtrack for High School Musical 2]]. It later topped the [[Top Pop Catalog Albums|Catalog Albums]] chart in 2010. The 18th best-selling Christian album of the 2000s, ''The Altar and the Door'' has sold over 1,000,000 copies in the [[United States]] and been [[RIAA certification|certified Platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). The [[lead single]] from ''The Altar and the Door'', "[[East to West (song)|East to West]]", was one of the most successful Christian singles of the 2000s, spending a total of 19 weeks atop the ''Billboard'' [[Christian Songs]] chart and peaking at twenty-five on the [[Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles]] chart. While not as successful as "East to West", follow-up singles "[[Every Man]]" and "[[Slow Fade]]"  were both top five hits on the Christian Songs chart.

==Background and recording==
The main ides for ''The Altar and the Door'' were inspired roughly eighteen months before the album's release. Lead vocalist [[Mark Hall (musician)|Mark Hall]] and his co-youth pastor were encouraged by one of their students to look at [[MySpace]]. According to Hall, <U+201C>It wasn<U+2019>t any major surprise, but we did see a lot of kids who had two worlds going on. MySpace can be Spring Break for the brain, this place you can go and not think anyone<U+2019>s ever going to find out. Kids would be listed as Christians and then show their porn star name or what kind of kisser they are. They were just presenting so many contradictions on one page. The temptation was to just get upset and think that<U+2019>s terrible. But MySpace isn<U+2019>t really a big problem&nbsp;<U+2013> it<U+2019>s just revealing what the problem is".<ref name="Casting's Call">{{cite journal|last=Hefner|first=April|date=September 2007|title=Casting's Call|journal=[[CCM Magazine]]|publisher=[[Salem Publishing]]|volume=30|issue=3|pages=26<U+2013>29|url=http://ht.salemweb.net/ccm/ccmmagazine/pdf/200709.pdf|accessdate=Jume 17, 2012}}</ref> He noted that this situation isn't unique to teenagers and that while at church "we [Christians] want to serve [God]" but when "we get out there in the world&nbsp;... it<U+2019>s just different. We want to be accepted; we want friends. The compromises start coming in small little increments until you<U+2019>re just kind of out there. Church becomes more of a guilt activator than a place to go to be with the Lord. It<U+2019>s a nasty place to live, and we all live there".<ref name="Casting's Call" /> Hall says that "When we<U+2019>re at the altar, everything<U+2019>s clear, and it all makes perfect sense, and we know how to live. We know what<U+2019>s right and what<U+2019>s wrong. The struggle is getting this life at the altar out the door&nbsp;... That<U+2019>s the problem; we<U+2019>re finding ourselves somewhere in the middle".<ref name="Casting's Call" /> Hall elaborated in a separate interview that "Somewhere between the altar and the door, it all leaks out and I'm out here wondering what to do, rationalising things instead of living the life that's in me. So the struggle that we have as believers is trying to get those truths (that are) in our heads and highlighted in our Bibles out to our hands and feet. The songs are all the things that happen in the middle of that". Although Hall says that he "always think[s] lyrics first", he felt that "Once we [Casting Crowns] got into the recording I knew we were in for something different, a more progressive approach to the music. These songs sounded different in my head; they've been a big challenge for us as a band. And the music definitely sets the tone for the whole project".<ref name="Cross Rhythms article">{{cite web|url=http://www.crossrhythms.co.uk/articles/music/Casting_Crowns_Exploring_compromise_in_The_Altar_And_The_Door/29263/p1/|title=Casting Crowns: Exploring compromise in 'The Altar And The Door'|last=Cummings|first=Tony|date=October 9, 2007|work=[[Cross Rhythms]]|accessdate=June 17, 2012}}</ref>

''The Altar and the Door'' received positive to mixed reviews upon its release. Jared Johnson of [[Allmusic]] gave it four-and-a-half out of five stars, saying it has a "slightly greater dose of rock" and "[[Casting Crowns]] gave fans no reason to be disappointed on Alter [sic]".<ref name="Allmusic review" /> Deborah Evans-Price of ''[[CCM Magazine]]'' gave it four out of five stars, commenting that "With this new set, [Mark] Hall and his companions again deliver songs that are musically engaging and lyrically insightful&nbsp;... Few acts more eloquently capture the complexities of being a Christian in today<U+2019>s tumultuous world, but these fine folks continue to help light the path for the rest of us".<ref name="CCM Magazine review" /> Jennifer E. Jones of [[Christian Broadcasting Network|cbnmusic.com]] gave it four out of five stars, opining that "There<U+2019>s a reason why Casting Crowns is one of the best Christian bands out today, and that reason is evident when you listen to ''The Altar and The Door''. After three albums, lead singer/songwriter Mark Hall still knows how to speak for those who cannot&nbsp;... ''The Altar and The Door'' leaves plenty of room for the sinners and the saints to come closer to Jesus".<ref name="CBN review" /> Mark Lawrence of ''[[Cross Rhythms]]'' gave the album nine out of ten stars, saying "Traditionally album number three is a defining point in a band's legacy: some bands self implode and produce an album high on production sheen but low on song quality&nbsp;... other bands though go on to produce their masterpiece&nbsp;... ''The Altar and the Door'' leans closer to the masterpiece than the flop but leaves you with a sense that they have even greater things to come&nbsp;... The Altar And The Door' is clearly a Casting Crowns album in sound, content and style but this is far from being a negative thing and will appeal to both existing fans as well as draw in new ones".<ref name="Cross Rhythms review" /> [[Brian Mansfield]] gave it two-and-a-half out of four stars, commenting that "[Casting Crowns] concern themselves with the space between the title<U+2019>s two fixtures&nbsp;<U+2013> that is, between intention and action, between doing good and getting in the way, or, as one song puts it, between <U+201C>the God we want and the God who is.<U+201D> That<U+2019>s a space worth exploring, and the band<U+2019>s motives may be the best, but their anthems are as predictable as a televangelist<U+2019>s tears: start soft, build big, then cue the strings".<ref name="USA Today review" />

Andree Farias of ''[[Christianity Today]]'' gave the album a negative review; although he praised Mark Hall's lyrical style and the album's lyrical concept and themes, he criticized the music as being "meandering melodies and an all-too-solemn disposition" and said "core fans will undoubtedly support this album, but those expecting the vitality and radio-friendliness of the band's previous releases will find it a relatively challenging listening experience".<ref name="Christianity Today review" /> Justin Mabee of [[Jesus Freak Hideout]] gave it two-and-a-half out of five stars, calling the lyrical content "slightly better [than the band's previous works]" but deriding the music as "more of the same".<ref name="JFH review" />
