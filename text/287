'''''Count Duckula''''' is a [[fictional character]], an [[anthropomorphic]] [[vegetarian]] [[vampire]] [[duck]] in the [[animated television series]] of the same name created by [[United Kingdom|British]] studio [[Cosgrove Hall]], and a spin-off from ''[[DangerMouse]]'', a show in which an evil version of the Count Duckula character was a recurring villain. The series first aired on [[September 6]], [[1988]]. In all, 65 episodes were made, each about 22 minutes long. The complete first season was released on DVD in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] on [[July 17]], [[2006]].

The show was a loose parody of the story of [[Count Dracula]]. Set in [[Transylvania]], Duckula lived in a spooky castle known as Castle Duckula, alongside his butler Igor, and his large Nanny (always referred to as "Nanny" and perpetually in an arm sling). Almost all of the characters in the show were ([[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphised]]) birds.

The story (as shown in the title sequence each episode) was that Duckula was active as a vampire for [[centuries]]. He could only be destroyed by exposure to [[sunlight]] or by a wooden [[stake]] thrust through his [[heart]]. Duckula had in fact died numerous deaths. But he always returned through a mystic ritual, performed once a century, "when the [[moon]] is in the eighth house of [[Aquarius (astrology)|Aquarius]]". However a theme explored through several episodes was that each [[resurrection]] created a new [[incarnation]] with little to no [[memory]] of its past. Thus every incarnation was free to develop its own personality and pursue its personal interests (somewhat similar to the regenerations of [[Doctor Who]]). Thus the vampire was able to pose as a dynasty of Counts of Duckula. The various succeeding generations included [[knight]]s, [[Magic (paranormal)|sorcerers]], [[scientist]]s, [[artist]]s and even professional [[Gambling|gamblers]]. All of them also secretly being "vicious vampire ducks".

But as the title sequence put it, "the latest reincarnation did not run according to plan." The successful conclusion of the ritual required [[blood]], the source of sustenance for any vampire. But his servants accidentally substituted it with [[tomato ketchup]]. Consequently the newest version was not a [[blood-sucking]] vampire but a vegetarian one. He was more interested in juicy [[carrot]]s rather than hunting for victims. Igor naturally felt appalled. Even worse, his "new" master was obsessed with pursuing [[wealth]] and fame as an [[entertainer]].

The show often centred around Duckula's adventures in search of riches and fame, assisted by the castle's ability to [[teleportation|teleport]] around the world. Another regular part of the story was Igor and his attempts to turn Duckula into a proper vampire. Some episodes featured Duckula's [[Wiktionary:nemesis|nemesis]] Doctor Von Goosewing (obviously based on Dr. [[Abraham Van Helsing]], the nemesis of [[Count Dracula (character)|Dracula]]), a vampire hunter who blindly refuses to believe the current incarnation of Duckula is harmless. Still others featured a whole array of bizarre, often supernatural foes, from [[zombie]]s to mechanical [[werewolf|werewolves]].

Speculation has been rife as to what species of duck [[Duckula]] is actually intended to be, though majority opinion holds that his character's features are based on those of the [[mallard]].

The first season was released on Region 1 [[DVD]] on [[October 4]], [[2005]]. A series of annuals and monthly comics further detailing the adventures of Count Duckula and associated characters were released throughout the time that the series originally aired and for a short time after. The Region 2 DVD of Season 1 was released on 17 July 2006.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}  The Region 2 DVD of Season 2 will be released on 26 March 2007.

The show's protagonist could be described as an [[ever-failing character]].

There was originally a [[cuckoo clock]] that had bat-like characters that would come out and make often corny jokes about the current situation. They were eventually removed.

The show's end credits were eventually edited, omitting many graphic effects.

==Characters==
===Protagonists===
* '''Count Duckula:''' Count Duckula himself was a deliberate send-up of many traditional vampire traits. As his name would suggest, he was a [[duck]].  Besides his vegetarianism and aspirations of fame, he was a very squeamish and often [[cowardice|cowardly]] character. The Duckula Family Motto was: "Per Ardua ad Sanguina" which meant "Work hard for blood". He had a very modern outlook, and often despaired over the traditional vampire image he was expected to embody. He hated living in a dark, gloomy [[castle]], and found the behaviour of his servants to be depressing. Although he retained vampiric powers and qualities such as [[teleportation]] and not being able to appear in front of a [[mirror]], he rarely used them. He often went outside in the daytime without suffering any ill effects, but this is likely because of his own personal oddities. In the "Doctor Goosewing and Mr. Duck" episode, Count Duckula briefly turned into a "proper" vampire, desiring blood from the villagers outside the castle, but turned away from the door when he discovered that the sun was still out. Still, the episode "Transylvanian Homesick Blues" featured a prehistoric "first vampire duck" who went out in daylight, and only returned to his [[coffin]] because Igor advised him to, while another Count of Duckula, in yet another episode, crumbled into a pile of stone when exposed to sunlight. Duckula has been seen on occasion wearing pyjamas with the Danger Mouse logo, a reference to the character's origin. Duckula was a short green duck with black parted hair and the traditional vampire [[evening wear]] complete with cape. He had no [[canine tooth|fang]]s, although his more old-fashioned relatives did. His favorite food was [[broccoli]] sandwiches.
* '''Igor:''' Igor was a traditional horror servant, and added a decidedly dark streak to some of the show's humour. He greatly disliked his master's behaviour, and often encouraged him to act in a far more ghastly manner. He remained convinced that if he could only talk Duckula into biting, maiming, [[torture|torturing]] and otherwise brutalizing people it would be a return to the "good old days". He was a hunched balding [[vulture]] with a depressed and slow voice. He had served under several previous incarnations of Count Duckula, making his age uncertain. Seeing as he can only be brought back "once a century" and Igor had performed the task multiple times in his life, he was clearly very old and possibly ageless. Episodes in the first season hinted that Igor had served the Duckulas for 700-800 years or more.
* '''Nanny:''' Nanny is, as her name would suggest, Duckula's [[nanny]], as well as [[housekeeper]]. She was an extremely large and clumsy [[hen]], possessing incredible strength and inevitably messing up whatever task she was set to do. In particular she had a [[blind spot]] regarding doors, and would often crash through a door without opening it first, or even walk right through the wall. As this behaviour suggests, she was a supremely unintelligent character, and completely unreliable. She was amazingly devoted to her "Ducky-Boos", as she called Duckula, and had a deep maternal affection for him, though her clumsiness often inadvertently caused him harm. A recurring gag was her inability to understand what people around her were talking about, often mixing up words and taking insult at conversations not directed at her. Like Igor, her age was uncertain, as she had apparently been with Duckula for several of his incarnations. Her right arm was perpetually in a [[sling]], though the reasons for this are unrevealed. The sling itself seemed to have unlimited carrying capacity, as she was able to produce any number of items from it, [[Harpo Marx]] style.  It is possible that if she did have a broken arm, that it has healed and she forgot to remove the sling, as demonstrated in the episode "In Arctic Circles".
* '''Castle Duckula:''' An old fashioned [[Transylvania]]n castle with all the trimmings: [[dungeon]], [[torture chamber]], library of macabre texts, laboratory, etc. The castle could teleport to any place on earth (and beyond) but returned automatically at dawn, "Transylvania standard time" as mentioned by Igor in the show. It was activated when Duckula entered an upright coffin while saying where he wanted it to take him (often, he would have to come up with a rhyme to activate it properly). The controls to this device were inside an old fashioned [[cuckoo clock]] that hung on the wall. Inside the clock lived two mechanical bats, Dmitri and Sviatoslav, who would punctuate each episode by coming out and delivering stale jokes to each other. These jokes were so bad that they actually drove a character who had been given the clock insane. The fact that the characters had thick Slavic accents, and that Sviatoslav often didn't understand the punchlines didn't help matters. The castle had an often referred to but never seen [[werewolf]] named Towser living in it.

===Antagonists===
* '''Dr Von Goosewing:''' Von Goosewing was a [[mad scientist]] and [[vampire hunter]], who was a spoof of [[Abraham Van Helsing]]. He was a goose, as his name suggested.  He was never able to comprehend that Count Duckula was a threat to nobody, and stalked him relentlessly. He was a terrible scientist, often getting maimed by his own crack-pot inventions. He was also supremely unobservant, and capable of bumping into Duckula and conversing with him for several minutes without realising who he was talking to. Von Goosewing spoke in a [[German language|German]] accent, and had an assistant who [[unseen character|never appeared on screen]] named "Heinrich". Von Goosewing often called for Heinrich and Heinrich was often blamed for Von Goosewing's mistakes. The [[comic book]] version of the characters by [[Marvel Comics]] revealed that Heinrich was actually his former assistant who was always complaining for his low [[wage]]. Von Goosewing mentioned that Heinrich threatened to [[resign]] but was still with him. Apparently Heinrich did quit but his former employer failed to realise it. When not inventing some new machine to hunt vampires with, he would rely on an old fashioned [[musket]] which was loaded with a wooden stake (although curiously it actually fired [[laser beam]]s). The [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] comic books based on the show also added a supporting character to him: his niece Vanna who Duckula had a crush on. Von Goosewing often flew a [[dirigible]] with 'VG' written on it. Von Goosewing wore an outfit not unlike that of [[Sherlock Holmes]] with a pair of [[spat]]s.
* '''The Crow Brothers:''' Four criminally inclined crows (Ruffles, Burt, Junior, and an unnamed one) who were typically seen scaling the walls of Castle Duckula with the aid of mountaineering equipment. They rarely made it to the top.  The four brothers were led by the tallest crow, Ruffles, who often had plans that went off.  The crows scaled the walls to get at the treasues inside the castle. The crows always wore masks (Ruffles wore a sock, Burt wore a sock as well, Junior wore a [[Peruvian]] cap and the fourth Crow Brother wore a sock which covered his face entirely) and were always seen hanging off one another with the use of bungee cords, to better climb the walls of whatever building they planned to scale.
*'''The Egg''': A supervillain [[egg (biology)|egg]] with a grudge against anyone that is alive, because he never was able to hatch from his egg. Along with his insidious schemes and plans was one parrot with an [[Asian]] complexion known as Oddbeak, who was very careful not to use words with the [[Prefix (linguistics)|prefix]] <U+00A8>Egg<U+00A8>, as he knew that it would offend his master.
* '''Gaston and Pierre:''' A pair of French criminals who served as occasional villains. Although they were both undeniably incompetent, the arrogant Gaston was ostensibly the brains of the outfit. Gaston was a tall, thin black [[stork]], while Pierre was a stubby, short parakeet.  It is always possible that the characters were an inspiration for yet another Cosgrove-Hall animated series - 'Victor and Hugo : Bunglers in Crime'
*'''The Phantom of the Opera and Cruel''': A duo of characters who once sought revenge on Count Duckula for foiling their plans. The Phantom was a tall, thin bird with the same mask worn by the original Phantom and dressed in dandefied clothers (complete with a cape), while Cruel was a short (if misshapen) bird who acted as the Phantom's manservant.
*'''Morris the Strongman and Charlie the Clown''': A pair of baleful circus performers who had a grudge on Duckula; both were bumbling (though Charlie was only slightly less so) and Morris was the brawn of their misdeeds.
*'''The Pirate Penguins''': A ruthless crew of piratical penguins who were hired by Count Duckula once, this crew of seafarers also turned on Count Duckula when his antics would crash their ship. All of the penguins were typical [[pirate]] stereotypes, one of which was known as Mr. Mate and shouting that he would "bite their heads off!"
*'''

===Neutrals===
* '''Narrator:''' The narrator opened and closed every episode, talking like a traditional horror host, and trying to make it seem as if the contents of the show were genuinely horrifying. Episodes usually began with him describing Castle Duckula and its gloomy atmosphere. They often closed with the narrator saying "Goodnight out there...WHATever you are!" Variants of this line were also used to close certain programmes.

* '''Relatives:''' Duckula had any number of vampiric relatives all over the world. These were more classic vampires than Duckula, possessing fangs, red eyes and evil personalities, and while any of them were killers and ne'er-do-wells, only a small number, such as Don Diego, showed any affinity or friendship toward the benign Count Duckula. They came from many different countries, such as [[Spain]], [[Scotland]] and [[Australia]], and represented the culture they were from in their outfits. Some such relatives were Don Diego, a [[Spain|Spanish]] vampire duck who made his fun and games by burning down villages, and McDuckula, a [[Scotland|Scottish]] vampire duck who later made himself an enemy of Duckula.

* '''The peasants:''' The town situated below Castle Duckula was home to many peasants who lived in constant fear of the Count, despite his dislike of human blood in his current incarnation. A recurring joke in the series and associated books was that 'the peasants are revolting.'

==Trivia==
* During episode nine, "All in a Fog," as Count Duckula is relating his reasons for wanting to become a detective and travel to London, the music being played under [[David Jason]]'s lines is the same music that was used as the introduction to Jason's "[[Captain Fantastic]]" segments in the 1967-69 children's series [[Do Not Adjust Your Set]]. Also in this episode we catch a glimpse of Danger Mouses's pillarbox residence.
* In [[Australia]] when it aired on [[Network Ten]] it was the second [[United Kingdom|British]] show on [[Cheez TV]].
* In a move mirroring Duckula's adaptation from Dangermouse, the characters of Gaston and Pierre were re-invented and given a spin-off series as the now-human [[Victor and Hugo]].
* Dr. Von Goosewing had different accents. On the [[United Kingdom|British]] version, he speaks with a [[Germany|German]] accent. It was accidentally changed to a [[Cockney]] accent for the Network Ten distribution. Despite the Cockney accent, he still has the German one on the [[video]] and [[DVD]] releases, even though the Danger Mouse character Stiletto still has his Italian accent during its Network Ten run.
* The Egg's servant, Oddbeak, had mannerisms and an appearance not unlike that of [[Oddjob]] of James Bond lore.
* The Crow Brother Ruffles had his name drawn from British literature (the fictional "gentleman thief" Raffles).
