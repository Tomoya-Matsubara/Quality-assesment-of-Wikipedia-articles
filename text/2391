'''Animal consciousness''', or '''animal awareness''', has been actively researched for over 100 years.<ref name=Burghardt>Burghardt, Gordon M (1985) [http://colinallen.dnsalias.org/Secure/X521/Burghardt%201985.pdf "Animal awareness: Current perceptions and historical perspective"] ''American Psychologist,'' '''40''' (8): 905<U+2013>919. {{doi|10.1037/0003-066X.40.8.905}}</ref> In 1927, Carr argued that any valid measure or understanding of awareness in animals depends on "an accurate and complete knowledge of its essential conditions in man".<ref>Carr, H (1927) "The interpretation of the animal mind". ''Psychological Review,'' p. 94. '''34''': 87<U+2013>106.</ref> According to Burghardt, 1985, "the best approach is to use experiment (especially psychophysics) and observation to trace the dawning and ontogeny of self-consciousness, perception, communication, intention, beliefs, and reflection in normal human fetuses, infants, and children."<ref name=Burghardt />

The topic of animal consciousness is beset by a number of difficulties.  It poses the [[problem of other minds]] in an especially severe form, because animals, lacking the ability to express human language, cannot tell us about their experiences.<ref name=Allen>{{cite web |author=Colin Allen |title=Animal consciousness |publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Summer 2011 Edition) |editor=Edward N. Zalta |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2011/entries/consciousness-animal/}}</ref>  Also, it is difficult to reason objectively about the question, because a denial that an animal is conscious is often taken to imply that it does not feel, its life has no value, and that harming it is not morally wrong. The 17th-century French philosopher [[Ren<U+00E9> Descartes]], for example, has sometimes been blamed for mistreatment of animals because he argued that only humans are conscious.<ref>{{cite journal |authors=[[Peter Carruthers (philosopher)|Peter Carruthers]] |title=Sympathy and subjectivity |journal=Australasian Journal of Philosophy |year=1999 |volume=77 |pages=465<U+2013>482}}</ref>

Philosophers who consider subjective experience the essence of consciousness also generally believe, as a correlate, that the existence and nature of animal consciousness can never rigorously be known.  [[Thomas Nagel]] spelled out this point of view in an influential essay titled ''[[What Is it Like to Be a Bat?]]''.  He said that an organism is conscious "if and only if there is something that it is like to be that organism <U+2014> something it is like ''for'' the organism"; and he argued that no matter how much we know about an animal's brain and behavior, we can never really put ourselves into the mind of the animal and experience its world in the way it does itself.<ref name=NagelBat>{{cite book| author=[[Thomas Nagel]] |title=Mortal Questions |chapter=Ch. 12 What is it like to be a bat? |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1991 |isbn=978-0-521-40676-5}}</ref>  Other thinkers, such as [[Douglas Hofstadter]], dismiss this argument as incoherent.<ref>{{cite book |author=[[Douglas Hofstadter]] |chapter=Reflections on ''What Is It Like to Be a Bat?'' |pages=403<U+2013>414 |title=[[The Mind's I]] |editors=[[Douglas Hofstadter]] and [[Daniel Dennett]] |publisher=Basic Books |year=1981 |isbn=046504624}}</ref>  Several psychologists and ethologists have argued for the existence of animal consciousness by describing a range of behaviors that appear to show animals holding beliefs about things they cannot directly perceive <U+2014> [[Donald Griffin]]'s 2001 book ''Animal Minds'' reviews a substantial portion of the evidence.<ref name=Griffin2001>{{cite book |title=Animal Minds: Beyond Cognition to Consciousness |author=[[Donald Griffin]] |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-226-30865-4}}</ref>

==Philosophical background==
[[File:Jan Baptist Weenix - Portrait of Ren<U+00E9> Descartes.jpg|thumb|right|Ren<U+00E9> Descartes argued that animals are not conscious]]

The [[mind<U+2013>body problem]] in philosophy examines the relationship between [[mind]] and matter, and in particular the relationship between [[consciousness]] and the brain. A variety of approaches have been proposed.  Most are either [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualist]] or [[Monism|monist]]. Dualism maintains a rigid distinction between the realms of mind and matter. Monism maintains that there is only one kind of stuff, and that mind and matter are both aspects of it. The problem was addressed by pre-[[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] philosophers,<ref name="Young">{{cite book  |editor=RC Olby, GN Cantor, JR Christie, MJS Hodges, eds |title= Companion to the History of Modern Science |publisher=Taylor and Francis |year= 1996 |pages= 702<U+2013>11 |isbn=0415145783 |chapter=The mind-body problem |url=http://human-nature.com/rmyoung/papers/pap102h.html |author= Robert M.

Descartes believed that humans only, and not animals have this non-physical mind. 

The rejection of the mind<U+2013>body dichotomy is found in French [[Structuralism]], and is a position that generally characterized post-war [[French philosophy]].<ref name=Turner>{{cite book |title=The Body and Society: Explorations in Social Theory |author=Bryan S.

The absence of an empirically identifiable meeting point between the non-physical mind and its physical extension has proven problematic to dualism and many modern philosophers of mind maintain that the mind is not something separate from the body.<ref name="Kim1">{{cite book

===Epiphenomenalism===
[[Epiphenomenalism]] is the theory in [[philosophy of mind]] that mental phenomena are caused by physical processes in the brain or that both are effects of a common cause, as opposed to mental phenomena driving the physical mechanics of the brain. The impression that thoughts, feelings, or sensations cause physical effects, is therefore to be understood as illusory to some extent. For example, it is not the feeling of fear that produces an increase in heart beat, both are symptomatic of a common physiological origin, possibly in response to a legitimate external threat.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/epipheno/| title=Epiphenomenalism| author=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy| accessdate=2012, Feb, 5}}</ref>

The history of epiphenomenalism goes back to the post-Cartesian attempt to solve the riddle of [[Cartesian dualism]], i.e., of how mind and body could interact.  [[Julien Offray de La Mettrie|La Mettrie]], [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]] and [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]] all in their own way began this way of thinking. The idea that even if the animal were conscious nothing would be added to the production of behavior, even in animals of the human type, was first voiced by La Mettrie (1745), and then by [[Pierre Jean George Cabanis|Cabanis]] (1802), and was further explicated by [[Hodgson]] (1870) and [[T.H. Huxley|Huxley]] (1874).<ref>Huxley, T. H. (1874). "On the Hypothesis that Animals are Automata, and its History", ''The Fortnightly Review'', n.s.16:555-580. Reprinted in ''Method and Results: Essays by Thomas H. Huxley'' (New York: D. Appleton and Company, 1898)</ref><ref>Gallagher, S. 2006. "Where's the action?: Epiphenomenalism and the problem of free will". In W. Banks, S. Pockett, and S. Gallagher. ''Does Consciousness Cause Behavior? An Investigation of the Nature of Intuition'' (109-124). Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.</ref> Huxley (1874) likened mental phenomena to the whistle on a steam locomotive. However, epiphenomenalism flourished primarily as it found a niche among methodological or scientific behaviorism. In the early 1900s [[behaviorism|scientific behaviorists]] such as [[Ivan Pavlov]], [[John B. Watson]], and [[B. F. Skinner]] began the attempt to uncover laws describing the relationship between stimuli and responses, without reference to inner mental phenomena. Instead of adopting a form of [[eliminative materialism|eliminativism]] or mental [[fictionalism]], positions that deny that inner mental phenomena exist, a behaviorist was able to adopt epiphenomenalism in order to allow for the existence of mind. However, by the 1960s, scientific behaviourism met substantial difficulties and eventually gave way to the [[cognitive revolution]]. Participants in that revolution, such as [[Jerry Fodor]], reject epiphenomenalism and insist upon the efficacy of the mind. Fodor even speaks of "epiphobia"&mdash;fear that one is becoming an epiphenomenalist.

===Animal ethics===
[[Bernard Rollin]] of Colorado State University, the principal author of two U.S. federal laws regulating pain relief for animals, writes that researchers remained unsure into the 1980s as to whether animals experience pain, and veterinarians trained in the U.S. before 1989 were simply taught to ignore animal pain.<ref name=Rollin117>Rollin, Bernard. ''The Unheeded Cry: Animal Consciousness, Animal Pain, and Science''. New York: Oxford University Press, 1989, pp. xii, 117-118, cited in Carbone 2004, p. 150.</ref> In his interactions with scientists and other veterinarians, Rollin was regularly asked to prove animals are conscious and  provide scientifically acceptable grounds for claiming they feel pain.<ref name=Rollin117/> Academic reviews of the topic are equivocal, noting that the argument that animals have at least simple conscious thoughts and feelings has strong support,<ref>Griffin DR, Speck GB (2004) "New evidence of animal consciousness" ''Anim.

In 1976 [[Richard Dawkins]] wrote, "The evolution of the capacity to simulate seems to have culminated in subjective consciousness. Why this should have happened is, to me, the most profound mystery facing modern biology".<ref>[[Richard Dawkins]], [[The Selfish Gene]].</ref> In 2004, eight neuroscientists felt it was still too soon for a definition.  They wrote an apology in "Human Brain Function":<ref>''Human Brain Function'', by Richard Frackowiak and 7 other neuroscientists, page 269 in chapter 16 "The Neural Correlates of Consciousness" (consisting of 32 pages), published 2004</ref>
::"We have no idea how consciousness emerges from the physical activity of the brain and we do not know whether consciousness can emerge from non-biological systems, such as computers...  At this point the reader will expect to find a careful and precise definition of consciousness.  You will be disappointed.  Consciousness has not yet become a scientific term that can be defined in this way.  Currently we all use the term ''consciousness'' in many different and often ambiguous ways. Precise definitions of different aspects of consciousness will emerge ... but to make precise definitions at this stage is premature."

[[Consciousness]] is sometimes defined as the quality or state of being aware of an external object or something within oneself.<ref>{{cite web|title=consciousness|publisher=Merriam-Webster|author=|location=|date=|accessdate=June 4, 2012|url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/consciousness}}</ref><ref name="van_Gulick2004">{{cite web |author=Robert van Gulick |year=2004 |title=Consciousness |publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consciousness/}}</ref>  It has been defined somewhat vaguely as: [[subjectivity]], [[awareness]], [[sentience]], the ability to [[experience]] or to  [[feeling|feel]], wakefulness, having a sense of [[self]]hood, and the executive control system of the mind.<ref name=Farthing1992Psychology>{{cite book| title=The Psychology of Consciousness |author=Farthing G |year=1992 |publisher=Prentice Hall |isbn=978-0-13-728668-3}}</ref> Despite the difficulty in definition, many philosophers believe that there is a broadly shared underlying intuition about what consciousness is.<ref>{{cite book |author=[[John Searle]] |year=2005 |editor=Honderich T |title=The Oxford companion to philosophy |chapter=Consciousness |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-926479-7}}</ref> [[Max Velmans]] and Susan Schneider wrote in ''The Blackwell Companion to Consciousness'':  "Anything that we are aware of at a given moment forms part of our consciousness, making conscious experience at once the most familiar and most mysterious aspect of our lives."<ref>{{cite book |authors=Susan Schneider and [[Max Velmans]] |year=2008 |chapter=Introduction |editors=Max Velmans, Susan Schneider |title=The Blackwell Companion to Consciousness |publisher=Wiley |isbn=978-0-470-75145-9}}</ref>

Related terms, also often used in vague or ambiguous ways, are:
* [[Awareness]]: the state or ability to perceive, to feel, or to be [[conscious]] of events, [[Object (philosophy)|objects]], or sensory [[pattern]]s. In this level of consciousness, sense data can be confirmed by an observer without necessarily implying [[understanding]]. More broadly, it is the state or quality of being aware of something. In [[biological psychology]], awareness is defined as a human's or an animal's [[perception]] and [[cognitive]] reaction to a condition or event.
* [[Self-awareness]]: the capacity for [[introspection]] and the ability to reconcile oneself as an individual separate from the environment and other individuals.
* [[Self-consciousness]]: an [[Acute (medicine)|acute]] sense of self-awareness. It is a preoccupation with oneself, as opposed to the philosophical state of [[self-awareness]], which is the awareness that one exists as an individual being; although some writers use both terms interchangeably or synonymously.<ref>Richard P. Lipka/Thomas M. Brinthaupt ''Self-perspectives Across the Life Span'', p. 228, SUNY Press, 1992 ISBN 978-0-7914-1003-5</ref>
* [[Sentience]]: the ability to be aware ([[feeling|feel]], [[perception|perceive]], or be [[consciousness|conscious]]) of one's surroundings  or to have subjective experiences.  Sentience is a minimalistic way of defining consciousness, which is otherwise commonly used to collectively describe sentience plus other characteristics of the mind.
* [[Sapience]]: often defined as wisdom, or the ability of an organism or entity to act with appropriate [[Value judgment|judgment]], a mental faculty which is a component of [[Intelligence (trait)|intelligence]] or alternatively may be considered an additional faculty, apart from intelligence, with its own properties.

Sentience (being aware of one's surroundings) is not the same as self-awareness (being aware of oneself as an individual). The  [[mirror test]] is sometimes considered to be an operational test for self-awareness, and the handful of animals that have passed the [[mirror test]] are often considered to be self-aware.<ref>Gallup Jr GG, JR Anderson JR and Shillito DJ (2002) [http://colinallen.dnsalias.org/Secure/TCA/gallup-final.pdf "The mirror test"] In: Bekoff M, Allen C and Burghardt GM (eds.)

Much has been learned in neuroscience about correlations between brain activity and subjective, conscious experiences, and many suggest that neuroscience will ultimately explain consciousness; "...consciousness is a biological process that will eventually be explained in terms of molecular signaling pathways used by interacting populations of nerve cells...".<ref name=Kandel>{{cite book |pages= 9 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=PFnRwWXzypgC&pg=PA9&lpg=PA9 |author=Eric R.

==Scientific approaches==
Since [[Descartes]]'s proposal of [[dualism]], it became a general consensus that the mind had become a matter of [[philosophy]] and that science was not able to penetrate the issue of consciousness-  that consciousness was outside of space and time. However, over the last 20 years, many scholars have begun to move toward a science of consciousness.  Such notable neuroscientists that have led the move to neural correlates of the self and of consciousness are [[Antonio Damasio]] and [[Gerald Edelman]].  Damasio has demonstrated that emotions and their biological foundation play a critical role in high level cognition,<ref>Damasio, A. (1999). The Feeling of What Happens: Body, Emotion and the Making ofConsciousness. Harcourt Brace, 1999.</ref><ref>Damasio, A. (2003). Feelings of emotion and the self. In J. LeDoux, J. Debiec & H. Moss (Eds.), Self: from Soul to Brain (Vol. 1001, pp. 253-261). New York: New York Acad Sciences.</ref> and Edelman has created a framework for analyzing consciousness through a scientific outlook. The current problem consciousness researchers face involves explaining how and why consciousness arises from neural computation.<ref>Chalmers D J, Facing up to the problem of consciousness, J Cons Stud, 2 (1995) 200.</ref><ref>Chalmers D J, The conscious mind: In search of a fundamental theory (Oxford University Press, New York) 1996.</ref> In his research on this problem, Edelman has developed a theory of consciousness, in which he has coined the terms [[primary consciousness]] and secondary consciousness.<ref name="Edelman"/><ref>Edelman, G. M.,  Tononi, G. (2000). A Universe of Consciousness: How Matter Becomes Imagination. New York: Basic Books</ref>

[[Eugene Linden]], author of ''The Parrot's Lament'' suggests there are many examples of animal behavior and intelligence that surpass what people would suppose to be the boundary of animal consciousness. Linden contends that in many of these documented examples, a variety of animal species exhibits behavior that can only be attributed to emotion, and to a level of consciousness that we would normally ascribe only to our own species.<ref>Linden, Eugene (2000) [http://books.google.co.nz/books?id=Cfp00m1k-BsC&q=%22The+Parrot%27s+Lament%22+%22Eugene+Linden%22&dq=%22The+Parrot%27s+Lament%22+%22Eugene+Linden%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=TTfRUJjXKOTRmAXg14GYDQ&ved=0CDQQ6AEwAA ''The Parrot's Lament: And Other True Tales of Animal Intrigue, Intelligence, and Ingenuity"] Cengage Gale. ISBN 9780783890319.</ref>

Philosopher [[Daniel Dennett]] counters that:
{{quote|Consciousness requires a certain kind of informational organization that does not seem to be 'hard-wired' in humans, but is instilled by human culture. Moreover, consciousness is not a black-or-white, all-or-nothing type of phenomenon, as is often assumed. The differences between humans and other species are so great that speculations about animal consciousness seem ungrounded. Many authors simply assume that an animal like a bat has a point of view, but there seems to be little interest in exploring the details involved.<ref>[http://instruct.westvalley.edu/lafave/dennett_anim_csness.html Animal consciousness: what matters and why] Daniel Dennett</ref>}}

Consciousness in mammals (this includes humans) is an aspect of the mind generally thought to comprise qualities such as [[subjectivity]], [[sentience]], and the ability to [[perception|perceive]] the relationship between [[Personal identity (philosophy)|oneself]] and one's [[environment (biophysical)|environment]]. It is a subject of much research in [[philosophy of mind]], [[psychology]], [[neuroscience]], and [[cognitive science]]. Some philosophers divide consciousness into [[phenomena]]l consciousness, which is subjective experience itself, and access consciousness, which refers to the global availability of information to processing systems in the brain.<ref name="Bl">Ned Block: ''On a Confusion about a Function of Consciousness" in: ''The Behavioral and Brain Sciences'', 1995.</ref> Phenomenal consciousness has many different experienced qualities, often referred to as [[qualia]]. Phenomenal consciousness is usually consciousness ''of'' something or ''about'' something, a property known as [[intentionality]] in philosophy of mind.

The sense in which animals (or human infants) can be said to have [[consciousness]] or a [[self-concept]] has been hotly debated; it is often referred to as the debate over animal minds. The best known research technique in this area is the [[mirror test]] devised by [[Gordon G. Gallup]], in which the skin of an animal (or human infant) is marked while it is asleep or sedated with a mark that cannot be seen directly but is visible in a mirror. It is then allowed to see its reflection in a mirror; if the animal spontaneously directs grooming behavior towards the mark, that is taken as an indication that it is aware of itself.<ref>Bischof-K<U+00F6>hler, D.

There have been numerous findings in the past 30 years which display fairly clear evidence of possessors of self-recognition. Self-awareness, by this criterion, has been reported for:

It was recently thought that self-recognition was restricted to mammals with large brains and highly evolved social cognition but absent from animals without a [[neocortex]]. However, in a recent study, an investigation of self-recognition in [[corvids]] was carried out, and significant result quantified the ability of self-recognition in the magpie. Mammals and birds inherited the same brain components from their last common [[ancestor]] nearly 300 million years ago, and have since independently evolved and formed significantly different brain types. The results of the mirror and mark tests showed that neocortex-less [[magpies]] are capable of understanding that a mirror image belongs to their own body. The findings show that magpies respond in the mirror and mark test in a manner similar to apes, dolphins and elephants. This is a remarkable capability that, although not fully concrete in its determination of self-recognition, is at least a prerequisite of self-recognition. This is not only of interest regarding the convergent evolution of social intelligence; it is also valuable for an understanding of the general principles that govern cognitive evolution and their underlying neural mechanisms. The magpies were chosen to study based on their empathy/ lifestyle, a possible precursor for their ability of self-awareness.<ref name="Magpie"/>

It should be mentioned that even in the chimpanzee, the species most studied and with the most convincing findings, clear-cut evidence of self-recognition is not obtained in all individuals tested. Occurrence is about 75% in young adults and considerably less in young and old individuals.<ref>Povinelli DJ, Rulf AB, Landau KR, Bierschwale DT (1993) Self-recognition in chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes): distribution, ontogeny, and patterns of emergence.

Another approach to determine whether a non-human animal is conscious derives from passive speech research with a macaw (see [[Talking Birds#Arielle|Arielle]]). Some researchers propose that by passively listening to an animal's voluntary speech, it is possible to learn about the thoughts of another creature and to determine that the speaker is conscious. This type of research was originally used to investigate a child's [[crib talk|crib speech]] by Weir (1962) and in investigations of early speech in children by Greenfield and others (1976).

===Pain or suffering===
{{see also|Pain in animals}}

Further arguments revolve around the ability of animals to feel [[pain]] or [[suffering]]. Suffering implies consciousness. If animals can be shown to suffer in a way similar or identical to humans, many of the arguments against human suffering could then, presumably, be extended to animals. Others have argued that pain can be demonstrated by averse reactions to negative stimuli that are non-purposeful or even maladaptive.<ref>ALAN CARTER (2005) Animals, Pain and Morality Journal of Applied Philosophy 22 (1) , 17<U+2013>22 {{doi|10.1111/j.1468-5930.2005.00289.x}}</ref>  One such reaction is [[transmarginal inhibition]], a phenomenon observed in humans and some animals akin to [[mental breakdown]].

As noted by John Webster, a professor of animal husbandry at Bristol:
{{quote|People have assumed that intelligence is linked to the ability to suffer and that because animals have smaller brains they suffer less than humans. That is a pathetic piece of logic, sentient animals have the capacity to experience pleasure and are motivated to seek it, you only have to watch how cows and lambs both seek and enjoy pleasure when they lie with their heads raised to the sun on a perfect English summer's day. Just like humans.<ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2087-1502933,00.html The secret life of moody cows] John Webster</ref>}}

However, there is no agreement where the line between organisms that can feel pain and those that cannot should be drawn. Justin Leiber, a philosophy professor at [[Oxford University]] writes that:
{{quote|[[Montaigne]] is ecumenical in this respect, claiming consciousness for spiders and ants, and even writing of our duties to trees and plants. [[Peter Singer|Singer]] and [[Samuel Clarke|Clarke]] agree in denying consciousness to sponges. Singer locates the distinction somewhere between the shrimp and the oyster. He, with rather considerable convenience for one who is thundering hard accusations at others, slides by the case of insects and spiders and bacteria, they pace Montaigne, apparently and rather conveniently do not feel pain. The intrepid [[Midgley]], on the other hand, seems willing to speculate about the subjective experience of tapeworms ...[[Thomas Nagel|Nagel]] ... appears to draw the line at flounders and wasps, though more recently he speaks of the inner life of cockroaches.<ref>Leiber, Justin, "'Cartesian Linguistics?'" Philosophia, 118 (1988):309-46.</ref>}}

There are also some who reject the argument entirely, arguing that although suffering animals feel anguish, a suffering plant also struggles to stay alive (albeit in a less visible way). In fact, no living organism 'wants' to die for another organism's sustenance. In an article written for the [[New York Times]], Carol Kaesuk Yoon argues that:

{{quote|When a plant is wounded, its body immediately kicks into protection mode. It releases a bouquet of volatile chemicals, which in some cases have been shown to induce neighboring plants to pre-emptively step up their own chemical defenses and in other cases to lure in predators of the beasts that may be causing the damage to the plants. Inside the plant, repair systems are engaged and defenses are mounted, the molecular details of which scientists are still working out, but which involve signaling molecules coursing through the body to rally the cellular troops, even the enlisting of the genome itself, which begins churning out defense-related proteins ... If you think about it, though, why would we expect any organism to lie down and die for our dinner? Organisms have evolved to do everything in their power to avoid being extinguished. How long would any lineage be likely to last if its members effectively didn<U+2019>t care if you killed them? <ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/15/science/15food.html?pagewanted=all No Face, but Plants Like Life Too] Carol Kaesuk Yoon, the New York Times</ref>}}

===Neuroscience===
[[File:PurkinjeCell.jpg|right|thumb|Drawing by [[Santiago Ram<U+00F3>n y Cajal]] (1899) of [[neuron]]s in the pigeon cerebellum]]

[[Neuroscience]] is the scientific study of the [[nervous system]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Neuroscience|work=Merriam-Webster Medical Dictionary|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/medlineplus/neuroscience}}</ref> It is a highly active [[interdisciplinary]] science that collaborates with many other fields. The scope of neuroscience has broadened recently to include [[molecular biology|molecular]], [[cellular neuroscience|cellular]], [[neural development|developmental]], [[neuroanatomy|structural]], [[neurophysiology|functional]], [[evolutionary neuroscience|evolutionary]], [[computational neuroscience|computational]], and [[neurological disorders|medical]] aspects of the nervous system. Theoretical studies of [[neural network]]s are being complemented with techniques for [[brain mapping|imaging]] sensory and motor tasks in the [[brain]].
According to a 2008 paper, neuroscience explanations of psychological phenomena currently have a "seductive allure", and "seem to generate more public interest" than explanations which do not contain neuroscientific information.<ref name=Weisberg2008>Weisberg DS, Keil FC, Goodstein J, Rawson E and Gray JR (2008) [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2778755/ "The seductive allure of neuroscience explanations"] ''Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience'', '''20''' (3): 470<U+2013>477. {{doi|10.1162/jocn.2008.20040}}</ref> They found that subjects who were not neuroscience experts "judged that explanations with logically irrelevant neuroscience information were more satisfying than explanations without.<ref name=Weisberg2008 />

====Neural correlates====
{{see also|Neural correlates of consciousness}}

The [[neural correlates of consciousness]] constitute the minimal set of neuronal events and mechanisms sufficient for a specific conscious [[Perception#Process and terminology|percept]].<ref>[[#Koch2004|Koch 2004]], p. 304.</ref> Neuroscientists use empirical approaches to discover [[neural correlate]]s of subjective phenomena.<ref>See [http://www.klab.caltech.edu/~koch/glossary.html here] for a glossary of related terms.</ref> The set should be ''minimal'' because, if the brain is sufficient to give rise to any given conscious experience, the question is which of its components is necessary to produce it.

A feature that distinguishes humans from most animals is that we are not born with an extensive repertoire of behavioral programs that would enable us to survive on our own ("[[physiological prematurity]]"). To compensate for this, we have an unmatched ability to learn, i.e., to consciously acquire such programs by imitation or exploration. Once consciously acquired and sufficiently exercised, these programs can become automated to the extent that their execution happens beyond the realms of our awareness. Take, as an example, the incredible fine motor skills exerted in playing a Beethoven piano sonata or the sensorimotor coordination required to ride a motorcycle along a curvy mountain road. Such complex behaviors are possible only because a sufficient number of the subprograms involved can be executed with minimal or even suspended conscious control. In fact, the conscious system may actually interfere somewhat with these automated programs.<ref>[[#Beilock2002|Beilock et al. 2002]]</ref>

The growing ability of neuroscientists to manipulate neurons using methods from molecular biology in combination with optical tools depends on the simultaneous development of appropriate behavioural assays and model organisms amenable to large-scale genomic analysis and manipulation.<ref>Adamantidis A.R., Zhang F., Aravanis A.M., Deisseroth K. and de Lecea L. (2007) "Neural substrates of awakening probed with optogenetic control of hypocretin neurons". ''Nature''.</ref> A combination of such fine-grained neuronal analysis in animals with ever more sensitive psychophysical and brain imaging techniques in humans, complemented by the development of a robust theoretical predictive framework, will hopefully lead to a rational understanding of consciousness.

====Neocortex====
[[File:Taeniopygia guttata -Karratha, Pilbara, Western Australia, Australia -male-8 (2).jpg|thumb|right|Previously researchers had thought that patterns of neural sleep exhibited by [[zebra finch]]es needed a mammalian [[neocortex]]<ref name=CDC />]]

The [[neocortex]] is a part of the brain of mammals. It consists of the [[grey matter]], or neuronal cell bodies and [[myelin|unmyelinated]] fibers, surrounding the deeper [[white matter]] ([[myelin]]ated [[axon]]s) in the [[cerebrum]]. The neocortex is smooth in [[rodent]]s and other small mammals, whereas in [[primate]]s and other larger mammals it has deep grooves and wrinkles. These folds increase the surface area of the neocortex considerably without taking up too much more volume. Also, neurons within the same wrinkle have more opportunity for connectivity, while neurons in different wrinkles have less opportunity for connectivity, leading to compartmentalization of the cortex. The neocortex is divided into [[frontal lobe|frontal]], [[parietal lobe|parietal]], [[occipital lobe|occipital]], and [[temporal lobe|temporal]] lobes, which perform different functions. For example, the occipital lobe contains the [[primary visual cortex]], and the temporal lobe contains the [[primary auditory cortex]]. Further subdivisions or areas of neocortex are responsible for more specific cognitive processes. The neocortex is the newest part of the [[cerebral cortex]] to evolve (hence the prefix "neo"); the other parts of the cerebral cortex are the [[paleocortex]] and [[archicortex]], collectively known as the [[allocortex]]. In humans, 90% of the cerebral cortex is neocortex.

Researchers have argued that consciousness arises in the neocortex, and therefore cannot arise in animals which lack a neocortex. For example, Rose argued in 2002 that the "fishes have nervous systems that mediate effective escape and avoidance responses to noxious stimuli, but, these responses must occur without a concurrent, human-like awareness of pain, suffering or distress, which depend on separately evolved neocortex."<ref>Rose, James D. (2002) [http://www.nal.usda.gov/awic/pubs/Fishwelfare/Rose.pdf "The neurobehavioral nature of fishes and the question of awareness and pain"] ''Reviews in Fisheries Science'', '''10''' (1): 1<U+2013>38.</ref> Recently that view has been challenged, and many researchers now believe that animal consciousness can arise from [[Homology (biology)|homologous]] [[subcortical]] brain networks.<ref name=CDC />

====Attention====
[[Attention]] is the [[cognitive process]] of selectively concentrating on one aspect of the environment while ignoring other things. Attention has also been referred to as the allocation of processing resources.<ref>{{cite book |last=Anderson |first=John R. |authorlink=John Robert Anderson (psychologist) |year=2004 |title=Cognitive psychology and its implications (6th ed.) |publisher=Worth Publishers |url= http://books.google.com/?id=9P4p6eAULMoC |isbn=978-0-7167-0110-1 |page=519}}</ref> Attention also has variations amongst cultures. Voluntary attention develops in specific cultural and institutional contexts through engagement in cultural activities with more competent community members.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Chavajay|first=Pablo|coauthors=Barbara Rogoff|title=Cultural variation in management of attention by children and their caregivers|journal=Developmental psychology|year=1999|volume=35|issue=4|pages=1079<U+2013>1090}}</ref>

Most experiments show that one [[neural correlate]] of attention is enhanced firing. If a neuron has a certain response to a stimulus when the animal is not attending to the stimulus, then when the animal does attend to the stimulus, the neuron's response will be enhanced even if the physical characteristics of the stimulus remain the same. In many cases attention produces changes in the [[EEG]]. Many animals, including humans, produce [[gamma wave]]s (40<U+2013>60&nbsp;Hz) when focusing attention on a particular object or activity.<ref>{{cite journal |author= Kaiser J, Lutzenberger W |title=Induced gamma-band activity and human brain function |journal=Neuroscientist |volume=9 |pages=475<U+2013>84 |year=2003 |pmid=14678580 |doi=10.1177/1073858403259137 |issue=6}}</ref>

====Extended consciousness====
[[Extended consciousness]] is an animal's autobiographical self-perception. It is thought to arise in the brains of animals which have a substantial capacity for memory and reason. It does not necessarily require language. The perception of a historic and future self arises from a stream of information from the immediate environment and from neural structures related to memory. The concept was popularised by [[Antonio Damasio]] and is used in [[biological psychology]]. Extended consciousness is said to arise in structures in the [[human brain]] described as ''image spaces'' and ''dispositional spaces''. Image spaces imply areas where [[senses|sensory]] impressions of all types are processed, including the focused awareness of the [[core consciousness]]. Dispositional spaces include convergence zones, which are networks in the brain where memories are processed and recalled, and where knowledge is merged with immediate experience.<ref>[http://www.creativitycountry.net.au/creativity/consciousness.htm <U+2018>Layers<U+2019> or <U+2018>levels<U+2019> of consciousness?]</ref><ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,32273,00.html Time Magazine 1999 'Mystery Of Consciousness']</ref>

====Metacognition====
It has been suggested that [[metacognition]] in some animals provides some evidence for cognitive self-awareness.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1037/a0020129 |last = Couchman |first = Justin J. |coauthors = Coutinho, M.

===Neural Darwinism===
{{main|Neural Darwinism}}

The American biologist [[Gerald Edelman]] distinguishes between primary and secondary consciousness:

* [[Primary consciousness]]: is the ability, found in humans and some animals, to integrate observed events with memory to create an [[awareness]] of the present and immediate past of the world around them. This form of consciousness is also sometimes called "sensory consciousness". Put another way, primary consciousness is the presence of various [[subjectivity|subjective]] sensory contents of consciousness such as [[sensation (psychology)|sensation]]s, [[perception]]s, and mental images. For example, primary consciousness includes a person's experience of the blueness of the ocean, a bird's song, and the feeling of pain. Thus, primary consciousness refers to  being mentally aware of things in the world in the present without any sense of past and future; it is composed of mental images bound to a time around the measurable present.<ref name = Edelmansky>Edelman, G. (2004). ''Wider than the sky: The phenomenal gift of consciousness'': Yale Univ Pr.</ref>

* [[Secondary consciousness]]: is an individual's accessibility to their history and plans. The concept is also loosely and commonly associated with having awareness of one's own [[consciousness]]. The ability allows its possessors to go beyond the limits of the remembered present of [[primary consciousness]]. The term was also coined by [[Gerald Edelman]].<ref name="Edelman">Edelman, G. M. (2003). Naturalizing consciousness: a theoretical framework. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 100, 5520<U+2013>5524.</ref> 

Primary consciousness can be defined as simple awareness that includes [[perception]] and [[emotion]]. As such, it is ascribed to most animals. By contrast, secondary consciousness depends on and includes such features as self-reflective awareness, [[abstract thinking]], [[Volition (psychology)|volition]] and [[metacognition]].<ref name="Edelman"/><ref>Edelman, G. M. (1992). Bright Air, Brilliant Fire: On the Matter of the Mind. Basic Books, New York.</ref>

Edelman's theory focuses on two [[nervous system]] organizations: the [[brainstem]] and [[limbic system]]s on one side and the [[thalamus]] and [[cerebral cortex]] on the other side. The brain stem and limbic system take care of essential body functioning and survival, while the thalamocortical system receives signals from sensory receptors and sends out signals to voluntary muscles such as those of the arms and legs. The theory asserts that the connection of these two systems during evolution helped animals learn [[adaptive behavior]]s.<ref name = Edelmansky/> 

Other scientists have argued against Edelman's theory, instead suggesting that primary consciousness might have emerged with the basic vegetative systems of the brain. That is, the evolutionary origin might have come from sensations and primal emotions arising from [[sensory neuron|sensors]] and [[sensory receptors|receptors]], both internal and surface, signaling that the well-being of the creature was immediately threatened<U+2014>for example, hunger for air, thirst, hunger, pain, and extreme temperature change. This is based on neurological data showing the [[thalamus|thalamic]], [[hippocampus|hippocampal]], [[orbitofrontal cortex|orbitofrontal]], [[insular cortex|insula]], and [[midbrain]] sites are the key to consciousness of thirst.<ref name = Merker>Merker, B. (2007). Consciousness without a cerebral cortex: A challenge for neuroscience and medicine. ''Behavioral and Brain Sciences'', 30(01), 63<U+2013>81.</ref> These scientists also point out that the cortex might not be as important to primary consciousness as some neuroscientists have believed.<ref name = Merker/> Evidence of this lies in the fact that studies show that systematically disabling parts of the cortex in animals does not remove consciousness. Another study found that children born without a cortex are conscious. Instead of cortical mechanisms, these scientists emphasize brainstem mechanisms as essential to consciousness.<ref name = Merker/> Still, these scientists concede that higher order consciousness does involve the cortex and complex communication between different areas of the brain.
 
While animals with [[primary consciousness]] have long-term memory, they lack explicit narrative, and, at best, can only deal with the immediate scene in the remembered present. While they still have an advantage over animals lacking such ability, evolution has brought forth a growing complexity in consciousness, particularly in mammals. Animals with this complexity are said to have secondary consciousness.
Secondary consciousness is seen in animals with [[semantic]] capabilities, such as the four [[great apes]]. It is present in its richest form in the human species, which is unique in possessing complex [[language]] made up of [[syntax]] and semantics. In considering how the neural mechanisms underlying primary consciousness arose and were maintained during evolution, it is proposed that at some time around the divergence of [[reptiles]] into mammals and then into [[birds]], the [[embryological]] development of large numbers of new reciprocal connections allowed rich [[Reentry (neural circuitry)|re-entrant]] activity to take place between the more posterior brain systems carrying out perceptual categorization and the more frontally located systems responsible for value-category memory.<ref name="Edelman"/> The ability of an animal to relate a present complex scene to its own previous history of learning conferred an adaptive evolutionary advantage. At much later evolutionary epochs, further re-entrant circuits appeared that linked semantic and linguistic performance to categorical and conceptual [[memory]] systems. This development enabled the emergence of secondary consciousness.<ref name="Sky">Edelman, G. M. (2004). Wider than the sky: a revolutionary view of consciousness.

Ursula Voss of the [[Universit<U+00E4>t Bonn]] believes that the theory of [[protoconsciousness]]<ref>Hobson, J. A. (2009) [http://194.80.240.74/images/events/REM%20Sleep%20and%20Dreaming.pdf "REM sleep and dreaming: towards a theory of protoconsciousness''] ''Nature Reviews Neuroscience'', '''10''' (11), 803-U862. {{doi|10.1038/nrn2716}}</ref> may serve as adequate explanation for self-recognition found in birds, as they would develop secondary consciousness during REM sleep.<ref name="Voss">Voss, Ursula (2010) "Changes in EEG pre and post awakening". ''International Review of Neurobiology'', '''93''': 23<U+2013>56. {{doi|10.1016/S0074-7742(10)93002-X}}</ref> She added that many types of birds have very sophisticated language systems. Don Kuiken of the University of Alberta finds such research interesting as well as if we continue to study consciousness with animal models (with differing types of consciousness), we would be able to separate the different forms of reflectiveness found in today<U+2019>s world.<ref>Kuiken, Don (2010) [http://archiv.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/ojs/index.php/IJoDR/article/download/594/pdf_17 "Primary and secondary consciousness during dreaming"] ''International Journal of Dream Research'', '''3''' (1): 21<U+2013>25.</ref>

For the advocates of the idea of a secondary consciousness, [[self-recognition]] serves as a critical component and a key defining measure. What is most interesting then, is the evolutionary appeal that arises with the concept of self-recognition. In non-human species and in children, the [[mirror test]] (see above) has been used as an indicator of [[self-awareness]].

Convergent evidence indicates that non-human animals have the neuroanatomical, neurochemical, and neurophysiological substrates of conscious states along with the capacity to exhibit [[Intention|intentional behaviors]]. Consequently, the weight of evidence indicates that humans are not unique in possessing the [[neurological substrate]]s that generate consciousness. Non-human animals, including all mammals and birds, and many other creatures, including octopuses, also possess these neurological substrates.

In the accompanying text they "unequivocally" asserted:<ref name=CDC />

:* "The field of Consciousness research is rapidly evolving. Abundant new techniques and strategies for human and non-human animal research have been developed. Consequently, more data is becoming readily available, and this calls for a periodic reevaluation of previously held preconceptions in this field. Studies of non-human animals have shown that [[homology (biology)|homologous]] brain circuits correlated with conscious experience and perception can be selectively facilitated and disrupted to assess whether they are in fact necessary for those experiences. Moreover, in humans, new non-invasive techniques are readily available to survey the [[Neural correlates of consciousness|correlates of consciousness]]."<ref name=CDC />

:* "The [[neural substrate]]s of emotions do not appear to be confined to cortical structures. In fact, [[subcortical]] neural networks aroused during affective states in humans are also critically important for generating emotional behaviors in animals. Artificial arousal of the same brain regions generates corresponding behavior and feeling states in both humans and non-human animals. Wherever in the brain one evokes instinctual emotional behaviors in non-human animals, many of the ensuing behaviors are consistent with experienced feeling states, including those internal states that are rewarding and punishing. Deep brain stimulation of these systems in humans can also generate similar affective states. Systems associated with affect are concentrated in subcortical regions where neural [[Homology (biology)|homologies]] abound. Young human and non-human animals without neocortices retain these brain-mind functions. Furthermore, [[neural circuit]]s supporting behavioral/electrophysiological states of attentiveness, sleep and decision making appear to have arisen in evolution as early as the invertebrate radiation, being evident in insects and cephalopod mollusks (e.g., octopus)."<ref name=CDC />

:* "Birds appear to offer, in their behavior, neurophysiology, and neuroanatomy a striking case of [[parallel evolution]] of consciousness. Evidence of near human-like levels of consciousness has been most dramatically observed in [[African grey parrot]]s. Mammalian and avian emotional networks and cognitive microcircuitries appear to be far more homologous than previously thought. Moreover, certain species of birds have been found to exhibit neural [[sleep pattern]]s similar to those of mammals, including REM sleep and, as was demonstrated in [[zebra finch]]es, neurophysiological patterns, previously thought to require a mammalian neocortex. [[Magpie]]s in particular have been shown to exhibit striking similarities to humans, great apes, dolphins, and elephants in studies of [[Mirror test|mirror self-recognition]]."<ref name=CDC />
 
:* "In humans, the effect of certain [[hallucinogen]]s appears to be associated with a disruption in cortical [[Feedforward, Behavioral and Cognitive Science|feedforward]] and feedback processing. Pharmacological interventions in non-human animals with compounds known to affect conscious behavior in humans can lead to similar perturbations in behavior in non-human animals. In humans, there is evidence to suggest that awareness is correlated with cortical activity, which does not exclude possible contributions by subcortical or early cortical processing, as in visual awareness. Evidence that human and non-human animal emotional feelings arise from homologous subcortical brain networks provide compelling evidence for evolutionarily shared primal affective qualia."<ref name=CDC />

[[Irene Pepperberg]]'s research with captive [[African gray parrot]]s, most notably with a bird named [[Alex (parrot)|Alex]], has scientifically demonstrated they possess the ability to associate simple human words with meanings, and to intelligently apply the abstract concepts of shape, colour, number, zero-sense, etc. According to Pepperberg and other ornithologists, they perform many cognitive tasks at the level of dolphins, chimpanzees, and even human  [[toddlers]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7414846.stm |work=BBC News | title=Stray Japan parrot talks way home | date=22 May 2008 | accessdate=23 April 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100402002927/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7414846.stm| archivedate= 2 April 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Another notable African Grey is [[N'kisi]], which in 2004 was said to have a vocabulary of over 950 words which she used in creative ways.<ref>[http://www.sheldrake.org/nkisi/nkisi1_text.html Nkisi Audio Text 1]</ref> For example, when [[Jane Goodall]] visited N'kisi in his New York home, he greeted her with "Got a chimp?" because he had seen pictures of her with chimpanzees in Africa.<ref>[http://www.projo.com/ri/hopkinton/content/JANE_GOODALL08_05-08-08_RJA2H78_v81.37330d1.html]</ref>

A study published in 2011, led by Dalila Bovet of [[Paris West University Nanterre La D<U+00E9>fense]], demonstrated African Grey parrots were able to coordinate and collaborate with each other to an extent. They were able to solve problems set by scientists&mdash;for example, two birds could pull strings at the same time to obtain food. In another example, one bird stood on a perch to release a food-laden tray, while the other pulled the tray out from the test apparatus. Both would then feed. The birds in question were observed waiting for their partners to perform the necessary actions so their behaviour could be synchronized.  The parrots appeared to express individual preferences as to which of the other test birds they would work with.<ref name=gill>{{cite web |last=Gill |first=Victoria |title=Parrots choose to work together |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/12913981 |publisher=BBC Nature News |accessdate=19 May 2011 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110520092257/http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/12913981| archivedate=20 May 2011 |deadurl=no}}</ref>

[[File:Magpie samcem05.jpg|thumb|left|[[Magpie]] easily pass the [[mirror test]]]]

It was recently thought that self-recognition was restricted to mammals with large brains and highly evolved social cognition but absent from animals without a [[neocortex]]. However, in a recent study, an investigation of self-recognition in [[corvids]] was carried out, and significant result quantified the ability of self-recognition in the magpie. Mammals and birds inherited the same brain components from their last common [[ancestor]] nearly 300 million years ago, and have since independently evolved and formed significantly different brain types. The results of the mirror and mark tests showed that neocortex-less [[magpies]] are capable of understanding that a mirror image belongs to their own body. The findings show that magpies respond in the mirror and mark test in a manner similar to apes, dolphins and elephants. This is a remarkable capability that, although not fully concrete in its determination of self-recognition, is at least a prerequisite of self-recognition. This is not only of interest regarding the convergent evolution of social intelligence; it is also valuable for an understanding of the general principles that govern cognitive evolution and their underlying neural mechanisms. The magpies were chosen to study based on their empathy/ lifestyle, a possible precursor for their ability of self-awareness.<ref name="Magpie"/>
