'''''Hippocampus paradoxus''''', or Paradoxical seahorse, is a [[pygmy seahorse]] in the genus [[Seahorse|Hippocampus]]. The only known specimen was captured in 1995 and remained unnoticed in a museum until 2006.<ref name = "Daily mail">{{Cite web | title = New species of seahorse found... after sitting in a museum for more than a decade | publisher = Daily Mail | url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-1357950/Hippocampus-paradoxus-New-species-seahorse-found.html}}</ref>

==Description==
The species name ''paradoxus'' was given because the seahorse is very different from all of the other members of genus [[Seahorse|''Hippocampus'']]; the seahorse is [[paradox|paradoxical]].<ref name = "Daily mail">{{Cite web | title = New species of seahorse found... after sitting in a museum for more than a decade | publisher = Daily Mail | url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-1357950/Hippocampus-paradoxus-New-species-seahorse-found.html}}</ref> It is most closely related to another pygmy seahorse in its genus,  ''[[Hippocampus minotaur]]''. Like all [[seahorse|seahorses]], this species is [[sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]]. It is theorized that the brood pouch is attached on the ventral side  of the seahorse, near the top of the tail and connecting to the sea seahorse's chest. This theory is based on its similarity to ''[[Hippocampus minotaur]]'', but has not been confirmed because a male specimen has not been collected.<ref name = "Discovery of new seahorse">{{Cite web | last = Foster | first = Ralph | last = Gomon | first = Martin | title = A new seahorse (Teleostei: Syngnathidae: Hippocampus)

The only known specimen is a female, and has a vertical height of 6.5 cm.<ref name = "fishbase">{{FishBase |genus= Hippocampus |species= paradoxus |month= February |year= 2015}}</ref> This species has 8 trunk rings and 11 pectoral [[lepidotrichia|fin rays]]. A series of lobes that resemble small fins make up the majority of this fish's body. The lobes start near the mid-line of the seahorse's trunk and continue to the end of the seahorse's tail. The first lobe does resemble a small dorsal fin, but it is not one. Unlike all of the other members of its genus, this species of seahorse lacks a [[dorsal fin]].<ref name = "Discovery of new seahorse">{{Cite web | last = Foster | first = Ralph | last = Gomon | first = Martin | title = A new seahorse (Teleostei: Syngnathidae: Hippocampus)

The [[holotype]] is yellow-cream in color, and it is covered with small brown spots. It is possible that the color of the specimen has changed while the body was preserved inside of [[formaldehyde]], so the actual color of this animal in the wild is unknown.<ref name = "Discovery of new seahorse">{{Cite web | last = Foster | first = Ralph | last = Gomon | first = Martin | title = A new seahorse (Teleostei: Syngnathidae: Hippocampus)

==Distribution==
The [[holotype]] was discovered south-west of [[Esperance, Western Australia]], on the western periphery of the [[Great Australian Bight]].<ref name = "Daily mail">{{Cite web | title = New species of seahorse found... after sitting in a museum for more than a decade | publisher = Daily Mail | url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-1357950/Hippocampus-paradoxus-New-species-seahorse-found.html}}</ref> The exact coordinates of the specimen's collection was near {{Coord|34|12|S|121|32|E}}.<ref name = "Discovery of new seahorse">{{Cite web | last = Foster | first = Ralph | last = Gomon | first = Martin | title = A new seahorse (Teleostei: Syngnathidae: Hippocampus)

==Habitat==
This species was collected at a depth near 102 m (335 ft). The collection site was in the benthic zone, at the bottom of the ocean, near the substrate (which in this case was sand). The collection site was full of different types [[Bryozoa|bryozoans]], such as lace corals and sponges. Waters at the collection site are relatively warm.<ref name = "Discovery of new seahorse">{{Cite web | last = Foster | first = Ralph | last = Gomon | first = Martin | title = A new seahorse (Teleostei: Syngnathidae: Hippocampus)
