==History==
The company has grown rapidly since its founding in June 1997, thanks in part to its investment in [[search engine technology]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.httpuseragent.org/list/YoudaoBot+1.0-n742.htm |title=Netease Search Engine - Youdao/yodao spider |publisher=Httpuseragent.org |date=2008-12-31 |accessdate=2012-08-17}}</ref> and [[MMOG|massively multiplayer online gaming]].
