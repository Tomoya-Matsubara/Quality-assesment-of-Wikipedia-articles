'''George Douglas Howard Cole''' ([[25 September]] [[1889]] &ndash; [[14 January]] [[1959]]) was an [[England|English]] [[political theorist]], [[economist]], and [[historian]].  As a [[libertarian socialist]] he was a long-time member of the [[Fabian Society]] and an advocate for the [[Cooperative|cooperative movement]].  He and his wife Margaret Cole (1893-1980) together wrote many popular detective stories, featuring the investigators Superintendent Wilson, Everard Blatchington and Dr Tancred.

Cole was educated at [[St Paul's School]] and [[Balliol College, Oxford]]. 

As a [[conscientious objector]] during [[World War I|World War One]], the campaign against [[conscription]] introduced Cole to a co-worker, [[Margaret Postgate]], whom he married in 1918. The couple both worked for the Fabian Society for the next six years before moving to [[Oxford]], where Cole started writing for the ''[[Manchester Guardian]]''. During these years, he also authored several economic and historical works including biographies of [[William Cobbett]] and [[Robert Owen]]. In 1925, he became reader in [[economics]] at [[University College, Oxford]]. In 1944, Cole became the first [[Chichele Professor of Social and Political Theory]] at Oxford.  He was succeeded in the chair by [[Isaiah Berlin]] in 1957.

== Socialism ==

Cole became interested in Fabianism while studying at [[Balliol College, Oxford]]. He joined the Fabian Society's executive under the sponsorship of [[Sidney Webb]].  Cole became a principal proponent of [[Guild Socialism|Guild Socialist]] ideas, a [[libertarian socialist]] alternative to [[Marxist]] [[political economy]]. These ideas he put forward in ''[[The New Age]]'' before and during the [[World War I|First World War]], and also in the pages of [[New Statesman|The New Statesman]], the weekly founded by the [[Beatrice Webb|Webbs]] and [[George Bernard Shaw]].

Cole said his interest in socialism was kindled by his reading ''[[News from Nowhere]],'' the [[utopian]] novel by [[William Morris]].  He wrote,
<blockquote>
I became a Socialist because, as soon as the case for a society of equals, set free from the twin evils of riches and poverty, mastership and subjection, was put to me, I knew that to be the only kind of society that could be consistent with human decency and fellowship and that in no other society could I have the right to be content.<U+201D><ref>[http://threescoreyearsandten.blogspot.com/2006/07/gdh-cole-and-root-of-matter.html   G. D. H Cole, "World Socialism Restated," pamphlet (1956), quoted by Margaret Cole, ''The Life of G. D. H. Cole,'' Macmillan/St. Martin's (1971); cited, Harry Barnes, ''Three Score Years and Ten'' (July 24, 2006).]</ref> </blockquote>

Neither a Marxist nor a Social Democrat, Cole envisioned a Socialism of decentralized association and active, participatory democracy, whose basic units would be sited at the workplace and in the community rather than in any central apparatus of the State.<ref>[http://www.marxists.org/archive/sedgwick/1980/xx/gdhcole.htm  Peter Sedgwick, "A Return to First Things", ''Balliol College Annual Record 1980,'' pp.86-88 (review of A. W. Wright, ''G.D.H. Cole and Socialist Democracy''). Marxists<U+2019> Internet Archive.  On line.]</ref>  

Cole was a powerful influence on the life of the young [[Harold Wilson]], whom he taught, worked with and convinced to join the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]].  Before him, [[Hugh Gaitskell]] was a student of G.D.H Cole.

==Co-operative studies==

Cole was also a theorist of the [[Cooperative|Co-operative movement,]] and has made a number of contributions to the fields of [[Co-operative studies]], [[Co-operative economics]] and the study of [[History of the Co-operative Movement|Co-operative History]]. In particular, his book "The British Co-operative Movement in a Socialist Society" examined the economic status of the English CWS (the predecessor of the modern [[Co-operative Group]]), evaluated its possibility of achieving a [[Co-operative Commonwealth(society)|Co-operative Commonwealth]] without State assistance, and hypothesised what the role of the [[Cooperative|Co-operative movement]] may be in a [[Socialist]] State.<ref>Cole, G.D.H., <U+201C>The British Co-operative Movement in a Socialist Society: A Report for the Fabian Society<U+201D>, London: George Allen & Unwin Ltd., 1951.</ref>

A second book, entitled "A Century of Co-operation," examined the history of the Co-operative movement, from the very first Co-operatives, to the contribution of the [[Chartism|Chartists]] and [[Robert Owen]], through to the [[Rochdale Pioneers]], as well as the movement's development (in Great Britain) over the following Century.<ref>Cole, G.D.H., <U+201C>A Century of Co-operation<U+201D>, Oxford: George Allen & Unwin Ltd., 1944.</ref>

==Trivia==
* From the Minutes of [[Oxford University Labour Club]]'s Termly General Meeting of [[Michaelmas term]] 1926 (held [[10 December]]): 
:"after the interval, members of the club performed a scurrilous, libellous, treasonable and blasphemous operetta for which Mr GDH Cole was responsible. The club entered into the spirit of the production and enjoyed itself very much".

* G. D. H. Cole was uncle to [[Oliver Postgate]], creator of children's TV programme Bagpuss.  Professor Yaffle, the woodpecker in  [[Bagpuss]] was based on Cole and philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]].<ref>Oliver Postgate, ''Seeing Things: An Autobiography,'' Sidgwick & Jackson (2000)
