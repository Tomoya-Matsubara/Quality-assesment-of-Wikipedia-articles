'''Brunswick''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|<U+02C8>|b|r|<U+028C>|n|z|w|<U+026A>|k}}) is the major urban and economic center in [[Colonial Coast|southeastern]] [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] in the United States. The municipality is located on a [[harbor]] near the [[Atlantic Ocean]], approximately 30 miles (50&nbsp;km) north of [[Florida]] and 70 miles (110&nbsp;km) south of [[South Carolina]]. Brunswick is bordered on the east by the [[Intracoastal Waterway|Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway]] which separates it from the [[The Golden Isles of Georgia|Golden Isles]]. It is the second-largest city on Georgia's coast, after [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]], and is the [[county seat|seat of government]] for [[Glynn County, Georgia|Glynn County]].

As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], the city had a population of 15,383 with a metropolitan population of 103,841.<ref name=popest2>{{cite web |url=http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/GCTTable?_bm=y&-geo_id=04000US13&-_box_head_nbr=GCT-T1&-ds_name=PEP_2009_EST&-_lang=en&-mt_name=PEP_2009_EST_GCTT1_ST9&-format=ST-9&-_sse=on |title=Population for all cities and towns in Georgia, 2000-2009 |accessdate=2011-02-07 |work=United States Census Bureau }}</ref><ref name=metro>{{cite web | title=Metropolitan and micropolitan statistical area population and estimated components of change: April 1, 2000 to July 1, 2009 | date=2010-03-23 | url =http://www.census.gov/popest/metro/files/2009/CBSA-EST2009-alldata.csv | work =United States Census Bureau | accessdate = 2010-03-29 }}</ref> The [[Brunswick metropolitan area|city's metropolitan area]] is the twelfth-largest in the state of Georgia and includes the counties of Glynn, [[Brantley County, Georgia|Brantley]], and [[McIntosh County, Georgia|McIntosh]].

The city traces its roots to its 1738 settlement as a tobacco plantation by [[British America|British]] colonists and a southern buffer to [[Spanish Florida]]. It came under [[Province of Georgia|provincial]] control in 1771 and was founded as ''Brunswick'' after the duchy of [[Brunswick-L<U+00FC>neburg]] in Germany, the ancestral home of the [[House of Hanover|Hanoverians]]. It was officially incorporated in 1856.

Brunswick is near [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]], Florida, and Savannah, Georgia. With a deepwater port, Brunswick supports thriving seafood and shipping industries. Naval stores, pulp and wood products, bulk cargoes, and tourism are prominent in the local economy. Additionally, the headquarters facility of the [[Federal Law Enforcement Training Center]] (FLETC) is located 5 miles (8&nbsp;km) north of the [[central business district]] of the city and is adjacent to [[Brunswick Golden Isles Airport]], which provides commercial air service to the region.

Two of these parishes<U+2014>St. David and St. Patrick<U+2014>would later be combined to form the mainland portion of Glynn County. Additionally, the 1765 act assigned Jekyll Island to St. James Parish, meaning that this parish consisted entirely of St. Simons and Jekyll islands. On February 5, 1777, the state's first constitution was adopted. Article IV of that document transformed the existing colonial parishes into seven counties, with Native American-ceded lands to the north forming an eighth county. Glynn County, which was seventh on the list and thus is considered Georgia's seventh county, consisted of all of St. David and St. Patrick parishes. In 1789 the legislature added St. Simons and Jekyll islands to Glynn County. Frederica on St. Simons Island served as Glynn County's seat beginning in 1789, at the absorption of the islands into Glynn. In an act of February 10, 1787, Georgia's legislature provided that Glynn County's courthouse and jail be erected and that county elections be held in Brunswick<U+2014>which made it the county seat. Ten years later<U+2014>on February 13, 1797<U+2014>the legislature formally designated Brunswick the seat of Glynn County.

At the end of the eighteenth century, a large tract of land surrounding Brunswick on three sides had been laid off and designated as Commons.<ref name=ourtodaysandyesterdays/> Commissioners were named in 1796 to support these efforts.<ref name=ourtodaysandyesterdays/> The General Assembly authorized them to sell 500 acres of Commons; one-half of the proceeds to go to the construction of the courthouse and jail and one-half to the support of the academy.<ref name=ourtodaysandyesterdays/> In 1819 the commissioners erected a comfortable building for school purposes on the southeastern corner of Reynolds and L streets.<ref name=ourtodaysandyesterdays/> This was the first public building in Brunswick.<ref name=oldtownbwkpahistory/> It was abandoned four years later, but a new building was erected on Hillsborough Square in 1840 using Commons proceeds.<ref name=ourtodaysandyesterdays/> A courthouse and jail were built around this time.<ref name=ourtodaysandyesterdays/><ref name=gccourthousedlg/><ref name=oldtownbwkpahistory/> The town was officially incorporated as a city on February 22, 1856.<ref name=oldtownbwkpahistory/><ref name=oglethorpe>{{cite web |url=http://www.brunswickga.org/ |title=Official website of the City of Brunswick |accessdate=2009-05-25 |work=City of Brunswick }}</ref> By 1860 Brunswick had a population of 468, a bank, a weekly newspaper, and a sawmill which employed nine workers.<ref name=oldtownbwkpahistory>{{cite web | title=History of Brunswick, Georgia | publisher=Todd Gwynn | url =http://www.glynncounty.com/brunswick/history.shtml | work =Old Town Brunswick Preservation Association | accessdate = 2011-02-15 }}</ref>

Brunswick was abandoned during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] when citizens were ordered to evacuate. The city, like many others in the [[Southern United States|South]], suffered from post-war depression. After one of the nation<U+2019>s largest lumber mills began operation on nearby St. Simons Island, economic prosperity returned. Rail lines were constructed from Brunswick to inland Georgia, and, unlike many other southern cities during the [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] period, Brunswick experienced an [[boom and bust|economic boom]].

[[Image:Glynn County in 1864.PNG|thumb|left|An 1864 map of Brunswick and the surrounding area.]]
In 1878, poet and native Georgian [[Sidney Lanier]], who sought relief from [[tuberculosis]] in Brunswick<U+2019>s climate, wrote ''[[The Marshes of Glynn]]'', a poem based on the [[salt marsh]]es that span across Glynn County. The December 1888 issue of ''[[Harper's Weekly]]'' predicted that "Brunswick by the Sea" was destined to become the "winter [[Newport, Rhode Island|Newport]] of America." [[Jekyll Island]] had become a resort destination for some of the era's most influential families (most notably [[Rockefeller family|Rockefeller]]s, [[Vanderbilt family|Vanderbilt]]s, [[Pulitzer]]s and [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company|Goodyear]]s) who arrived by train or yacht.

A [[yellow fever]] epidemic began in 1893 which heralded a decade of hardships for the city; it was flooded in 1893 when a modern-day [[Saffir<U+2013>Simpson Hurricane Scale#Category 3|Category 3]] hurricane (today known as the [[1893 Sea Islands Hurricane|Sea Islands Hurricane]]) paralleled the coast of Georgia before hitting [[South Carolina]].

In [[World War II]], Brunswick served as a strategic military location. German U-boats threatened the coast of the [[southern United States]], and [[blimp]]s became a common sight as they patrolled the coastal areas. During the war, blimps from Brunswick<U+2019>s [[Naval Air Station Glynco]] (at the time, the largest blimp base in the world) safely escorted almost 100,000 ships without a single vessel lost to enemy submarines.<ref>{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=Blimps Over Brunswick | date= | publisher= | url =http://www.glynncounty.com/cgi-bin/oaktree.pl?ID=00013472 | work =GlynnCounty.com | pages = | accessdate = 2008-12-27 | language = }}</ref>

In World War II, Brunswick boomed as over 16,000 workers of the [[J.A. Jones Construction|J.A.

=== Topography ===
[[File:Brunswick satellite map.jpg|thumb|right|A simulated-color satellite image of Brunswick.]]
Brunswick is located in the [[southeastern United States]], in southeastern [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], approximately halfway between [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]] and [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]]. The city is located at the apex of the bight of the Georgia coast, the westernmost point on the [[East Coast of the United States|Atlantic seaboard]], and is naturally sheltered by two barrier islands, [[Jekyll Island|Jekyll]] and [[St. Simons, Georgia|St. Simons]].

Brunswick uses the [[city commission government|city commission]] model of [[local government|municipal government]].<ref name=citycommission/> The city commission consists of five individuals elected on a [[plurality-at-large voting|plurality-at-large]] basis. Commissioners constitute the [[legislature|legislative body]] of the city and, as a group, are responsible for taxation, appropriations, ordinances, and other general functions. Individual commissioners are assigned responsibility for a specific aspect of municipal affairs. One commissioner is designated to function as [[mayor]].<ref>{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Commission form of city government | date= | publisher= | url =http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/CC/moc1.html | work =Handbook of Texas Online | pages = | accessdate = 2008-09-21 | language = }}</ref> The mayor of Brunswick is [[Bryan Thompson (politician)|Bryan Thompson]] who was first elected in 2005.<ref>{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Brunswick to Choose Mayor | date= | publisher=[[WTLV]]/[[WJXX]] | url =http://www.firstcoastnews.com/news/local/news-article.aspx?storyid=46906 | work =First Coast News | pages = | accessdate = 2008-09-21 | language = }}</ref>

The city is divided into two wards with each ward electing two city commission representatives. The mayor serves as an [[at-large]] commissioner and [[chair (official)|chairperson]].

The main duty of the manager is to oversee policy set by the city commission on a daily basis. The city manager is to see that all laws, provisions of the [[municipal corporation|city charter]], and any acts of the city commission are executed and enforced. The city manager of Brunswick is Roosevelt Harris, Jr.<ref name=brunswickga.org/>
