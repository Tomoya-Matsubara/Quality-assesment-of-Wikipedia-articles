'''Bradford City Association Football Club'''<U+2014>also known informally as [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City]], or just "City"<U+2014>are an English [[association football|football]] club founded in [[Bradford]] in [[1903 in association football|1903]] to introduce the sport to the [[West Riding of Yorkshire]], which until then had been almost entirely inclined towards [[rugby league]]. Before they had even played their first game, City were elected to [[The Football League]] to replace [[Doncaster Rovers F.C.|Doncaster Rovers]] in [[Football League Second Division|Division Two]], and took over the [[Valley Parade]] stadium, which has been their permanent home ground ever since. The club achieved early success by winning the Division Two title in 1908 and the [[FA Cup]] in [[1911 FA Cup Final|1911]], both under the management of [[Peter O'Rourke]], before they were [[promotion and relegation|relegated]] from [[Football League First Division|Division One]] in [[1921-22 in English football|1921&ndash;22]].

City suffered a second relegation five seasons later, but when O'Rourke was reappointed as manager before the [[1928-29 in English football|1928&ndash;29]] season, they broke several club records to earn promotion back to Division Two. After eight seasons in Division Two, City returned to Division Three, and they remained in the third and fourth tiers of the [[English football league system]] until [[1985-86 in English football|1985&ndash;86]]. During that time, they endured several periods of financial hardship, and in 1985, their ground suffered a disastrous [[Bradford City stadium fire|fire]] in which 56&nbsp;people died, on a day the club and their fans were supposed to be celebrating success on the field.

In [[1987-88 in English football|1987&ndash;88]], the club came close to returning to the top division when they missed out on promotion on the final day of the season. However, following relegation back to [[Football League Third Division|Division Three]], it was not until [[Geoffrey Richmond]] became chairman in January 1994 that the club's fortunes were lifted. He helped to take the club to their first appearance at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]] and subsequently into the [[Premier League]], where they played for two seasons. Following Richmond's self-proclaimed "six weeks of madness" and the collapse of television channel [[ITV Digital]], the club suffered its first spell in [[administration (insolvency)|administration]]. Another period under administration has followed, and City have dropped through the leagues of professional English football back to the [[Football League Two|bottom tier]] of The Football League.
