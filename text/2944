==Background==
John Albert Taylor was born in [[Ogden, Utah]] to Albert and Gaylene Taylor, who separated during his infancy. He moved several times during his youth, such as [[Colorado]] at the age of nine, and said he was told that his father had died.<ref name="DeseretNews-19920316-stop">{{cite news|last=DeVoy|first=Beverly|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/215749/STOP-APPEALS-AND-GO-AHEAD-WITH-EXECUTION-INMATE-SAYS.html|title=Stop appeals and go ahead with execution, inmate says|newspaper=[[Deseret News]]|pages=1<U+2013>2|accessdate=2010-10-12|date=1992-03-16}}</ref> According to Taylor, he was raised in Florida, where he was abused as a child and became involved in drugs by his teens. Taylor stated that he did not get along with his stepfather, a [[Vietnam veteran]], or his mother: "But she could never control me. My mother had a lot of animosity toward my father. They alienated me for a long time. I was the whipping post." At the age of 13, he stabbed his stepfather.<ref name="DeseretNews-19960126-knew" /><ref name="DeseretNews-19891219-abuser">{{cite news|last=DeVoy|first=Beverly|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/77518/TAYLOR-WAS-SEX-ABUSER-HALF-SISTER-SAYS-CONVICT-SPENT-3-YEARS-IN-FLORIDA-PROGRAM-AS-A-TEEN-JUDGE-TOLD-AT-HEARING.html|title=Taylor was a sex abuser, half-sister says convict spent 3 years in Florida program as a teen, judge told at hearing|newspaper=[[Deseret News]]|accessdate=2010-10-04|date=1989-12-19}}</ref> According to court records, he repeatedly [[rape]]d his sister Laurie during his teens, assaulted other young girls, and was [[involuntary commitment|committed]] to a [[sex offender]] program.<ref name="DeseretNews-19891219-abuser" /><ref name="DeseretNews-19891220-death">{{cite news|last=DeVoy|first=Beverly|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/77530/TAYLOR-RECEIVES-DEATH-SENTENCE.html|title=Taylor receives death sentence|newspaper=[[Deseret News]]|accessdate=2010-10-03|date=1989-12-20}}</ref> In 1974, Taylor moved back to Ogden to live with his grandmother, but soon returned to Florida.<ref name="DeseretNews-19920316-stop" />

==Death of Charla King==
At around 3:20 p.m. on June 23, 1989, Sherron King returned from work to her apartment in [[Washington Terrace, Utah]] to find the body of her daughter Charla in the bedroom with a nightgown wrapped around her head and panties stuffed in her mouth. After calling the police, she was instructed to perform [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]] and discovered that Charla had been [[strangulation|strangled]] to death with a telephone cord. Charla's [[foster care|foster]] grandmother Bertha Poster stated that she had dropped Charla off at the apartment at about 1:30 p.m. after visiting the mall.

===Arrest===
On June 25, a tipster, who was later revealed to be Taylor's sister Laurie Galli,<ref name="DeseretNews-19891219-abuser" /> contacted Washington Terrace Police officer Marsha Gathercole with information connected to the murder.<ref name="DeseretNews-19891128-testifies" /> Taylor's [[fingerprint]]s were found on a telephone in the King residence and matched to records provided by authorities in [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida|Fort Lauderdale]]. He was arrested at about 9 p.m. on June 28 at the home of his half-sister Tresa Taylor in [[Ogden, Utah]] and charged with first-degree murder the next morning.

Sherron King moved out of the apartment complex on June 28. She was upset that the neighbors who came forward as witnesses did nothing when they heard her daughter screaming.<ref name="DeseretNews-19951231-pitied">{{cite news|last=Donaldson|first=Amy|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/459330/I-THINK-HE-NEEDS-TO-BE-PITIED.html|title='I think he needs to be pitied'|newspaper=[[Deseret News]]|pages=1<U+2013>3|accessdate=2010-10-02|date=1995-12-31}}</ref>

===Murder trial===
On November 27, 1989, the trial commenced under District Judge David Roth after Taylor [[jury trial#Waiver of jury trial|waived his right to a jury]]. Taylor testified on his own behalf that he only entered the apartment in the act of burglary while no one was home, leaving his fingerprints on the phone when he found money underneath it. [[Weber County, Utah|Weber County]] deputy attorney William Daines stated that Taylor previously denied being in the apartment and that two witnesses placed him at the scene at the time of the crime.<ref name="DeseretNews-19891128-testifies" /><ref name="DeseretNews-19951231-pitied" /> Prison inmate Mike Gallegos testified that he had a brief conversation in which Taylor told him that he killed a girl by accident.<ref name="DeseretNews-19891202-admitted">{{cite news|last=DeVoy|first=Beverly|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/75307/OGDEN-DEFENDANT-ADMITTED-KILLING-A-GIRL-INMATE-SAYS.html|title=Ogden defendant admitted killing a girl, inmate says|newspaper=[[Deseret News]]|accessdate=2010-10-03|date=1989-12-02}}</ref> Duane Moyes and James Gaskill of the [[Weber State College]] crime laboratory testified that the person who cut the telephone cord with a knife and wrapped it around the neck of the victim was likely the same as the one who left behind fingerprints on the phone. Lab director Gaskill stated that the prints, three of which were matched to fingers on Taylor's left hand, were the only evidence that placed Taylor at the crime scene. Gaskill said there was no evidence in the apartment to indicate a burglary took place or that any other person was connected to the murder.<ref name="DeseretNews-19891201-prints">{{cite news|last=DeVoy|first=Beverly|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/75130/PRINTS-ON-PHONE-AND-CORD-ARE-SIMILAR-LAB-EXPERT-SAYS.html|title=Prints on phone and cord are similar, lab expert says|newspaper=[[Deseret News]]|accessdate=2010-10-03|date=1989-12-01}}</ref>

Roth said that the facts of the case outweighed any mitigating circumstances.<ref name="DeseretNews-19891220-death" /> Taylor's father Albert attended most of his son's court proceedings until he died of heart failure on October 8, 1990.

He earned his [[General Educational Development|high school diploma]] and studied to be a [[paralegal]] until his educational [[grant (money)|grant money]] ran out.<ref name="DeseretNews-19960126-knew" />

In October 1995, Taylor decided to end further appeals after the Utah Supreme Court rejected his argument that his legal counsel was ineffective.<ref name="DeseretNews-19960126-knew" /> He fired defense attorney Ed Brass, stating: "If I don't fight for my appeal, I don't need an attorney."<ref name="DeseretNews-20100109-picks">{{cite news|last=DeVoy|first=Beverly|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/455576/11-YEAR-OLDS-KILLER-PICKS-DEATH-BY-FIRING-SQUAD.html|title=11-year-old's killer picks death by firing squad|newspaper=[[Deseret News]]|accessdate=2010-10-03|date=1995-12-09}}</ref> Taylor said he was prepared to die partly because of his failing health, including an [[enlarged heart]], [[upper gastrointestinal bleeding|bleeding]] [[peptic ulcer|ulcers]], and [[water retention (medicine)|swollen]] legs and feet.<ref name="DeseretNews-19960126-knew" />

{{quote|I don't want to die alone in my cell.|John Albert Taylor|December 1995<ref name="DeseretNews-19960126-knew" />}}

Judge Roth ordered Taylor to choose a method of execution.<ref name="DeseretNews-19911123-set" /> Taylor chose to be [[execution by firing squad|executed by firing squad]] to make the process more difficult for Utah state officials. In an interview with the ''[[Deseret News]]'', he stated: "I didn't commit the murder, and I'm not going to submit to letting them kill me on that table." Regarding the option of [[lethal injection]], Taylor said, "I don't want to go flipping around like a fish out of water on that table."<ref name="DeseretNews-20100109-picks" />

Five police officers, who volunteered to carry out the execution, were each paid $300.<ref name="PPG-19960126-awaiting" /> The shooters used identical [[Winchester Model 94]] rifles. One prison official selected each rifle at random from a table and handed them to another prison official sitting in a small room, out of sight. The second prison official would then load the rifle, and return it to the table. Four of the rifles were loaded with live ammunition. One was secretly loaded with a [[wax bullet]] so that none of the officers would be certain that they fired a deadly shot.<ref name="BBC-20100618-why" /> The non-lethal cartridge was tested to ensure that the [[report (noise)|report]] and [[recoil]] was difficult to distinguish from a real cartridge.<ref name="DeseretNews-20100427-commemorative">{{cite news|last=Liesik|first=Geoff|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/700027698/Corrections-creating-commemorative-coin-for-Ronnie-Lee-Gardner-execution.html|title=Corrections creating commemorative coin for Ronnie Lee Gardner execution|newspaper=[[Deseret News]]|pages=1<U+2013>2|accessdate=2010-10-02|date=2010-04-27}}</ref>
