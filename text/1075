The '''UNC-Duke rivalry''' is a fierce [[rivalry]], particularly in men's college basketball, between [[Duke Blue Devils|Duke University]] and the [[North Carolina Tar Heels|University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] ("UNC") athletic teams.  Considered one of the most intense rivalries in all of sports, a non-scientific poll conducted by [[ESPN]] in 2000 ranked the basketball rivalry as the third greatest North American sports rivalry of all-time.<ref  name="ESPNBEST">[http://espn.go.com/endofcentury/s/other/bestrivalries.html The 10 Greatest Rivalries] "ESPN." 3 Jan 2000.</ref> The intensity of the rivalry is augmented by the proximity of the two universities, located only eight miles apart, and the dissimilar funding structures of the schools, with Duke being privately funded and North Carolina a state-supported school. 

Battling it out at least twice a year since 1920, Duke and North Carolina routinely rank among the nation's best teams.  The games frequently determine the [[Atlantic Coast Conference]] champion - Duke and UNC have combined for 79% of the regular season titles and 58% of the tournament titles in the 53-year history of the conference.  The final game of the regular season alternates between [[Durham, North Carolina|Durham]] and [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina|Chapel Hill]] and has been played in the historic [[Cameron Indoor Stadium]] since 1940 and the multi-purpose [[Dean Smith Center]] since 1986. Duke has won three [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA championships]] and has been in fourteen [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship#Final Four|Final Fours]], while North Carolina has won four NCAA championships and has appeared in sixteen Final Fours (the team was awarded another national championship by the [[Helms Athletic Foundation]] in 1936 for their undefeated 1924 season). 

==History==
[[Image:DukeUNC2006-2.JPG|thumb|left|250px|The March 4, 2006 game was the most watched college basketball game in [[ESPN]] history.]]
Though the two schools had always had the contempt born of familiarity and proximity, some of its earliest roots of contemptuousness occurred in the early 1960's when Duke star and eventual National Player Of The Year Art Heyman got into a brawl on the court with North Carolina's [[Larry Brown (basketball)|Larry Brown]] which resulted in suspensions for both players. The rivalry reached unprecedented heights in the mid 1980's under head coaches [[Mike Krzyzewski]] of Duke and [[Dean Smith]] of UNC, thanks to the emergence of cable channels such as [[ESPN]] and the increasing coverage of the ACC in national broadcasts by the three major networks, giving a vast national audience more opportunities to witness the two teams and their coaches.

Smith has the record for most wins by a men's college basketball coach, with 879 wins against only 254 losses.  In [[1982 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1982]], with players [[Michael Jordan]], [[Sam Perkins]] and [[James Worthy]], he won his first national championship. 
Krzyzewski was hired as head coach of [[Duke University]] in 1981. He led Duke to five consecutive [[Final Four|Final Fours]], including championships in [[1991 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1991]] and [[1992 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1992]] behind [[Bobby Hurley]], [[Grant Hill (basketball)|Grant Hill]] and [[Christian Laettner]].  
North Carolina was not to be denied the spotlight, though, winning the championship under Dean Smith in [[1993 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1993]]. Since then, Duke won a third championship under Krzyzewski, in [[2001 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2001]].  The excellence at Duke and UNC put both coaches in the [[Basketball Hall of Fame]].  

After Smith's retirement in 1997, Duke began to get the upper hand in the rivalry while North Carolina had to deal with three coaching changes (from Dean Smith to [[Bill Guthridge]] to [[Matt Doherty]] to [[Roy Williams (coach)|Roy Williams]]) between 1997-2003.  From 1997-2003 UNC won only 5 games of 19 against Duke and some said that the rivalry was on the decline.<ref>[http://espn.go.com/ncb/columns/doyel_gregg/1503875.html]</ref> However, with the arrival of UNC alumnus Roy Williams as head coach, North Carolina has once again become a top basketball program.  Williams led UNC to its fourth  national championship in [[2005 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2005]], and the rivalry remains as heated as ever.

Former ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' editor and author Will Blythe argues that the rivalry<U+2019>s passion can be attributed greatly to class and culture in the South.<ref name="blythe">[http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/product-description/006074023X?n=283155].</ref>
Blythe writes that "[t]o legions of otherwise reasonable adults, it is a conflict that surpasses sports; it is locals against outsiders, elitists against populists, even good against evil [...] the rivalry may be a way of aligning oneself with larger philosophic ideals -- of choosing teams in life -- a tradition of partisanship that reveals the pleasures and even the necessity of hatred."<ref name="blythe">[http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/product-description/006074023X?n=283155].</ref>

==UNC-Duke rivalry in other areas==
There is also a less intense football rivalry between the two schools over the Victory Bell.  This rivalry has been less intense recently due to the fact that both schools have not typically fielded competitive football teams. However, UNC has dominated Duke by winning 16 of the last 17 meetings with Duke and now owns a 53-36-4 advantage in the all-time series between the intrastate rivals. Also recently, many consider North Carolina's main football rivals to be NC State.

The rivalry between Duke and North Carolina has spilled over into other arenas.  Recently, the rivalry has sparked the creation of the [[Carlyle Cup]].  This Cup is given each year to the school that has the most wins in a variety of sports over the other school.<ref>[http://www.carlylecup.com/ Website about the Carlyle Cup]</ref> 

Duke and North Carolina have also developed a strong women's college basketball rivalry since the 1990's.  It is not as intense as the men's basketball rivalry, and it is also overshadowed by more prestigious women's basketball rivalries, such as the rivalry between [[UConn-Tennessee rivalry|Connecticut and Tennessee]].  Nevertheless, Duke and North Carolina field two of the strongest women's basketball teams in the [[Atlantic Coast Conference|ACC]].  Duke made four Women's Final Four appearances in 1999, 2002, 2003, and 2006.  North Carolina won its first [[NCAA Women's Division I Basketball Championship]] in 1994, and made two Women's Final Four appearances in 1994 and 2006. 

Twenty four students from the two schools got together from January 14-16, 2006 in order to attempt to break the world record for the longest continuous game of basketball ever recorded. The game set a new world record at 57 hours, 17 minutes and 41 seconds with Duke winning the game 3699-3444. All $60,000 raised from the marathon benefited the Hoop Dreams Basketball Academy <ref>[http://www.hoop-dreams.net Hoop-Dreams website]</ref>, an organization which helps children with life-threatening illnesses develop successful life skills through basketball.
