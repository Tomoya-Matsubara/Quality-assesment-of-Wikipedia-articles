==History==
The site of the building was originally that of the [[Assay office#US assay offices|United States Assay Office]], what was the last public gold refinery in the United States.<ref name=nytimes_assay>{{cite news|last1=Shenon|first1=Philip|title=U.S. ASSAY OFFICE SITE SOLD DOWNTOWN FOR $27 MILLION|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/21/nyregion/us-assay-office-site-sold-downtown-for-27-million.html|accessdate=August 25, 2014|work=The New York Times|date=July 21, 1983}}</ref> The Assay Office also was responsible for incinerating damaged paper money and melting damaged coins. In 1983 the [[United States Mint]] put the {{convert|42,176|sqft|m2}} property up for auction. Beginning at $3 million, the winning bid was made by HRO International Ltd., a New York realty developer, at $27 million. The sale established it as the most valuable government estate sold at public auction.<ref name=nytimes_assay /> The Assay office building was subsequently demolished in 1986.<ref name=therealdeal>{{cite web|last1=Pincus|first1=Adam|title=1983: Top prices for auctioned government-owned parcels|url=http://therealdeal.com/issues_articles/this-month-in-real-estate-history-32/|website=therealdeal.com|accessdate=August 29, 2014}}</ref>

In 1987, HRO built the 36-floor building that stands today, naming the 23-43 Old Slip property One Financial Square.<ref name=emporis /><ref name=therealdeal /> The Paramount Group purchased the property for $135 million in 1995,<ref>{{cite web|last1=Wellborn|first1=Mark|title=Sale of One Financial Square Closes for $751 M|url=http://observer.com/2007/09/sale-of-one-financial-square-closes-for-751-m/|website=[[New York Observer]]|accessdate=29 August 2014}}</ref> then in August 2007 sold it to Beacon Capital Partners for $751 million,<ref name=therealdeal /> one of the largest sales on record of an office building in Lower Manhattan.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Stoler|first1=Michael|title=All Signs Pointing Up in Downtown Manhattan|url=http://www.nysun.com/real-estate/all-signs-pointing-up-in-downtown-manhattan/65237/|accessdate=August 29, 2014|work=[[The New York Sun]]|date=October 25, 2007}}</ref>

Like many buildings in [[Lower Manhattan]], 32 Old Slip was battered with storm waters during [[Hurricane Sandy]] in 2012. In contrast to most in the region, the building was designed to resist a powerful earthquake, which in part made the structure less prone to flooding.<ref name=crainsnewyork>{{cite web|last1=Geiger|first1=Daniel|title=32 Old Slip lands second big tenant in month|url=http://www.crainsnewyork.com/data-lists/real-estate-deal-watch/details/12/2864362|website=crainsnewyork.com|accessdate=29 August 2014}}</ref> Within a year, the building's market value fell 21.6% to a total $65.7 million.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Pincus|first1=Adam|title=Goldman Sachs HQ Is Worth $176 Million Less Now Than It Was Last Year|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/goldman-hq-worth-176m-less-2013-6|website=The Real Deal|publisher=[[Business Insider]]|accessdate=29 August 2014}}</ref> In 2013 a renovation effort began to add improved flood barriers, pumps and piping systems to better ward against future storms.<ref name=primary />

==Architecture==
The building is considered to be of a [[Postmodern architecture|postmodern]] architectural style. Four sides of [[granite]] and silver-tinted glass make up the base, which give way to stepped transitions, eventually folding to an [[octagonal]], entirely glass [[Curtain wall (architecture)|curtain wall]].<ref name=officespace_leader>{{cite web|title=32 Old Slip, One Financial Square|url=http://www.nyc-officespace-leader.com/32-old-slip-one-financial-square-leases-office-space-manhattan|website=nyc-officespace-leader.com|accessdate=August 29, 2014}}</ref>

The floor sizes range from 23,404 to 38,750 [[Real estate|rentable square feet]], totalling 1,161,435 rentable square feet overall.<ref name=primary /> It consists of columnless interior and a {{height|ft=40}} lobby.<ref name=officespace_leader /> There are 26 elevators in service and a parking garage beneath the structure.<ref name=primary /> The ground level side and rear of the building feature a privately owned [[Arcade (architecture)|arcade]] and urban plaza.<ref>{{cite web|title=Privately Owned Public Space|url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcp/html/priv/mndist1.shtml|website=nyc.gov|accessdate=August 29, 2014}}</ref>
