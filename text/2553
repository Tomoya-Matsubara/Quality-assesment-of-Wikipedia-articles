''BoxOfficeMojo.com''.]</ref> Though he is best known for his comedic roles, such as in the films ''[[Billy Madison]]'' (1995), ''[[Happy Gilmore]]'' (1996), ''[[Big Daddy (film)|Big Daddy]]'' (1999) and ''[[Mr. Deeds]]'' (2002), he has also had success in romantic and dramatic roles, such as in the films, ''[[The Wedding Singer]]'' (1998), ''[[Punch-Drunk Love]]'' (2002), ''[[Spanglish (film)|Spanglish]]'' (2004), and ''[[Reign Over Me]]'' (2007).

== Biography ==
===Early life===
Sandler was born in [[Brooklyn, New York]], the son of Judy, a nursery school teacher, and Stanley Sandler, an electrical engineer.<ref>[http://www.filmreference.com/film/70/Adam-Sandler.html "Adam Sandler Biography (1966?-)."] Film Reference.com.</ref> Sandler was raised [[Jew]]ish.<ref>[http://www.jewishjournal.com/arts/article/crazy_for_chanukah_20021129/ "Crazy for Chaukah."] ''JewishJournal.com''. November 29, 2002.</ref> When he was five, his family moved to [[Manchester, New Hampshire]], where he attended [[Manchester Central High School]]. He found he was a natural comic, and nurtured his talent while at [[New York University]] by performing regularly in clubs and on campuses. He graduated with a [[Bachelor of Fine Arts]] degree in 1991.

Later in his career, he would often draw on his earliest memories for material for his comedy and movies. The song "Lunchlady Land" is dedicated to Emalee, the lunchlady at Hayden Dining Hall at New York University. In the movie ''[[Click (film)|Click]]'', Sandler goes to [[Lake Winnipesaukee]], the largest lake in [[New Hampshire]], where he went to summer camp.

=== Acting career ===
In the mid to late 1980s, Sandler played Theo Huxtable's friend, Smitty, on ''[[The Cosby Show]]'' (1987<U+2013>1988). He was a performer for the [[Game show|MTV game show]] ''[[Remote Control (game show)|Remote Control]]'', on which he made appearances as the characters "Trivia Delinquent" or "Stud Boy". Early in his career, Sandler performed in comedy clubs, taking the stage at his brother's urging when he was only 17. He was discovered by comedian [[Dennis Miller]], who caught Sandler's act in Los Angeles. Miller recommended him to ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' producer [[Lorne Michaels]]. Sandler was hired as a writer for ''SNL'' in 1990 and became a featured player the following year, making a name for himself by performing amusing original songs on the show, including "[[The Chanukah Song]]".<ref>[http://www.biography.com/search/article.do?id=9542505 "Adam Sandler Biography."] ''Biography.com''.</ref> He left the show in 1995 to focus on his film career.

[[Image:Sandler reads ode to bob.png|thumb|Sandler reads 'An Ode to Bob' during a ''Price is Right'' appearance]]
Sandler's first starring role was in 1989, in the film ''[[Going Overboard]]''. In 1995, he starred in ''[[Billy Madison]]'', in which he plays a grown, though uneducated, man repeating grades 1<U+2013>12 to earn back his father's respect, along with the right to inherit his father's multi-million-dollar hotel empire. He followed this film with other financially successful comedies such as ''[[Bulletproof (1996 film)|Bulletproof]]'' (1996), ''[[Happy Gilmore]]'' (1996) and ''[[The Wedding Singer]]'' (1998). He was initially cast in the bachelor-party-themed comedy/thriller ''[[Very Bad Things]]'' (1998), but had to back out due to his involvement in ''[[The Waterboy]]'' (1998),<ref name="IMDB trivia">[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0124198/trivia "''Very Bad Things'' (1998) Trivia."] ''IMDB''.</ref> one of his first hits.

Although his earlier films did not receive critical praise, his more recent films, beginning with ''[[Punch-Drunk Love]]'' (2002), have received almost uniformly positive reviews. Some critics concluded that Sandler possessed considerably more acting ability that they believed had been previously wasted on poorly written scripts and characters with no development.<ref>Ebert, Roger. [http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20021018/REVIEWS/210180308/1023 "Punch-Drunk Love."] ''Chicago Sun-Times''. October 18, 2002.</ref> Audiences have remained faithful to Sandler's slapstick humor to the tune of US$100-million-plus grossing movies. Sandler has moved outside the genre of goofball humor to take on more serious parts such as the aforementioned ''[[Punch-Drunk Love]]'' (for which he was nominated for a [[Golden Globe]]),  ''[[Spanglish (film)|Spanglish]]'' (2004) and ''[[Reign Over Me]]'' (2007). He played a loving father figure in ''[[Big Daddy (film)|Big Daddy]]'' (1999). During filming, he met [[Jackie Sandler|Jacqueline Samantha Titone]] <U+2014> his future wife and mother of his daughter <U+2014> who was cast as the waitress from The Blarney Stone Bar.

At one point, Sandler was considered for the part that went to Jamie Foxx in ''[[Collateral (film)|Collateral]]'' (2004).<ref name="IMDB trivia"/> He also was one of the finalists along with [[Jim Carrey]] and [[Johnny Depp]] for the role of Willy Wonka in [[Tim Burton]]'s ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film)|Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]'' (2005).<ref name="IMDB trivia"/> He returned to more dramatic fare with [[Mike Binder]]'s ''[[Reign Over Me]]'' (2007), a drama about a man who loses his entire family in [[9/11]] and rekindles a friendship with his old college roommate (played by [[Don Cheadle]]). He starred in the film ''[[I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry]]'' (2007) alongside [[Kevin James]], as a New York City fireman pretending to be gay keep up an insurance scam so that his best friend's children can have benefits. Sandler's most recent film is ''[[You Don't Mess with the Zohan]]'' (2008), a comedy about a [[Mossad]] agent who fakes his own death and moves to the United States to become a hair stylist.  The film was written by Sandler, ''[[The 40-Year-Old Virgin]]'' writer-director [[Judd Apatow]] (who was an old roommate of Sandler's when both were starting out), and ''[[Triumph, the Insult Comic Dog]]'' creator [[Robert Smigel]], and was directed by ''Happy Gilmore'' director [[Dennis Dugan]].

"Like [[Will Ferrell]], Sandler has layers of tenderness under layers of irony under layers of tenderness &mdash; plus a floating anger like Jupiter<U+2019>s great red spot," wrote [[David Edelstein]] of ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine in a review of ''You Don't Mess with the Zohan''. "Some performers become stars because we can read them instantly, others &mdash; like Sandler &mdash; because we never tire of trying to get a fix on them."<ref>Edelstein, David, http://nymag.com/movies/reviews/47552/ "Israeli Stud, Aspiring Hairdresser: Adam Sandler makes his Jewish mother proud. Meanwhile, Werner Herzog tries to avoid penguins." ''New York'' magazine. June 5, 2008, accessed June 13, 2008.</ref>  

He recently finished production on ''[[Bedtime Stories (film)|Bedtime Stories]]'' (2008), a fantasy film directed by ''[[Bringing Down the House (film)|Bringing Down the House]]'' director [[Adam Shankman]], about a stressed real estate developer whose bedtime stories he reads to his niece and nephew begin to come true. This will mark Sandler's first family film and first film under the [[The Walt Disney Company|Walt Disney]] banner.<ref>[http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=19719 "Adam Sandler's Bedtime Stories Come True."] ''ComingSoon.net''.</ref> [[Keri Russell]] and English comedian [[Russell Brand]] co-star and the film is set to be released on Christmas of 2008.  

His next film will be Judd Apatow's third directorial feature ''[[Funny People]]''.  The film will star Sandler with [[Seth Rogen]] as a pair of stand up comedians. Filming was set to begin in mid-September 2008 with a tentative release date of July 31, 2009.<ref>{{cite news | author = Michael Fleming | title = Trio joins Judd Apatow film | publisher = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date = [[2008-06-11]] | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117987337.html?categoryid=13&cs=1 | accessdate=2008-06-13}}</ref> Other co-stars include [[Eric Bana]] and Apatow's wife, [[Leslie Mann]]. Sandler will play a more successful mentor of sorts to Rogen's character.<ref>[http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=45672 "In the Future with Seth Rogen."] ''ComingSoon.net''.</ref> The film will contain more dramatic elements than Apatow's previous efforts.<ref>[http://www.mtv.com/movies/news/articles/1588439/20080531/story.jhtml "Adam Sandler To Star In Judd Apatow Movie About Stand-Up Comics."] ''MTV''. May 31, 2008.</ref>

At one point, Sandler was in talks to star in [[Quentin Tarantino]]'s World War II film ''[[Inglourious Basterds]]'', which he confirmed, but he said he will not be in it due to a scheduling conflict with ''[[Funny People]]''.<ref>>{{cite web| url=http://www.rte.ie/arts/2008/0814/sandlera.html | title= Sandler won't star in Tarantino film}}</ref> In June 2007, it was announced that his production company, [[Happy Madison]], had made a preemptive acquisition for [[Mitch Albom]]'s screenwriting debut.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117967095.html?categoryid=13&cs=1 | title= Sandler struck by Albom pitch}}</ref>
