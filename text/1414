'''''Infinity on High''''' is the fourth studio album by American [[Rock music|rock]] band [[Fall Out Boy]], released on February 5, 2007 by [[Island Records]] as the follow-up to the band's commercially successful 2005 album ''[[From Under the Cork Tree]]''. It was recorded from July to October 2006 at the Pass Studios in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]] and mixed at the Paramount Recording Studios in [[Hollywood]]. The music was composed by lead singer and guitarist [[Patrick Stump]] and the lyrics were penned by bassist [[Pete Wentz]]. 

The album features collaborations with new producers and guest artists such as [[Babyface (musician)|Babyface]] and [[Jay-Z]], and sees the band experimenting with musical genres other than [[pop punk]] including [[R&B]], [[Soul music|soul]], and [[flamenco]].  The group also utilized instruments such as [[Horn (instrument)|horns]], [[Violin|violins]] and [[pianos]], which had not been used on previous releases.  As reported by ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', Fall Out Boy "drifts further from its hardcore punk roots to write increasingly accessible pop tunes," a slight departure from the group's previous sound.  Critics felt that the lyrics served as a response to the band's rise to fame. The group embarked on several tours to promote the album, including the Friends or Enemies Tour, the [[Honda Civic Tour]], and the [[Young Wild Things Tour]].  In the wake of the album's leak on the internet, the band included a live [[extended play]] with each purchase.

The album debuted at number one on the U.S. [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], selling 260,000 units in its first week, making it Fall Out Boy's first number one album and second top ten.  It also reached number one in [[New Zealand]] and immediately became a top ten album worldwide in countries including [[Canada]], the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Australia]]. Four of the album's fourteen songs were released as singles, of which three charted on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], lead by the lead single "[[This Ain't a Scene, It's an Arms Race]]" at number two.  The album was certified [[RIAA Certification |Platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) on March 12, one month after its release, for shipments of one million copies.  ''Infinity on High'' was ranked at number twenty-one on [[IFPI]]'s list of the "Top 50 Best Selling Albums of 2007".  The album received generally positive reviews from music critics, with many praising Stump's vocals and the album's new musical direction.

==Background==
After taking a two month long break following the band<U+2019>s Black Clouds and Underdogs tour in promotion of their 2005 album ''[[From Under the Cork Tree]]'', Fall Out Boy returned to the studio to begin work on their follow-up effort.<ref name="StumpIntAquarian">{{cite web|url=http://www.theaquarian.com/2006/12/27/fall-out-boy-interview-with-patrick-stump/|title=Fall Out Boy: Interview with Patrick Stump|last=Sciaretto|first=Amy|date=December 27, 2006|accessdate=May 14, 2011|work=The Aquarian Weekly|publisher=Diane Casazza, Chris Farinas}}</ref>  The band began writing songs for the new album while touring, and intended to quickly make a new album in order to keep momentum in the wake of the band<U+2019>s breakthrough success.<ref name="WayDifferent">{{cite web|url=http://www.vh1.com/news/articles/1511313/fall-out-boy-nearly-done-writing-next-lp.jhtml|title= Fall Out Boy Nearly Done Writing 'Way Different' Next LP|last=Montgomery|first=James|date=October 11, 2005|accessdate=May 14, 2011|work=Vh1.com|publisher=[[Vh1]]}}</ref>  Vocalist [[Patrick Stump]] stated that he wished to begin working on the record earlier, but the group<U+2019>s management urged the members to take time off to recuperate from their constant touring schedule.<ref name="StumpIntAquarian"/>

The band's label, [[Island Records]], underwent changes while the group prepared to record, which postponed the studio schedule for three weeks.<ref name="Don<U+2019>tExpect">{{cite web|title=Pete Wentz Says: Don't Expect A Fall Out Boy Album This Year|url=http://www.vh1.com/news/articles/1536625/fall-out-boy-wont-release-album-this-year.jhtml|last=Montgomery|first=James|date=July 19, 2006|accessdate=May 15, 2011|work=MTV News|publisher=[[Viacom]]}}</ref> Bassist/lyricist [[Pete Wentz]] asserted that <U+201C>We<U+2019>re definitely writing all the time, so we're not going to try to squeeze every last drop out of the stone.

==Recording and production==
While writing the album, Fall Out Boy began searching for potential producers.  The band sought out [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] [[Babyface (musician)|Babyface]], as they admired his work on the [[Music from the Motion Picture Josie and the Pussycats|soundtrack to the 2001 film version]] of ''Josie and the Pussycats''.<ref name="Babyface">{{cite web|url=http://www.vh1.com/news/articles/1513675/fall-out-boy-want-babyface-next-album.jhtml|title=Fall Out Boy Want Babyface To Produce Their Next Album|last=Montgomery|first=James|work=Vh1.com|publisher=Vh1|date=November 14, 2006|accessdate=May 15, 2011}}</ref>  Babyface saw one of the interviews in which the band discussed its desire to work with him and contacted the group.  Babyface produced two of the songs, "[[I'm Like a Lawyer with the Way I'm Always Trying to Get You Off (Me & You)]]" and "[[Thnks fr th Mmrs]]".  Before recording, the band began with six weeks of pre-production, which was encouraged by producer [[Neal Avron]].  This period included both rehearsals and writing, and began in [[Chicago]] before the group relocated to the Swing House studios in [[Los Angeles]].<ref name="Soundonsound">{{cite web|url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/jan08/articles/itavron.htm|title=Secrets Of The Mix Engineers: Neal Avron|last=Tingen|first=Paul|work=Sound on Sound|publisher=SOS Publications Group|date=January 26, 2007|accessdate=August 25, 2011}}</ref>  Additionally, some rough recordings of songs were created to be used in the studio as a future reference.<ref name="Soundonsound"/>

Generally, Wentz would write his lyrics first and send them to Stump, who would create a melody by playing guitar along to the words to <U+201C>find a groove<U+201D>.<ref name="GibsonInterview">{{cite web|url=http://www.gibson.com/en-us/Lifestyle/Features/Fall%20Out%20Boy_s%20Patrick%20Stump_/|title=Fall Out Boy's Patrick Stump: The Gibson Interview|last=Bosso|first=Joe|date=September 12, 2007|accessdate=August 24, 2011|work=Gibson Lifestyle|publisher=[[Gibson Guitar Company]]}}</ref>  Stump<U+2019>s goal with his songs was to create his music while changing Wentz<U+2019>s original lyrics as little as possible.  After a melody was written, Stump would create a general rhythm for the song.  Although Fall Out Boy had no specific rhythm or lead guitar roles, Stump viewed himself as more of a rhythm guitarist on the album due to his experience as a drummer in previous bands.<ref name="GibsonInterview"/> Trohman would often write his guitar parts after hearing Stump<U+2019>s work, filling in the <U+201C>empty spaces<U+201D> in the songs with <U+201C>tons of guitars and [[Johnny Marr]]-type atmospheric parts<U+201D>.<ref name="GibsonInterview"/>  The group felt that this writing process helped create a more full sound.<ref name="GibsonInterview"/>

Upon listening to the finished tracks, the members selected guest appearances they felt would work with the songs.<ref name="GlobalWarming"/>  The group "aim[ed] for the stars" on its choices of collaborators, with Wentz stating, "I want to bring in people who no one would expect...This year it's like, we made some new friends, like [[Lil Wayne]].

During the recording of the album, the band members pursued various other activities. Stump was also producing fellow [[Fueled By Ramen]] act [[The Hush Sound]]'s album ''[[Like Vines]]'', while Wentz was working on the conception of a [[Social networking service|social networking website]] called FriendsOrEnemies.com as well as designing for his clothing line, [[Clandestine Industries (Fashion)|Clandestine Industries]].<ref name="Babyface"/><ref name="FashionWeek">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1540619/pete-wentz-debuts-clothing-line-at-fashion-weektesting-at-422.jhtml|title='Fall Out Boy Takes On Fashion Week': Pete Wentz Debuts Clothing Line|date=September 11, 2006|accessdate=May 23, 2011|last=Montgomery|first=James|work=MTV News|publisher=Viacom}}</ref>  Wentz was often interviewed about the album at Clandestine fashion shows.<ref name="FashionWeek"/>

The album marked a departure in the Fall Out Boy<U+2019>s sound in which the band implemented a diverse array of musical styles. ''Infinity on High'' has been compared to the work of [[pop punk]] bands such as [[Green Day]], with Ann Powers of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' commenting, "Whatever snot and feedback courses through these songs, sweetness always triumphs, carried forth by bubblegum bass lines, snappy drums and tunes as comforting as lullabies."<ref name="SwanSong">{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/feb/04/entertainment/ca-rock4|title=LPs?

Stump called "[[This Ain't a Scene, It's an Arms Race]]" the "[[Funk music|funkiest]] thing we<U+2019>ve ever done", and attributes the change in musical style to his love of [[soul music]], which he acquired by listening to oldies stations as a child.<ref name="StumpIntAquarian"/><ref name="ChicagoMag">{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagomag.com/Chicago-Magazine/March-2007/Friends-of-Fall-Out-Boy/|title=Friends of Fall Out Boy|work=[[Chicago Magazine]]|publisher=The Tribune Company|date=March 4, 2007|accessdate=May 14, 2011}}</ref>   Wentz describes the song "a bit of '70s funk mixed with [the band<U+2019>s 2003 album] ''[[Take This to Your Grave]]'' with tight verses and big, fat choruses".<ref name=

The band also used instruments that did not appear on previous albums, such as [[Horn (instrument)|horns]] and [[Violin|violins]].  The members became more open to experimentation, but attempted to not over-produce the album; Stump stated that he "had to resist the temptation to use a lot of strings."<ref name="SceneIsBelieving">{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/content_display/magazine/features/e3i29e9420ff0998b4fc0db14cc7ef47d6e|title=Scene Is Believing: Fall Out Boy|last=Martens|first=Todd|date=January 27, 2007|accessdate=May 16, 2011|work=Billboard|publisher=Prometheus Global Media}}</ref>  "Golden" consists exclusively of vocals and piano, and Stump dubbed the song "much softer than anything we<U+2019>ve ever done".<ref name="StumpIntAquarian"/>  The group utilizes a full horn section on "I've Got All This Ringing in My Ears and None on My Fingers", a track which has been likened to [[Queen (band)|Queen]].<ref name=IGNReview>{{cite web|url=http://music.ign.com/articles/762/762235p1.html|title=Fall Out Boy - Infinity On High Review|last=Grischow|first=Chad|date=February 7, 2007|accessdate=May 15, 2011|work=[[IGN]]|publisher=[[News Corporation]]}}</ref>  Violins are used on both "Thnks fr th Mmrs", in addition to an [[acoustic guitar]] strummed [[flamenco]]-style, and "The (After) Life of the Party", which also features [[Electronic music|electronic]]-influenced sounds.<ref name="Sputnik">{{cite web|url=http://www.sputnikmusic.com/review/10937/Fall-Out-Boy-Infinity-On-High/|title=Fall Out Boy - Infinity on High Review|last=de Sylvia|first=Dave|date=February 3, 2007|accessdate=May 16, 2011|work=[[Sputnikmusic]]}}</ref><ref name=IGNReview/>  Commenting on the instruments used on "Thnks fr th Mmrs", Stump stated "I never thought I'd get a [[euphonium]] onto a Fall Out Boy record".<U+009D><ref name="RSDeets"/>  "You're Crashing, But You're No Wave" features a [[Gospel music|gospel]] choir, while "Thriller" contains a spoken-word intro from Jay-Z.<ref name="Glossier">{{cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2007-02-11/news/0702100230_1_pop-album-chart-punk-stadium-rock|title=Fall Out Boy's latest is a glossier, gaudier effort|date=February 11, 2007|last=Kot|first=Greg|work=Los Angeles Times|publisher=Eddy Hartenstein|accessdate=August 22, 2011}}</ref> Barry Nicolson of [[NME]] referred to the song as a "towering, [[Foo Fighters]]-esque slice of thunderous rhythm and radio-friendly melody."<ref name="NMEReview">{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/reviews/fall-out-boy/8137|title=Fall Out Boy: Infinity On High|last=Nicolson|first=Barry|work=[[NME]]|date=February 2, 2007|accessdate=May 15, 2011}}</ref>

===Lyrics===
[[File:Pete Wentz 2009.jpg|thumb|200px|Bassist/lyricist [[Pete Wentz]] was lyrically inspired by rapper [[Lil Wayne]] on the album.]]
While writing the album, Wentz drew lyrical inspiration from rapper [[Lil Wayne]], who he called "the best lyricist of [2006]."<ref name="Don<U+2019>tExpect"/>  Speaking of ''Infinity'''s lyrical themes, Wentz stated, "On the last record, the lyrics were about 'This is where we're going to be a year from now, and this is what you're going to be saying about us.' But this time, we realized that a lot of bands should spend less time running their mouths and more time writing their songs."<ref name="WayDifferent"/>  Much of the lyrics address the band's rise to fame and the pressure of maintaining a loyal fanbase. Sasha Frere-Jones of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' commented that "The only top-ten acts that talk about fame as much as Fall Out Boy does are rappers, although their take on selling records is less conflicted."<ref name="Frere-Jones">{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/musical/2007/03/12/070312crmu_music_frerejones|title=Fear Factor|last=Frere-Jones|first=Sasha|date=March 12, 2007|accessdate=June 12, 2011|work=[[The New Yorker]]|publisher=[[Cond<U+00E9> Nast]]}}</ref>  Cory Apar of Allmusic opined that "Wentz' lyrics are oftentimes resentful, full of fame-induced angst, and really emphasize his need to drive home his position that stardom has not changed the band."<ref name="AllmusicReview"/>

"Thriller" serves as an autobiographical recap of the two years following ''From Under the Cork Tree'''s release, referencing the band's mediocre CD reviews and breakout success, as well as thanking their "diehard" fans.<ref name="Slant">{{cite web|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/music/review/fall-out-boy-infinity-on-high/1044|title=Fall Out Boy: Infinity on High - Music Review|last=Shetler|first=Scott|date=February 16, 2007|accessdate=May 16, 2011|work=[[Slant Magazine]]}}</ref>  The song discusses the band's [[Grammy Award for Best New Artist|Best New Artist]] Grammy loss, and Wentz calls it the "most narcissistic song on the album".<ref name="RSDeets"/>  The line "Fix me in forty-five" is a reference to the length of a therapy session.<ref name="RSDeets"/>  On "This Ain't a Scene, It's an Arms Race", Wentz uses wartime-inspired metaphors to discuss their newfound popularity; he called the song "kind of a tongue-in-cheek look at the way we are so addicted and obsessed with new arts, cultures and loves <U+2014> to the point where it just becomes oversaturated."<ref name="LPDetails"/><ref name="Slant"/>  "I'm Like A Lawyer..." has been described as "about as close to a love song as you'll get from this band, a rare moment of tenderness among songs about blog entries, guest lists, and therapy sessions."<ref name="Slant"/>  In a tribute to the politicized [[Chicago]] [[Hardcore punk|hardcore]] scene, Wentz describes the story of a rigged court case of [[African-American]] civil rights activist [[Fred Hampton, Jr.]] in "You're Crashing, But You're No Wave".<ref name="RSDeets"/>  The song has been described as a "very well-written track, a welcome respite from the one-liners which permeate the majority of the record."<ref name="Sputnik"/>

==Packaging and title==
The title is taken from a letter written by [[Vincent van Gogh]] to his brother [[Theo van Gogh (art dealer)|Theo]] in 1888, in which he describes his renewed health and the positive effect it has had on his painting. Van Gogh's phrasing has been translated as "Be clearly aware of the stars and infinity on high. Then life seems almost enchanted after all".<ref name="LPDetails"/> Speaking of the title shortly after its announcement, Wentz stated "As for what that means in relation to the record, we'll just let it unfold when people hear it."<ref name="LPDetails"/> [[MTV]] reporter James Montgomery opined that "It's not difficult to see it as a statement about the band rising above detractors and finding strength within themselves."<ref name="LPDetails"/>

The photography for the album was done by Pamela Littky, and the sets on the album artwork were designed by Todd Fjelsted. The artwork for the album was designed by Chuck Anderson of NoPattern.

''Infinity on High'' received generally positive reviews from music critics, with many praising Stump's vocals and the album's new musical direction. At [[Metacritic]], which assigns a [[Standard score|normalized]] rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an [[weighted mean|average]] score of 75, based on 23 reviews, which indicates "generally favorable reviews".<ref name="Metacritic">{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/music/infinity-on-high|title=Infinity on High Reviews, Ratings, Credits, and More at Metacritic|work=Metacritic|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|accessdate=May 28, 2011}}</ref> Jody Rosen of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave the album an A-, commending the band's "new sense of swing" on its R&B-influenced songs and noting that Stump "has evolved into a superb frontman."<ref name="EWeeklyReview">{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20010462,00.html|title=Infinity on High Review|last=Rosen|first=Jody|date=February 2, 2007|accessdate=May 17, 2011|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Time Warner]]}}</ref>  Dave de Silva of [[Sputnikmusic]] agreed about Stump's new vocal style, saying that "his tone is smoother and more well-rounded, he<U+2019>s cut out the borderline screechy high-end which made parts of the previous album unlistenable and, though occasionally still nasally, his tones are far more varied and adaptable to different styles" as well as calling Wentz' lyrics "as sharp as ever".<ref name="Sputnik"/>  Andrew Blackie of [[PopMatters]] called the album "wildly exciting and experimental" and felt it greatly improved upon ''From Under the Cork Tree''.<ref name="PopMatters">{{cite web|url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/review/fall-out-boy-infinity-on-high/|title=Fall Out Boy: Infinity on High Review|last=Blackie|first=Andrew|date=February 5, 2007|accessdate=June 14, 2011|work=PopMatters}}</ref>  Aaron Burgess of ''[[The Onion A.V Club]]'' enjoyed the disc's new pop direction and felt that the songs that were more typical of Fall Out Boy's original sound, such as "The Carpal Tunnel of Love" undermined the album's potential.<ref name="ONIONAV">{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/fall-out-boy-infinity-on-high,7978/|title=Fall Out Boy: Infinity on High - Music Review|last=Burgess|first=Aaron|date=February 6, 2007|accessdate=May 16, 2011|work=[[The Onion A.V.

However, some critics felt that the album was overly ambitious and that the band's musical departure may alienate listeners. Chad Grischow of [[IGN]] felt that the album's dramatic hooks seem "bloated" at times: "The band does a great of focusing on what they do best, but the album does drown itself a bit with all the overwhelming enormity of it all."<ref name=IGNReview/>  Scott Shetler of ''[[Slant Magazine|Slant]]'' disliked the "melodramatic" undertones of "I've Got All This Ringing In My Ears And None On My Fingers" and "Golden", writing "they don't handle that style quite as well as [[Panic! At The Disco]]".<ref name="Slant"/>  Cory Apar of [[Allmusic]] opined that the album's pop direction contradicts the band's lyrical claims of wishing to stick to their roots.  He called the album's various styles "hit and miss", yet commented that "Once ''Infinity on High'' sinks in, it's indeed a fun record. But for a band that was once so self-assured and able to utilize its talents so compellingly, the album is regrettably haphazard."<ref name="AllmusicReview"/>  Caroline Sullivan of ''[[The Guardian]]'' believed that the album was overly sullen, but noted that "They may not be happy, but they haven't forgotten to be catchy."<ref name="TheGuardian">{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2007/feb/09/shopping.falloutboy|title=Fall Out Boy - Infinity on High Review|date=February 9, 2007|accessdate=May 28, 2011|work=The Guardian|work=Guardian Media Group}}</ref>  Barry Nicholson of [[NME]] found the amount of guest producers to be unnecessary and disliked some of the songs, but admired the album's "infectious" nature.<ref name="NMEReview"/>
