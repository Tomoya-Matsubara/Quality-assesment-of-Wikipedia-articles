{{otherships|HMS Leander}}

'''HMS ''Leander''''' was a second class cruiser, name ship of the [[Royal Navy]]'s first [[Leander class cruiser (1882)|''Leander''-class]] [[cruiser]]s.  During a revolution in Panama in 1900, the ''Leander'' helped protect the lives and property of foreign residents.

==Design and construction==

The ''Leander'' was built by Napier in Glasgow, being laid down in 1880, launched in 1882 and completed in 1885.  The ''Leander'' class were originally designated as steel dispatch vessels,<ref name=britainsnavy>[http://www.britainsnavy.co.uk/Ships/HMS%20Leander/HMS%20Leander%20(1882)%20CC%204.htm www.britainsnavy.co.uk HMS ''Leander'']</ref> but were reclassified as second class cruisers before they were completed.  The design was an improved version of the [[Iris class cruiser|''Iris'' class]], with a armoured deck and better armament.<ref name =worldnaval>[http://www.worldnavalships.com/leander_class1.htm www.worldnavalships.com ''Leander'' class]</ref>  The ''Leander'' had three masts and two funnels;<ref name =worldnaval/> she was square-rigged on the fore-mast and gaff-rigged on the two masts behind the funnels.<ref name=Ontario>[http://www.angloboerwarmuseum.com/Boer93i_ships.html Photos and a water colour of the ''Leander'' under sail in the Canadian Anglo-Boer War Museum]</ref>  She was armed with ten 6-inch BL guns, 16 machineguns and four above-water torpedo-tubes.<ref name =nzetc/><ref name =worldnaval/><ref name=Jane1900/>  Four of the machine guns were later replaced by four 3 pdr QFs.<ref name=Conways/><ref name=Jane1900/>

After her sister ship [[HMS Phaeton (1883)|''Phaeton'''s]] trials, the ''Leander'' had her funnels raised 6 ft to improve the draught to the boilers.  Once this was done, the ''Leander'' exceeded her designed speed.<ref name =worldnaval/>  She was the only one of her class to have forced draught.<ref name=Jane1900/> The ''Leander'' was a good steamer, but a poor sea-boat with a heavy roll in some sea conditions.<ref name=Conways/>

The December 1884 Navy List listed her as being at Chatham, with her commissioned and warrant officers "borne in ''Pembroke''" as follows:<ref name=NavyListDec84/>

==Seagoing career==
===1885-1889===

On 29 May 1885, Captain Martin J Dunlop arrived on board at Chatham and commissioned the ship.<ref name=NavyListDec85/><ref name=PRO1a>[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ The Catalogue of the UK National Archives] has logs for the ''Leander'' covering 29 May 1885 to 4 April 1889, catalogue references ADM 53/14282 to 14288</ref>  The first few days were spent first cleaning and then provisioning the ship.  On 3 June, they tested the flooding arrangements of the magazines and shell rooms and found they were correct.  On 5 June at 16:00, ''Leander'' was hauled out of the basin and proceeded under steam down the Medway in charge of the pilot and at 17:45 secured to the ''swinging buoy'' at Sheerness the engines using 5 tons 8 cwt of coal and the ship a further 3 cwt; no coal was used distilling.  One man fell overboard, and went on the sick list.  On 6 June they took on board powder, shot and shell, and 300 lbs of fresh beef and 200 lbs of vegetables.  On 8 June they swung the ship to adjust the compasses.  On 9 June, the ship went out for gunnery practice, burning 26 tons 5 cwt of coal for the engines and 6 cwt for the ship.  She fired 21 rounds from the 6-in BL; firing caused a number of breakages: 1 axial vent for a 6-in BL, the glass of two electric light projectors [searchlights], and the Pawl of Compressor of Admiralty Carriage.<ref name=Log1885>''Log of HMS Leander 29 May 1885 <U+2013> 22 May 1886'', UK National Archives file ADM 53/14282</ref>

Still secured to the buoy off Sheerness Dockyard, she received 90 lbs of fresh vegetables and 182 lbs fresh beef on 10 June.  On 11 June, she was inspected by the Commander-in-Chief.  Repairs in the engine room appeared to be complete by early afternoon, and fires were lighted in four boilers between 14:30 and 15:30; the ship prepared for sea, however soon after 18:00 a defect was found in the after centrifugal fan spindle in the engine room, so fires were banked.  Artificers worked all night to repair the defect.  Repairs in the engine room were completed by 17:00 on 12 June.  Fires were brought forward in the boilers, and at 19:00, the ship slipped and proceeded out under steam.  She proceeded to Portsmouth; travelling 154 nautical miles under steam burning 35 tons 18 cwt coal for the engines and 6 cwt for the ship.  At Portsmouth she saluted the saluted the admiral superintendent with 11 guns at 14:35.  On 15 June she stowed Whitehead torpedoes.  Some torpedoes were fired to test them.<ref name=Log1885/>

On 16 June she proceeded to Berehaven  arriving on the evening of 17 June finding there the [[Royal Navy  Evolutionary Squadron 1885|Evolutionary Squadron]] consisting of [[HMS Minotaur (1863)|''Minotaur'']], [[HMS Hercules (1868)|''Hercules'']], [[HMS Agincourt (1865)|''Agincourt'']], [[HMS Sultan (1870)|''Sultan'']], [[HMS Polyphemus (1881)|''Polyphemus'']], [[HMS Devastation (1871)|''Devastation'']], [[HMS Iron Duke (1870)|''Iron Duke'']], [[HMS Hotspur (1870)|''Hotspur'']], [[HMS Lord Warden (1865)|''Lord Warden'']], [[HMS Repulse (1868)|''Repulse'']], [[HMS Shannon (1875)|''Shannon'']], [[HMS Ajax (1880)|''Ajax'']], [[HMS Penelope (1867)|''Penelope'']], [[HMS Hecla (1878)|''Hecla'']], [[HMS Rupert (1872)|''Rupert'']], [[HMS Cormorant (1877)|''Cormorant'']], [[HMS Conquest (1878)|''Conquest'']], [[HMS Mercury (1878)|''Mercury'']], [[HMS Racer (1884)|''Racer'']], [[HMS Mariner (1884)|''Mariner'']], [[HMS Hawke ()|''Hawke'']].  At 1830 she saluted the flag of [[Geoffrey Hornby|Admiral Sir Geoffrey Phipps Hornby]] with 17 guns.<ref name=Log1885/>

Evolutionary Squadron was engaged in what became the first of the Victorian Royal Navy's annual manoeuvres. When the ''Leander'' joined on 17 June, she was attached to the ships blockading Berehaven.  On 18 June "the weather was so stormy that all exercises were suspended... After sunset, the ''Conquest'', ''Mercury'', ''Leander'', ''Racer'', ''Cormorant'' and ''Mariner'' with the torpedo boats attached to them got under way top take up their position of observation outside the haven.  The weather proved so boisterous that the blocading division returned before it had reached the open water outside.  In returning... the ''Leander'', while manoeuvring to keep clear of the ''Conquest'', struck on the Hornet rock, and was seriously injured.  As soon as the accident occurred the engines were stopped, the watertight doors closed, the pumps were set going, and collision mats and sails were passed under the ship's bottom.  After some time it was found that e pumps failed to gain on the leak.  On the following day the ship was moved nearer the shore, so as to be ready to beach in case of necessity.  Early, however on the 21st the divers succeeded in finding the leak and stopping it with the patent leak-stopper.  The ship's hold was thereupon cleared of water."<ref name=BNA1886p119>Lord Brassey, ''The Naval Annual 1886'', pages 118-199.</ref>  It was not until 24 June that ''Leander'' was ready to go to sea again.<ref name=Log1885/>  On 26 June, the ''Leander'', escorted by the ''Mercury'', arrived at Devonport, where she was placed in dock.<ref name=BNA1886p119/>  The damage to the ''Leader'' was described as follows: "The sea entered through numerous rivet holes where rivets had been sheared, but the compartment kept the ship afloat in a working condition."<ref name=BNA1886p199>"Lord Brassey, ''The Naval Annual, 1886'', page 199.</ref>  Amongst the stores destroyed by water were 168 lb of soft soap and 400 lb powder (propellant for the guns).<ref name=Log1885/>  The repairs to the ship cost <U+00A3>8,947.<ref>[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1887/jul/18/supply-navy-estimates#S3V0317P0_18870718_HOC_172 Hansard HC Deb 18 July 1887 vol 317 c1208 and 1287] House of Commons, 18 July 1887<br>'''[[Lord Randolph Churchill]]''' said: "The ''Leander'', built in 1885<U+2013>6, was completed for <U+00A3>191,000; but in the same year the Admiralty spent <U+00A3>8,947 on her."<br>[[Edward Field (MP)|'''Admiral Edward Field''']] replied: "the noble Lord spoke of the ''Leander'', of the great scandal of her costing within a short time of her construction over <U+00A3>8,000. Yes; but he did not tell the reason. Accidents will happen to ships as to other things; and an accident happened to that ship when she was with the Squadron on the Coast of Ireland. She ran upon a rock coming into Berehaven by the west entrance, and knocked a hole in her bottom. You do not suppose you could repair her for a mere nothing, and that sum represents the cost of the repairs of the ship after that accident."</ref>

After her brief service with the 1885 Evolutionary Squadron, the ''Leander'' served on the China Station.<ref name=NavyListDec85/>

===1895-1897===

The following account of the ''Leander's'' time in reserve and her refit was written at least 25 years after the event by a retired paymaster officer.  In some details this is at variance with the account in the ''Leander's'' logbook for 1897 (see next section). 
:"The ''Leander'' paid off at Chatham after many years in China [in November 1895<ref name=PRO1c/>].  Naturally she was in a bad state, and the Dockyard officers reported her as only fit for C Division of the Reserve; that is to say, she required an extensive refit, which meant landing all her stores and stripping her. This was reported to the Controller [[Jacky Fisher|[Rear Admiral J.A. Fisher]]], and he wired back that the ''Leander'' was to be paid off into the A Division, meaning that no repairs were to be taken in hand, and that her name would appear in the list of ships ready for sea at forty-eight hours notice. As this was contrary to Regulations, besides being false, a further report was made to the Admiralty.  Fisher replied: 'If the dockyard offers will not do as I tell them, I will replace them by others who will.' The ''Leander'' paid off all standing, and I was ordered to keep her defect lists and reports of the survey until the Admiralty should be pleased to order them to be taken in hand. After some months [actually 1897] Admiralty orders were received for the ''Leander'' to be commissioned by Captain Fegen for the Pacific.  We reported that she was unfit to go to sea until refitted.  The reply was that the Admiralty orders were to be obeyed.  The ''Leander'' did commission at Chatham.  She got as far as Portsmouth, where Sir Nowel Salmon was Commander-in-Chief, whom Fisher could not bully.  the result was that the ''Leander'' was detained at Portsmouth to have her necessary defects made good.  If anything had happened to her owing to her unseaworthy state, it would have been scandalous."<ref name=Paymaster/>

===1897-1901===

HMS Leander was commissioned by Captain FF Fegen at Chatham on Tuesday 8 June 1897.  On the morning on 11 June, she was moved to No 8 buoy Sheerness, where she was swung to measure the deviation of her magnetic compass.  On 16 June she was moved to No 4 Buoy in Little Nore, and the next day to the Downs off Deal.  At 2115 on 19 June she weighed anchor and proceeded to Spithead, where she arrived the next day.  She remained at Spithead until 2 July, and then went to Berehaven, arriving on 4th July.  She left Berehaven on 7 July, going to the rendezvous for manoeuvres.  She then stopped at Falmouth Harbour four hours on 11 July.  She had gunnery practice on 12th July, expending 25 6-in common shell, 5 6-in shrapnel, 10 6-in blanks, and 27 rounds of 3-pdr Hotchkiss.  She then returned to Sheerness arriving on 14 July.  On 20 July, dockyard hands started being employed on board each day, finishing on 9 August (including weekends).  Typically the number of dockyard hands was between 11 and 22.  On 12 August she was reswung at Sheerness, and then she put to sea arriving at Plymouth the next day.  She remained at Plymouth until she sailed for Vigo on 19 August, arriving on 22 August.  She was again reswung off Vigo on 24 August 1897.<ref>She was next reswung off the coast of Peru on 14 June 1898.</ref>  She arrived at Valparaiso (Chile) on 28 October.  She had gunnery practice again in November 1897, expending 35 cast steel 6-in filled common shell, 5 iron 6-in filled shrapnel shells, 20 3-pdr, 78 cartridges saluting, 2 green very lights, and 1,120 rounds .45<U+201D> machine gun ball cartridges.<ref>Ships Log HMS Leander, 8th June 1897 to 9th September 1898.

In 1902 it was decided that ''Leander'' was obsolete as a cruiser and should be fitted as a "dep<U+00F4>t ship for torpedo boat destroyers"<ref>[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1906/oct/24/obsolete-war-ships#S4V0163P0_19061024_HOC_20 Hansard, HC Deb 24 October 1906 vol 163 cc179-83 Obsolete War-Ships]</ref> in the Mediterranean.<ref>[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1902/feb/21/new-construction#S4V0103P0_19020221_HOC_147 Hansard HC Deb 21 February 1902 vol 103 c739.

O. Arnold-Forster|Mr Arnold-Forster]], was asked in the House of Commons about the choice of boilers.  The old boilers were cylindrical single-ended boilers fitted on in 1883.  The replacement boilers were of the same type, made by Messrs. J. Brown & Co. of Clydebank.<ref name=Hansard02May1902>[http://janus.lib.cam.ac.uk/db/node.xsp?search=hms Hansard: HC Deb 02 May 1902 vol 107 c558]<br>"[[William Allan (UK politician)|'''Mr. William Allan (Gateshead)''']]: I beg to ask the Secretary to the Admiralty if, seeing that H.M.S.

O. Arnold-Forster|'''Mr. Arnold-Forster''']]: The old boilers of the ''Leander'' are to be replaced by single-ended cylindrical boilers. The boilers now being inserted are made by Messrs. J. Brown & Co. of Clydebank. The boilers which are being removed are also cylindrical single-ended boilers. They were fitted on board in 1883.<br> '''Mr. William Allan''': May I ask the hon. Gentleman why water tube boilers were not fitted in this ship, seeing that they are so much approved of?<br> '''Mr. Arnold-Forster''': Because the ship was built for cylindrical boilers, and no special purpose would be served by the installation of water-tube boilers in her case."</ref> The ''Leander's'' refit was again controversial.
