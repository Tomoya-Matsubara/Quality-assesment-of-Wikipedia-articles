'''''Mister Ed''''' is an American television situation comedy produced by [[Filmways]]<ref>''The New York Times Encyclopedia of Television'' by Les Brown (Times Books, a division of Quadrangle/The New York Times Book Company, Inc., 1977), ISBN 0-8129-0721-3, p. 277</ref> that first aired in [[Broadcast syndication|syndication]] from January 5 to July 2, 1961, and then on [[CBS]] from October 1, 1961, to February 6, 1966.<ref name=brooks>{{cite book|last=Brooks|first=Tim |author2=Marsh, Earle F.|title=The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows, 1946-Present |publisher=Random House LLC|year=2009|edition=9|pages=905|isbn=0-307-48320-7}}</ref> The show's title character is a talking horse, originally appearing in short stories by [[Walter R. Brooks]].

''Mister Ed'' is one of the few series to debut in syndication and be picked up by a major network for prime time.<ref name=brooks/>

==Beginnings==
The ''Mister Ed'' show concept was derived from a series of short stories by children's author [[Walter R. Brooks]], which began with ''The Talking Horse'' in the September 18, 1937, issue of ''Liberty'' magazine.<ref>PARTNERS SLATE TV COMEDY SERIES: Lubin, Hamilton Pian 'Ed and Wilbur Pope' Films' --'Playhouse 90' Cast
By OSCAR GODBOUT Special to The New York Times.. New York Times (1923-Current file) [New York, N.Y] Oct 16, 1957: 70.</ref> Brooks is otherwise best known for the ''[[Freddy the Pig]]'' series of children's novels, which likewise featured talking animals that interact with humans. Sonia Chernus, secretary to director Arthur Lubin, introduced Lubin to the Brooks stories and is credited with developing the concept for television.

The show's concept resembles that of the ''[[Francis the Talking Mule]]'' movies in which an equine title character talks, but only to one person, thus causing a variety of opportunities and frustrations. The first six ''Francis'' films (1950-55) were also directed by Lubin.<ref name = "lubinlatimes"/>

==Synopsis==
The show in effect had two leads operating as a comedy team. The title role of Mister Ed, a talking [[palomino]], was played by [[gelding]] [[Bamboo Harvester]] and voiced by former Western film actor [[Allan Lane]]. The role of Ed's owner, a genial but somewhat [[Accident-proneness|klutzy]] architect named Wilbur Post, was played by [[Alan Young]]. Many of the program's gags follow from Mister Ed's tendency to talk only to Wilbur, his skills as a troublemaker, and his precociously human-like behaviour that far exceeds anything those around Wilbur expect of a horse. Another running gag centers on Wilbur being accident prone and inadvertently causing harm to himself and others. According to the show's producer, [[Arthur Lubin]], Young was chosen for the lead role because he "just seemed like the sort of guy a horse would talk to".<ref name = "lubinlatimes">{{Cite web| title = Mr. Ed and Arthur Lubin - Framework - Photos and Video - Visual Storytelling from the Los Angeles Times| accessdate = 2013-06-08| date = June 7, 2013| url = http://framework.latimes.com/2013/06/07/mr-ed-and-arthur-lubin/
}}</ref>

The other main character throughout the series is Wilbur's generally tolerant young wife, Carol ([[Connie Hines]]). The Posts also have two sets of neighbors, to whom Ed delights in making Wilbur appear as eccentric as possible.  They included the Addisons, Roger ([[Larry Keating]]) and his wife Kay ([[Edna Skinner]]), who both appeared from the pilot episode until Keating's death in 1963; thereafter, Skinner continued appearing as Kay alone, without mention of Roger's absence, until the neighbors were recast. During this period, Kay's brother Paul Fenton ([[Jack Albertson]]), who had made occasional appearances before, appears. Following the Addisons, the Posts' new neighbors were Col. Gordon Kirkwood, [[United States Air Force|USAF]] (Ret.), portrayed by [[Leon Ames (actor)|Leon Ames]], Wilbur's former commanding officer, and his wife Winnie (Florence MacMichael).  They appeared on the series from 1963 to 1965.<ref name=brooks/> In the final season, the Kirkwoods were phased out, while Carol's grumpy and uptight father, Mr. Higgins ([[Barry Kelley]]), who appeared occasionally throughout the entire series, apparently moved in with Wilbur and Carol during the final episodes.  Mr. Higgins loathes Wilbur since Wilbur's quirky eccentricity always clashes with his own emotionless and uptight personality. Carol's father never stops trying to persuade her to divorce Wilbur, whom he often refers to as a "kook" because of Wilbur's clumsiness. Alan Young performed double-duty during the final season of the series, also directing nearly all episodes.

Ed's ability to talk was never explained, or ever contemplated much on the show. In the first episode, when Wilbur expresses an inability to understand the situation, Ed offers the show's only remark on the subject: "Don't try. It's bigger than both of us!"

The Posts resided at 17230 Valley Spring in the San Fernando Valley.<ref>''Ed, the Jumper'' @ ~2:25 http://www.hulu.com/watch/197686</ref>

==Production notes==

The original, unaired [[television pilot|pilot]] for the series was entitled <U+201C>Wilbur Pope and Mister Ed<U+201D> and featured an unrelated instrumental big-band theme (with footage of [[Studebaker Lark]] automobiles being driven underneath the opening credits). In the pilot, which used a script that was nearly identical to that which would be used on the series premiere, used a totally different cast. Scott McKay played the title part of Wilbur Pope (surname later changed to <U+201C>Post<U+201D> prior to the series making it to air) and Sandra White played the role of Wilbur's wife.

The first horse that played Mister Ed for the first, unaired pilot episode was a [[chestnut (coat)|chestnut]] gelding.{{cn|date=June 2014}} The horse proved to be unruly and difficult to work with and was replaced with the horse named [[Bamboo Harvester]] (1949<U+2013>70), a [[crossbred]] gelding of [[American Saddlebred]], [[Arabian horse|Arabian]] and [[grade horse|grade]] ancestry.<ref>http://www.allbreedpedigree.com/bamboo+harvester</ref> A second pilot episode was filmed and Bamboo Harvester remained with the series until its cancellation.

===Making Ed "talk"===

''Mister Ed'''s producers left the talents that performed the title role uncredited. The show's credits listed Mister Ed as being played only by "Himself". 

The voice actor for Ed's spoken lines was [[Allan "Rocky" Lane]], a former [[B-movie]] cowboy star. [[Sheldon Allman]] provided Ed's singing voice in episodes; his solo line at the close of the show's theme song was provided by its composer, [[Jay Livingston]]. Allan Lane was alluded to by the producers only as "an actor who prefers to remain nameless." After the show became a hit, Lane campaigned the producers for credit but never received it. 

The horse [[Bamboo Harvester]] portrayed Ed throughout the run. Ed's stablemate, a quarterhorse named Pumpkin, also served as Bamboo Harvester's [[stunt double]] for the show. This horse later appeared again in the television series ''[[Green Acres]]''.

Bamboo Harvester's trainer was Les Hilton. To create the impression that Ed was having a conversation, Hilton initially used a thread technique he had employed for Lubin's earlier ''Mule'' films; in time, though, this became unnecessary. As actor Alan Young recounted: "It was initially done by putting a piece of nylon thread in his mouth. But Ed actually learned to move his lips on cue when the trainer touched his hoof. In fact, he soon learned to do it when I stopped talking during a scene! Ed was very smart."<ref>{{cite web|author=December 1, 2009 |url=http://www.mydailyfind.com/features/mister-eds-alan-young-talks-about-the-talking-horse-and-hollywood-lore.html |title=Alan Young talks about Mister Ed and Hollywood lore |publisher=My Daily Find |date=December 1, 2009 |accessdate=2013-06-08}}</ref>

Reports circulated during and after the show's run that the talking effect was achieved by crew members applying peanut butter to the horse's gums. Alan Young said in later interviews that he invented the story. "Al Simon and Arthur Lubin, the producers, suggested we keep the method [of making the horse appear to talk] a secret because they thought kids would be disappointed if they found out the technical details of how it was done, so I made up the peanut butter story, and everyone bought it.<ref>{{cite web|author=December 1, 2009 |url=http://www.mydailyfind.com/features/mister-eds-alan-young-talks-about-the-talking-horse-and-hollywood-lore.html |title=Alan Young talks about Mister Ed and Hollywood lore |publisher=My Daily Find |date=December 1, 2009 |accessdate=2013-06-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=John Clark |url=http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2004/01/04/PKG0D3QHMK1.DTL |title=Interview with Alan Young |publisher=Sfgate.com |date=January 4, 2004 |accessdate=2009-11-25}}</ref>

Young added that Bamboo Harvester saw trainer Les Hilton as the disciplinarian father figure. When scolded by Hilton for missing a cue, the horse would move to Young for comfort, treating the actor as a mother figure. Hilton told Young this was a positive development.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://video.google.com/videosearch?q=%22archive+of+american+television+interview+with+alan+young%22&num=10&so=2&start=0 |title=Archive of American Television Interview with Alan Young <U+2013> Google Videos |publisher=Video.google.com |accessdate=2009-11-25}}</ref>

===Theme song===
The theme song, titled "Mister Ed", was written by the songwriting team of [[Jay Livingston]] and [[Ray Evans]] and sung by Livingston himself. The melody is derived from that of a German Romantic-era song by [[Emile Waldteufel]]. The first seven episodes used only instrumental music to open the show; thereafter the version with lyrics was used. Livingston agreed to sing the song himself until a professional singer could be found; the producers liked the songwriter's vocals and kept them on the broadcast.

The theme song received renewed publicity twenty years after the show went off the air when Jim Brown, a preacher from [[South Point, Ohio]], claimed in May 1986 that it contained [[backmasking|"satanic messages"]] if heard in reverse. Brown and his colleague Greg Hudson claimed that the phrases "Someone sung this song for [[Satan]]" and "the source is Satan" would be audible. At their behest teenagers [[Book burning|burned]] over 300 records and cassettes of [[secular music]] with alleged satanic messages. The teens did not burn a copy of ''Television's Greatest Hits'' but Brown asserted that "Satan can be an influence whether they [the songwriters] know it or not. We don't think they did it on purpose and we're not getting down on ''Mister Ed''."<ref>{{cite web|last=Mitchell|first=Justin|title=Satan Taking Mr. Ed Along For The Ride?|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1986-05-08/features/8602020267_1_satan-backward-message|publisher=chicagotribune.com|date=May 8, 1986}}</ref>

===Sponsorship===
The series was sponsored from 1961-63 by [[Studebaker-Packard Corporation]] and [[Studebaker|Studebaker Corporation]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Foster|first=Patrick|title=Studebaker: The Complete History|year=2008|publisher=MotorBooks International|isbn=1-616-73018-8|page=158}}</ref>  [[Studebaker]]s were featured prominently in the show during this period. The Posts are shown owning a 1962 [[Studebaker Lark|Lark]] convertible, and the company used publicity shots featuring the Posts and Mister Ed with their product (various cast members also appeared in "integrated commercials" for [[Studebaker Lark|Lark]] at the end of the program).  When another Lark convertible served as the official pace car at the 1962 Indianapolis 500, Connie Hines attended the race as part of the promotion.

The Ford Motor Company provided the vehicles starting at the beginning of 1965.

==DVD releases==
[[MGM Home Entertainment]] released two ''Best-of'' collections of ''Mister Ed'' on DVD in [[Region 1]]. Volume 1 (released January 13, 2004) contains 21 episodes and Volume 2 (released March 8, 2005) contains 20 episodes. Due to poor sales, further volumes were not released.

MGM also released a single-disc release entitled ''Mister Ed's Barnyard Favorites'' on July 26, 2005 which contains the first eight episodes featured on Volume One.

[[Shout! Factory]] announced in June 2009 that they had acquired the rights to release ''Mister Ed'' on DVD, and subsequently released the first five seasons on DVD in Region 1 in the U.S. Notably, Seasons 4 and 5 are not available outside of the continental U.S.

Syndicated versions of eight episodes were utilized for Season One DVD release. All other DVD releases contain unedited, full-length versions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/39006/mister-ed-the-complete-first-season/ |title=Mister Ed: The Complete First Season: DVD Talk Review of the DVD Video |publisher=Dvdtalk.com |accessdate=2009-11-25}}</ref>

One episode (the second-season episode "Ed the Beneficiary") has lapsed into the public domain. Also in the public domain is a 19-minute production of the [[United States Department of the Treasury]], done in the style of a Mister Ed episode with the show's full cast (but without a [[laugh track]]), promoting [[U.S. savings bond|Savings Bonds]], and the original unaired pilot, which was published without a copyright notice.

On December 9, 2014, [[Shout! Factory]] will release ''Mister Ed- Complete Series'' on DVD in Region 1.<ref>[http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Mister-Ed-The-Complete-Series/20243 Shout!

In 2007, it was reported that a housing developer intended to create a community near [[Tahlequah, Oklahoma]] built around the supposed final resting place of Mister Ed (who died in 1970). It is intended to be themed to the style of the show and its period.<ref name="OnlyInOK">Gene Curtis, [http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/article.aspx?subjectid=260&articleid=071005_1_A4_Thefa71154&archive=yes "Only in Oklahoma: The famous Mister Ed still keeps 'em talking"], ''[[Tulsa World]]'', October 5, 2007.</ref>
