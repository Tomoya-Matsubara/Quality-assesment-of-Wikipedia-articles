[[Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics]] (PCBS).</ref> Located in a strategic position between [[Mount Ebal]] and [[Mount Gerizim]], it is the capital of the [[Nablus Governorate]] and a Palestinian commercial and cultural center.

Founded by the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] Emperor [[Vespasian]] in 72 CE as ''Flavia Neapolis'', Nablus has been ruled by many empires over the course of its almost 2,000-year-long history. In the 5th and 6th centuries, conflict between the city's [[Christianity|Christian]] and [[Samaritan]] inhabitants climaxed in a series of Samaritan revolts against [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] rule, before their violent quelling in 529 CE drastically dwindled that community's numbers in the city. In 636, ''Neapolis'', along with most of [[Palestine]], came under the rule of the [[Islam]]ic [[Rashidun|Arab Caliphate]] of [[Umar|Umar ibn al-Khattab]]; its name [[Arabic language|Arabicized]] to ''Nablus''. In 1099, the [[Crusade]]rs took control of the city for less than a century, leaving its mixed Muslim, Christian and Samaritan population relatively undisturbed. After [[Saladin]]'s [[Ayyubid]] forces took control of the interior of Palestine in 1187, Islamic rule was reestablished, and continued under the [[Mamluk]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] empires to follow.

Following its incorporation into the Ottoman empire in 1517, Nablus was designated capital of the ''Jabal Nablus'' ("Mount Nablus") district. In 1657, after a series of upheavals, a number of [[Arab]] clans from the northern and eastern [[Levant]] were dispatched to the city to reassert Ottoman authority, and loyalty from among these clans staved off challenges to the empire's authority by rival regional leaders, like [[Daher el-Omar]] in the 18th century, and [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali]]<U+2014>who briefly ruled Nablus<U+2014>in the 19th century. When Ottoman rule was firmly reestablished in 1841, Nablus prospered as a center of trade.

After the loss of the city to British forces during [[World War I]], Nablus was incorporated into the [[British Mandate of Palestine]] in 1922, and later designated to form part of the Arab state of Palestine under the 1947 [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine|UN partition plan]]. During the [[1948 Arab<U+2013>Israeli War|1948 Arab-Israeli War]], the city was captured and occupied by [[Jordan|Transjordan]], which subsequently unilaterally annexed it, until its [[Israeli-occupied territories|occupation]] by [[Israel]] during the 1967 [[Six-Day War]].

Today, the population is predominantly [[Muslim]], with small Christian and Samaritan minorities. Since 1995, the city has been governed by the [[Palestinian National Authority]]. In the Old City, there are a number of sites of archaeological significance, spanning the 1st to 15th centuries. The city is known for its ''[[kanafeh]]'', a popular sweet throughout the Middle East, and [[Nabulsi soap|soap]] industry.

==History==
===Classical antiquity===
{{further|Samaritan Revolts|Samaria}}
Flavia Neapolis ("new city of the emperor [[Flavius]]") was founded in 72 CE by the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] emperor [[Vespasian]] over an older [[Samaritan]] village, ''Mabartha'' ("the passage").<ref name=Negevp175>Negev and Gibson, 2005, p. 175.</ref> Located between [[Mount Ebal]] and [[Mount Gerizim]], the new city lay {{convert|2|km|mi|sp=us}} west of the [[Bible|Biblical]] city of [[Shechem]] which was destroyed by the Romans that same year during the [[First Jewish-Roman War]].<ref name="STF">{{cite web |url=http://www.christusrex.org/www1/ofm/mad/discussion/035discuss.html |title=Neapolis <U+2013> (Nablus) |accessdate=2008-04-19 |date=19 December 2000 |publisher=Studium Biblicum Franciscanum <U+2013> Jerusalem}}</ref><ref name="DNTA">{{cite web |url=http://www.dundee-nablus.org.uk/nablushistory.html |title=History of Nablus |accessdate=2008-04-24 |publisher=Dundee<U+2013>Nablus Twinning Association}}</ref> Holy places at the site of the city's founding include [[Joseph's Tomb]] and [[Jacob's Well]]. Due to the city's strategic geographic position and the abundance of water from nearby springs, Neapolis prospered, accumulating extensive territory, including the former [[Judea]]n [[toparchy]] of [[Aqraba|Acraba]].<ref name="STF"/>

Insofar as the hilly topography of the site would allow, the city was built on a Roman [[grid plan]] and settled with veterans who fought in the victorious legions and other foreign colonists.<ref name=Negevp175/> In the 2nd century CE, Emperor [[Hadrian]] built a grand theater in Neapolis that could seat up to 7,000 people.<ref name="Semplici"/> Coins found in Nablus dating to this period depict Roman military emblems and gods and goddesses of the Greek pantheon such as [[Zeus]], [[Artemis]], [[Serapis]], and [[Asklepios]].<ref name=Negevp175/> Neapolis was entirely [[Paganism|pagan]] at this time.<ref name=Negevp175/> [[Justin Martyr]] who was born in the city c. 100 CE, came into contact with [[Platonism]], but not with Christians there.<ref name=Negevp175/> The city flourished until the civil war between [[Septimius Severus]] and [[Pescennius Niger]] in 198<U+2013>9 CE. Having sided with Niger, who was defeated, the city was temporarily stripped of its legal privileges by Severus, who designated these to [[Sebastia, Nablus|Sebastia]] instead.<ref name=Negevp175/>

In 244 CE, [[Philip the Arab]] transformed Flavius Neapolis into a Roman colony named ''Julia Neapolis''. It retained this status until the rule of [[Trebonianus Gallus]] in 251 CE. The ''Encyclopaedia Judaica'' speculates that Christianity was dominant in the 2nd or 3rd century, with some sources positing a later date of 480 CE.<ref name="OCHA"/> It is known for certain that a bishop from Nablus participated in the [[First Council of Nicaea|Council of Nicaea]] in 325 CE.<ref name=Negevp176>Negev and Gibson, 2005, p. 176.</ref> The presence of Samaritans in the city is attested to in literary and epigraphic evidence dating to the 4th century CE.<ref name=Negevp176/> As yet, there is no evidence attesting to a Jewish presence in ancient Neapolis.<ref name=Negevp176/>

[[File:Ancient ruins in a Nablus neighborhood.JPG|thumb|right|Ruins from antiquity in a residential area in Nablus, 2008]]

Conflict among the Christian population of Neapolis emerged in 451. By this time, Neapolis was within the [[Palaestina Prima]] province under the rule of the [[Byzantine Empire]]. The tension was a result of [[Monophysitism|Monophysite]] Christian attempts to prevent the return of the [[Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem|Patriarch of Jerusalem]], [[Juvenal of Jerusalem|Juvenal]], to his [[episcopal see]].<ref name="STF"/> However, the conflict did not grow into civil strife.

As tensions among the Christians of Neapolis decreased, tensions between the Christian community and the [[Samaritans]] grew dramatically. In 484, the city became the site of a deadly encounter between the two groups, provoked by rumors that the Christians intended to transfer the remains of [[Aaron]]'s sons and grandsons [[Eleazar]], [[Ithamar]] and [[Phinehas]]. Samaritans reacted by entering the cathedral of Neapolis, killing the Christians inside and severing the fingers of the bishop Terebinthus. Terebinthus then fled to [[Constantinople]], requesting an army garrison to prevent further attacks. As a result of the revolt, the Byzantine emperor [[Zeno (emperor)|Zeno]] erected a church dedicated to [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] on Mount Gerizim. He also forbade the Samaritans to travel to the mountain to celebrate their religious ceremonies, and confiscated their synagogue there. These actions by the emperor fueled Samaritan anger towards the Christians further.<ref name="STF"/>

Thus, the Samaritans rebelled again under the rule of emperor [[Anastasius I (emperor)|Anastasius I]], reoccupying Mount Gerizim, which was subsequently reconquered by the Byzantine governor of [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]], Procopius. A third Samartian revolt which took place under the leadership of [[Julianus ben Sabar]] in 529 was perhaps the most violent. Neapolis' bishop [[Ammonas]] was murdered and the city's priests were hacked into pieces and then burned together with the relics of [[saint]]s. The forces of Emperor [[Justinian I]] were sent in to quell the revolt, which ended with the slaughter of the majority of the Samaritan population in the city.<ref name="STF"/>

===Early Islamic era===
[[File:Nablus Great Mosque-cropped.JPG|thumb|right|Minaret and entrance of 10th century Great Mosque of Nablus, 1908]]
Neapolis, along with most of Palestine, was conquered by the [[Muslim]]s under [[Khalid ibn al-Walid]], a general of the [[Rashidun army]] of [[Umar|Umar ibn al-Khattab]], in 636 after the [[Battle of Yarmouk]].<ref name="STF"/><ref name="DNTA"/> The city's name was retained in its [[Arabic language|Arabicize]]d form, ''Nabulus''. The town prevailed as an important trade center during the centuries of [[Islam]]ic [[Arab]] rule under the [[Umayyad]], [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]] and [[Fatimid]] dynasties. Under Muslim rule, Nablus contained a diverse population of Arabs and [[Persian people|Persian]]s, Muslims, Samaritans, Christians and [[Jew]]s.<ref name="STF"/> In the 10th century, the Arab geographer [[al-Muqaddasi]], described it as abundant of olive trees, with a large marketplace, a finely paved [[Great Mosque of Nablus|Great Mosque]], houses built of stone, a stream running through the center of the city, and notable mills.<ref name=Muqaddasip55>Muqaddasi, [http://www.archive.org/stream/cu31924028534265#page/n83/mode/2up/search/neapolis p. 55].</ref> He also noted that it was nicknamed "Little [[Damascus]]."<ref name="Semplici">Semplici, Andrea and Boccia, Mario.

===Crusader period===
The city was captured by [[Crusades|Crusaders]] in 1099, under the command of [[Tancred, Prince of Galilee|Prince Tancred]], and renamed ''Naples''.<ref name="STF"/> Though the Crusaders extorted many supplies from the population for their troops who were en route to Jerusalem, they did not sack the city, presumably because of the large Christian population there.<ref name="Andersonp72"/> Nablus became part of the [[royal domain]] of the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]]. The Muslim, Eastern Orthodox Christian, and Samaritan populations remained in the city, and were joined by some Crusaders who settled therein to take advantage of the city's abundant resources. In 1120, the Crusaders convened the [[Council of Nablus]] out of which was issued the first written laws for the kingdom.<ref name="STF"/> They converted the Samaritan synagogue in Nablus into a church.<ref name="Andersonp72">{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=TIcWAoiRhgAC|page=[http://books.google.ca/books?id=TIcWAoiRhgAC&pg=PA72 72]|title=The Keepers: an introduction to the history and culture of the Samaritans|first1=Robert T.|last1=Anderson|first2=Terry|last2=Giles|edition=Illustrated|publisher=Hendrickson Publishers|year=2002|ISBN=1565635191}}</ref> The Samaritan community built a new synagogue in the 1130s.<ref name=Smithp70>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=Y-noOrtrox4C|title=The crusades: a history|first1=Jonathan|last1=Riley-Smith|edition=2nd, illustrated|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|year=2005|ISBN=<!--0-8264-7270-2, -->9780826472700|page=[http://books.google.ca/books?id=Y-noOrtrox4C&pg=PA70 70]}}</ref>

During the second half of Crusader reign in Nablus, Muslim forces launched incursions to regain control of the city. In 1137, Arab and [[Turkish people|Turkish]] troops stationed in [[Damascus]] raided Nablus, killing many Christians and burning down the city's churches. However, they were unsuccessful in retaking the city.<ref name="STF"/> Queen [[Melisende of Jerusalem]] resided in Nablus from 1150 to 1161, after she was granted control over the city in order to resolve a dispute with her son [[Baldwin III of Jerusalem|Baldwin III]]. Crusaders began building Christian institutions in Nablus, including a church dedicated to the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]] and Resurrection of [[Jesus]], and in 1170 they erected a hospice for pilgrims.<ref name="STF"/>

===Ayyubid and Mamluk rule===
[[File:Interior view of Nasr Mosque.JPG|thumb|right|Interior view of the [[An-Nasr Mosque]], converted from a [[Crusades|Crusader]] church to a mosque in the 13th century]]
Crusader rule came to an end in 1187, when the [[Ayyubid]]s led by [[Saladin]] captured the city. According to a liturgical manuscript in [[Syriac]], [[Roman Catholic Church|Latin Christians]] fled Nablus, but the original [[Eastern Orthodox]] Christian inhabitants remained.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}} Syrian geographer [[Yaqut al-Hamawi]] (1179<U+2013>1229), wrote that Ayyubid Nablus was a "celebrated city in Filastin (Palestine)... having wide lands and a fine district." He also mentions the large Samaritan population in the city.<ref name="le Strange">Le Strange, 1890, pp.511<U+2013>515.</ref>

After its recapture by the Muslims, the [[Great Mosque of Nablus]], which had become a church under Crusader rule, was restored as a mosque by the Ayyubids, who also built a [[mausoleum]] in the old city.<ref name="OCHA"/> In 1242, the Great Mosque was burnt by the [[Templar Knights]] during a three-day raid in which they killed 1,000 people and took many women and children who were then sold in the slave markets of [[Acre, Israel|Acre]].<ref name=Pringlep98>{{Cite book|title=The Churches of the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem: A Corpus|url=http://books.google.com/?id=2Y0tA0xLzwEC&pg=RA1-PA3&lpg=RA1-PA3&dq=Lajjun+village |first1=Denys|last1=Pringle|year=1993|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-39037-0|page=98}}</ref><ref name=Humphreysp271>{{cite book|page=271|url=http://books.google.com/?id=JfXl5kvabhoC&pg=PA271&dq=nablus+templar+raid+1,000&cd=2#v=onepage&q=nablus%20templar%20raid%201%2C000|title=From Saladin to the Mongols: the Ayyubids of Damascus, 1193<U+2013>1260|first1=R.

The [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk dynasty]] gained control of Nablus in 1260 and during their reign, they built numerous mosques and schools.<ref name="DNTA"/> Under Mamluk rule, Nablus possessed running water, many [[Turkish bath]]es and exported olive oil and [[Nabulsi soap|soap]] to [[Egypt]], Syria, the [[Hejaz]], several [[Mediterranean]] islands, and the [[Arabian Desert]]. The city's olive oil was also used in the [[Umayyad Mosque]] in Damascus. [[Ibn Battuta]], the Arab explorer, visited Nablus in 1355, and described it as a city "full of trees and streams and full of olives." He noted that the city grew and exported [[carob]] jam to [[Cairo]] and Damascus.<ref name="le Strange"/>

===Ottoman era===
[[File:Nablus jacob well 1912.jpg|thumb|[[Jacob's Well]], 1912]]
Nablus came under the rule of the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1517, along with the whole of Palestine. The Ottomans divided Palestine into six ''[[sanjak|sanjaqs]]'' ("districts"): [[Safad]], [[Jenin]], [[Jerusalem]], [[Gaza City|Gaza]], [[Ajlun]] and [[District of Nablus|Nablus]], all of which were part of [[Ottoman Syria]]. These five ''sanjaqs'' were subdistricts of the [[Vilayet of Damascus]]. Sanjaq Nablus was further subdivided into five ''[[nahiya]]'' (subdistricts), in addition to the city itself. The Ottomans did not attempt to restructure the political configuration of the region on the local level such that the borders of the ''nahiya'' were drawn to coincide with the historic strongholds of certain families. Nablus was only one among a number of local centers of power within Jabal Nablus, and its relations with the surrounding villages, such as [[Beita, Nablus|Beita]] and [[Aqraba]], were partially mediated by the rural-based chiefs of the ''nahiya''.<ref name="Doumani3">Doumani, 1995, Chapter: The 1657 Campaign.</ref> During the 16th century, the population was predominantly Muslim, with Jewish, Samaritan and Christian minorities.<ref name="STF"/><ref>B. Lewis, Studies in the Ottoman Archives<U+2014>I, ''Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies'', University of London, Vol. 16, No. 3 (1954), 469<U+2013>501.</ref><ref name="Hutteroth"/>

After decades of upheavals and rebellions mounted by Arab tribes in the Middle East, the Ottomans attempted to reassert centralized control over the Arab ''vilayets''. In 1657, they sent an expeditionary force of local Ottoman-aligned Arab families based in various [[Syria]]n cities to pacify Nablus. In return for their services, the families were granted agricultural lands around the villages of Jabal Nablus. The Ottomans, fearing that the new Arab land holders would establish independent bases of power, dispersed the land plots to separate and distant locations within Jabal Nablus to avoid clusters of clans. The 1657 campaign succeeded and the Syrian Arab families began to have a foothold in Nablus' affairs. The largest family were the Nimrs, who originated from villages surrounding [[Hama]] and [[Homs]]. The other two prominent families were the Jarrars from [[Balqa Governorate|Balqa]] and the [[Touqan]]s from northern Syria. Eventually gaining the role of ''nahiya'' chiefs, they began intermarrying with local merchant and leading religious families. Thus, these new families were integrated into Nablus' population. Under an arrangement in 1723, the Touqans and the Nimrs shared and trade leadership of Nablus, and the Jarrars became the chiefs of the ''nahiya'' of Jabal Nablus.<ref name="Doumani3"/>

[[File:Tristram142a.jpg|thumb|right|Nablus, by [[Medlycott baronets|W. C. P. Medlycott]], in [[Henry Baker Tristram|H. B. Tristram]], 1865<ref>[[Henry Baker Tristram|H. B.

In the mid-18th century, [[Daher el-Omar]], a [[Bedouin]] ruler of the [[Galilee]] and Acre become a dominant figure in northern Palestine. In order to build up his army, he strove to gain a monopoly over the [[cotton]] and [[olive oil]] trade of the [[Levant]], which Jabal Nablus fueled. In 1771, during the [[Mamluk]] invasion of Syria, al-Omar aligned himself with the Mamluks and besieged Nablus, but did not succeed in taking the city. In 1773, he tried again without success. Nevertheless, from a political perspective, the sieges led to a decline in the importance of the city in favor of Acre. Al-Omar's successor, [[Jezzar Pasha]], maintained Acre's dominance over Nablus. After his reign ended in 1804, Nablus regained its autonomy, and the Touqans, who represented a principal opposing force, rose to power.<ref name="Doumani4"/>

===Egyptian rule and Ottoman revival===
[[File:Nablus 1898.jpg|thumb|right|Nablus in 1898]]
In 1831-32 [[Muhammad Ali Dynasty|Khedivate Egypt]], then led by [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali]], conquered Palestine from the Ottomans. A policy of [[conscription]] and new [[taxation]] was instituted which led to a [[Peasants' revolt of 1834 (Palestine)|revolt]] organized by the ''[[Palestinian nationalism#Notables|a'ayan]]'' (notables) of Nablus, [[Hebron]] and the Jerusalem-Jaffa area. On May 19, 1834, Qasim al-Ahmad<U+2014>the chief of the [[Jamma'in]] ''nahiya''<U+2014>rallied the ''[[fellahin]]'' (peasants) of Jabal Nablus and launched the revolt in protest at Egyptian conscription orders. The leaders of Nablus and its hinterland sent thousands of rebels to attack Jerusalem, the center of government authority in Palestine, aided by the [[Abu Ghosh]] clan, and they conquered the city on May 31. However, they were later defeated by Governor [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|Ibrahim Pasha]]'s forces the next month. Ibrahim then forced the heads of the Nablus clans to leave for nearby villages. By the end of August, the country-wide revolt had been suppressed and al-Ahmad was executed.<ref name="Doumani4">Doumani, 1995, Chapter: Egyptian rule, 1831<U+2013>1840.</ref>

The Egyptian occupation of Palestine resulted in the destruction of [[Acre, Israel|Acre]] and thus, the political importance of Nablus was further elevated. The Ottomans wrested back control of Palestine from the Khedivate in 1840<U+2013>41. As a result, the [[Arraba, Jenin|Arraba]]-based Abd al-Hadi clan rose to prominence. Loyal allies of Jezzar Pasha and the Touqans, they gained the governorship of Jabal Nablus and other ''sanjaks''.<ref name="Doumani4"/>

Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, Nablus was the principal trade and manufacturing center in Ottoman Syria. Its economic activity and regional leadership position surpassed that of [[Jerusalem]] and the coastal cities of [[Jaffa]] and Acre. [[Olive oil]] was the primary product of Nablus and fueled other related industries such as [[Nabulsi soap|soap-making]] and basket weaving.<ref name="Doumani"/> The city also was the top producer of cotton in the [[Levant]], topping the production from northern cities such as Damascus.<ref name="Doumani5"/> Jabal Nablus enjoyed a greater degree of [[autonomy]] than other ''sanjaqs'' under Ottoman control, probably because the city was the capital of a hilly region, in which there were no "foreigners" who held any military or bureaucratic posts. Thus, Nablus remained outside the direct "supervision" of the Ottoman government.<ref name="Doumani">Doumani, 1995, Chapter: Introduction.</ref>

===Twentieth century===
[[File:Nablus 1918.jpg|thumb|right|Nablus in 1918]]
The [[1927 Jericho earthquake]] destroyed many of the Nablus' historic buildings, including the An-Nasr Mosque.<ref>Damage Caused By Landslides During the Earthquakes of 1837 and 1927 in the Galilee Region, By D. Wachs and D. Levitte, MINISTRY OF ENERGY AND INFRASTRUCTURE, Report HYDRO/5/78 <U+2013> Jerusalem <U+2013> June 1978 [http://zadok.org/research/1927/landslides.html]</ref> Though they were subsequently rebuilt by [[Haj Amin al-Husayni]]'s [[Supreme Muslim Council]] in the mid-1930s, their previous "picturesque" character was lost. During British rule, Nablus emerged as a site of local resistance and the Old City quarter of Qaryun was demolished by the British during the [[1936<U+2013>1939 Arab revolt in Palestine]].<ref name=Doumani6>Doumani, 1995, Chapter: Family, Culture, and Trade.</ref>

[[Aliyah|Jewish immigration]] did not significantly impact the demographic composition of Nablus, and it was slated for inclusion in the Arab state envisioned by the [[United Nations General Assembly]]'s [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine|1947 partition plan for Palestine]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/un/res181.htm |title=United Nations General Assembly Resolution 181: The Arab State |publisher=The Avalon Project at Yale Law School |accessdate=2008-04-20}}</ref>

During the [[1948 Arab-Israeli War]], Nablus came under [[Jordan]]ian control. Thousands of Palestinian refugees fleeing from areas captured by [[Israel]] arrived in Nablus, settling in refugee camps in and around the city. Its population doubled and the influx of refugees put a heavy strain on the city's resources. Three such camps still located within the city limits today are [[Ein Beit al-Ma']], [[Balata]] and [[Askar (camp)|Askar]]. During the Jordanian period, the adjacent villages of [[Rafidia]], [[Balata al-Balad]], al-Juneid and Askar were annexed to the Nablus's municipality.<ref>Abujidi, 2014, p. 96.</ref> 

The 1967 [[Six-Day War]] ended in the Israeli capture of Nablus. Many [[Israeli settlement]]s were built around Nablus during the 1980s and early 1990s.

===Palestinian control===
[[File:Huwwara Checkpoint Palestine.jpg|thumb|right|View of [[Huwwara checkpoint]] with Palestinians waiting to travel south, 2006]]
Jurisdiction over the city was handed over to the Palestinian National Authority on December 12, 1995, as a result of the [[Oslo Accords]] [[Interim Agreement on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip|Interim Agreement on the West Bank]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.passia.org/palestine_facts/chronology/19941995.htm |title=Palestine Facts 1994<U+2013>1995 |accessdate=2008-04-24 |publisher=[[Palestinian Academic Society for the Study of International Affairs]] (PASSIA)}}</ref>

Nablus was a central flashpoint of violence between the [[Israel Defense Forces]] (IDF) and Palestinian militant groups. The level of violence dramatically increased from 2000 at the start of the [[Second Intifada]]. The city and the [[Palestinian refugee camps|refugee camps]] of [[Balata]] and [[Askar (camp)|Askar]] constituted the center of "knowhow" for the production and operation of the rockets in the West Bank.<ref name="intelligence">{{cite web |url=http://www.intelligence.org.il/eng/bu/Nablus/chapt.htm |title=The Terrorist Infrastructure in Nablus <U+2013> Results and Forecast |accessdate=2008-04-24 |work=Terrorisminfo.org}}</ref>

[[File:Old city of Nablus.JPG|thumb|left|Alley in the Old City leading to and from the [[souk]], 2008]]

In the center of Nablus lies the old city, composed of six major quarters: Yasmina, Gharb, Qaryun, Aqaba, Qaysariyya and Habala. Habala is the largest quarter and its population growth led to the development of two smaller neighborhoods: al-Arda and Tal al-Kreim. The old city is densely populated and prominent families include the Nimrs, Touqans, and Abd al-Hadis. The large fortress-like compound of the [[Abd al-Hadi Palace]] built in the 19th century is located in Qaryun. The Nimr Hall and the Touqan Palace are located in the center of the old city. There are several [[mosque]]s in the Old City: The [[Great Mosque of Nablus]], An-Nasr Mosque, al-Tina Mosque, [[al-Khadra Mosque]], [[Hanbali Mosque]], al-Anbia Mosque, Ajaj Mosque and others<ref name="Semplici">Semplici, Andrea and Boccia, Mario.

There are six ''[[hamaam]]s'' (Turkish baths) in the Old City, the most prominent of them being al-Shifa and al-Hana. Al-Shifa Hamaam was built by the Touqans in 1624.

===Religion===
In 891 AD, during the early centuries of [[Islam]]ic rule, Nablus had a religiously diverse population of Samaritans, local [[Muslim]]s and Christians. Arab geographer [[Shams al-Din al-Ansari al-Dimashqi|Al-Dimashqi]], recorded that under the rule of the Mamluk Dynasty (Muslim Dynsaty based in Egypt), local Muslims, Samaritans, Orthodox Christians, Catholics and Jews populated the city.<ref name="le Strange"/> At the 1931 census, the population was counted as 16,483 Muslims, 533 Christians, 6 Jews, 7 Druses and 160 Samaritans.<ref>E. Mills, Census of Palestine, 1931, Population of Villages, Towns and Administrative Areas, p63.</ref>

The majority of the inhabitants today are Muslim, but there are small [[Palestinian Christian|Christian]] and [[Samaritan]] communities as well. Much of the local [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] Muslim population of Nablus is believed to be descended from Samaritans who converted to Islam. Certain Nabulsi family names are associated with Samaritan ancestry <U+2013> Muslimani, Yaish, and Shakshir among others.<ref>[http://www.zajel.org/article_view.asp?newsID=4425&cat=18 The Political History of the Samaritans]</ref> According to the historian Fayyad Altif, large numbers of Samaritans converted due to persecution and because the monotheistic nature of Islam made it easy for them to accept it.<ref name=Ireton>{{cite web|title=The Samaritans <U+2013> A Jewish Sect in Israel: Strategies for Survival of an Ethno-religious Minority in the Twenty First Century|author=Sean Ireton|publisher=Anthrobase|year=2003|accessdate=2007-11-29|url=http://www.anthrobase.com/Txt/I/Ireton_S_01.htm}}</ref>

==Economy==

===Historic===
[[File:Manara clocktower.JPG|thumb|Manara clock tower in the Old City]]

Beginning in the early 16th century, trade networks connecting Nablus to [[Damascus]] and [[Cairo]] were supplemented by the establishment of trading posts in the [[Hejaz]] and [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf|Gulf]] regions to the south and east, as well as in the [[Anatolian Peninsula]] and the [[Mediterranean]] islands of [[Crete]] and [[Cyprus]]. Nablus also developed trade relations with [[Aleppo]], [[Mosul]], and [[Baghdad]].<ref name="Doumani2">Doumani, 1995, Chapter: The City of Nablus.</ref>

The Ottoman government ensured adequate safety and funding for the annual [[hajj|pilgrimage]] caravan (''qafilat al-hajj'') from Damascus to the Islamic holy cities of [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]]. This policy benefited Nablus economically. Pilgrimage caravans became the key factor in the fiscal and political relationship between Nablus and the central government. For a brief period in the early 17th century, the governor of Nablus, Farrukh Pasha Ibn Abdullah, was appointed leader of the pilgrimage caravan (''amir al-hajj''), and he constructued a large commercial compound in Nablus for that purpose.<ref name="Doumani2"/>

In 1882, there were 32 soap factories and 400 [[loom]]s exporting their products throughout the Middle East.<ref name="Semplici"/><ref name="IO">{{cite web |url=http://www.islamonline.net/english/In_Depth/PalestineInFocus/Thepeople/former/1967/WestBank/04.shtml |title="Little Damascus": Nablus City, West Bank |accessdate=2008-04-24 |publisher=Islam Online |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080413023559/http://www.islamonline.net/English/In_Depth/PalestineInFocus/Thepeople/former/1967/WestBank/04.shtml <!--Added by H3llBot--> |archivedate=2008-04-13}}</ref> Nablus exported three-fourths of its soap <U+2014> the city's most important commodity <U+2014> to Cairo by caravan through [[Gaza City|Gaza]] and the [[Sinai Peninsula]], and by sea through the ports of [[Jaffa]] and Gaza. From Egypt, and particularly from Cairo and [[Damietta]], Nablus merchants imported mainly rice, [[sugar]], and spices, as well as linen, cotton, and wool textiles. Cotton, soap, olive oil, and textiles were exported by Nablus merchants to Damascus, whence silks, high-quality textiles, copper, and a number luxury items, such as jewellery were imported.<ref name="Doumani2"/>

With regard to the local economy, agriculture was the major component. Outside of the city limits, there were extensive fields of [[olive]] groves, [[ficus|fig]] and [[pomegranate]] orchards and [[grape]] vineyards that covered the area's slopes. Crops, such as tomatoes, cucumbers, melons and ''[[mulukhiyya]]'' were grown in the fields, vegetable gardens, and grain mills scattered across central [[Samaria]].<ref name="Doumani2"/> Nablus was also the largest producer of [[cotton]] in the Levant, producing over {{convert|225000|kg|0|abbr=on}} of the product by 1837.<ref name="Doumani5">Doumani, 1995, Chapter: Cotton Production in Jabal Nablus.</ref>

Nablus is also home to [[an-Najah National University]], the largest [[List of Palestinian universities|Palestinian university]] in the West Bank. Founded in 1918 by the an-Najah Nabulsi School, it became a college in 1941 and a university in 1977. An-Najah was closed down by Israeli authorities during the [[First Intifada]], but reopened in 1991. Today, the university has three campuses in Nablus with over 16,500 students and 300 professors. The university's faculties include seven in the [[humanities]] and nine in the [[sciences]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www2.najah.edu/nnu_portal/index.php?page=56&lang=en |title=About An-Najah |accessdate=2008-04-24 |publisher=An-Najah National University Official Website |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080416155403/http://www2.najah.edu/nnu_portal/index.php?page=56&lang=en |archivedate = April 16, 2008}}</ref>

==Culture and arts==
[[File:Nablus1.jpg|right|thumb|Traditional Nablus dress featuring brightly colored coat draped over head and shoulders]]

Nablus and its culture enjoy a certain renown throughout the Palestinian Territories and the [[Arab world]] with significant and unique contributions to [[Palestinian culture]], [[Palestinian cuisine|cuisine]] and [[Palestinian costumes|costume]]. ''Nabulsi'', meaning "from Nablus", is used to describe items such as [[Palestinian handicrafts|handicrafts]] (e.g. [[Nabulsi soap]]) and food products (e.g. [[Nabulsi cheese]]) that are made in Nablus or in the traditional Nablus style.

===Traditional costume===
{{Main|Palestinian costumes}}
Nablus costume was of a distinctive style that employed colorful combinations of various fabrics. Due to its position as important trade center with a flourishing ''[[souk]]'' ("market"), in late 19th century, there was a large choice of fabrics available in the city, from [[Damascus]] and [[Aleppo]] [[silk]] to [[Manchester]] [[cotton]]s and [[Calico (fabric)|calico]]s. Similar in construction to the garments worn in the [[Galilee]], both long and short [[Turkish culture|Turkish style]] jackets were worn over the ''thob'' ("robe"). For daily wear, ''thobs'' were often made of white cotton or [[linen]], with a preference for winged sleeves. In the summer, costumes often incorporated interwoven striped bands of red, green and yellow on the front and back, with appliqu<U+00E9> and braidwork popularly decorating the ''qabbeh'' ("square chest piece").<ref name=PCA2>{{cite web |title=Palestine costume before 1948: by region |publisher=Palestine Costume Archive |accessdate=2008-08-01 |url=http://www.palestinecostumearchive.org/regional.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061024053919/http://www.palestinecostumearchive.org/regional.htm|archivedate=2006-10-24}}</ref>

===Cuisine===
[[File:Kinafa.jpg|right|thumb|A ''siniyyeh'' of [[Kanafeh]] ]]
Nablus is one of the Palestinian cities that sustained elite classes, fostering the development of a culture of "high cuisine", such as that of [[Damascus]] or [[Baghdad]]. The city is home to a number of food products well known throughout the Levant, the [[Arab world]] and the former [[provinces of the Ottoman Empire]].

''Kanafeh'' is the most famed ''Nabulsi'' sweet. Originating in Nablus during the 15th century, by 1575, its recipe was exported throughout the [[Ottoman Empire]] <U+2014> which controlled Palestine at the time. ''Kanafeh'' is made of several fine shreds of pastry noodles with honey-sweetened cheese in the center. The top layer of the pastry is usually dyed orange with food coloring and sprinkled with crushed pistachios. Though it is now made throughout the Middle East, to the present day, ''kanafeh Nabulsi'' enjoys continued fame, partly due to its use of a white-brine cheese called ''[[Nabulsi cheese|jibneh Nabulsi]]''. Boiled sugar is used as a syrup for ''kanafeh''.<ref name="IMEU2">{{cite web |url=http://imeu.net/news/article008132.shtml |title=Cuisine |accessdate=2008-04-24 |date=16 January 2006 |publisher=[[Institute for Middle East Understanding]]}}</ref>

Other sweets made in Nablus include ''[[baklawa]]'', "Tamriya", ''mabrumeh'' and ''ghuraybeh'',<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.atlastours.net/holyland/nablus.html |title=Nablus, Holy Land |accessdate=2008-04-24 |publisher=Atlas Travel and Tourist Agency}}</ref> a plain pastry made of butter, flour and sugar in an "S"-shape, or shaped as fingers or bracelets.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nablusculture.ps/nablus,sweets.htm |title=Nabulsi Sweets |accessdate=2008-04-24 |publisher=Nablus the Culture}}</ref>

===Cultural centers===
There are three cultural centers in Nablus. The Child Cultural Center (CCC), founded in 1998 and built in a renovated historic building, operates an art and drawing workshop, a stage for play performances, a music room, a children's library and a multimedia lab.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nablus.org/en/htm/cult_centers/child_cult_center.htm |title=Child Cultural Center |accessdate=2008-04-24 |publisher=Nablus Municipality}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> The Children Happiness Center (CHC) was also established in 1998. Its main activities include promoting Palestinian culture through social events, ''[[dabke]]'' classes and field trips. In addition to national culture, the CHC has a [[football (soccer)|football]] and [[chess]] team.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nablus.org/en/htm/cult_centers/child_happienies_center.htm |title=Children Happiness Center |accessdate=2008-04-24 |publisher=Nablus Municipality |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070328210701/http://www.nablus.org/en/htm/cult_centers/child_happienies_center.htm |archivedate = March 28, 2007}}</ref> The Nablus municipal government established its own cultural center in 2003, called the Nablus Municipality Cultural Center (NMCC) aimed at establishing and developing educational facilities.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nablus.org/en/htm/cult_centers/hamdy_manko.htm |title=Nablus Municipality Cultural Center "Future Kids" |accessdate=2008-04-24 |publisher=Nablus Municipality}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

Prior to the 1860s, in the summertime, the barilla would be placed in towering stacks, burned, and then the ashes and coals would be gathered into sacks, and transported to Nablus from the area of modern-day [[Jordan]] in large [[Camel train|caravans]]. In the city, the ashes and coals were pounded into a fine natural [[alkaline]] soda powder called ''qilw''.<ref name=SEMP/> Today, ''qilw'' is still used in combination with lime.

==Local government==
[[File:Clocktower downtown Nablus.JPG|thumb|right|New clock tower at Martyrs Square in downtown Nablus]]
The city of Nablus is the ''muhfaza'' (seat) of the [[Nablus Governorate]], and is governed by a municipal council made up of fifteen elected members, including the mayor.<ref name="NMMC">{{cite web |url=http://www.nablus.org/en/htm/aboutus/municipal_council.htm |title=Nablus Municipal Council |accessdate=2008-04-24 |publisher=Nablus Municipality}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

The two primary political parties in the municipal council are [[Hamas]] and [[Fatah]]. In the 2005 Palestinian municipal elections, the Reform and Change list representing the Hamas faction won 73.4% of the vote, gaining the majority of the municipal seats (13). Palestine Tomorrow, representing Fatah, gained the remaining two seats with 13.0% of the vote. Other political parties, such as the [[Palestinian People's Party]] and the [[Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine]] failed to gain any seats in the council, though they each received over 1,000 votes.<ref name="Results">{{cite web |url=http://www.elections.ps/admin/pdf/Municipal_Elections_Results_EN_(4).pdf |title=2005 Palestinian Local Elections, round 4 |accessdate=2010-08-21 |publisher=Higher Commission for Local Elections}}</ref>

Yaish's four-year term legally expired in December 2009. While elections in the West Bank were scheduled for 17 July 2010, they were canceled due to Fatah's lack of agreement on list of candidates. Nablus was one of the most important municipalities where Fatah failed to resolve internal conflicts that resulted in two competing Fatah lists: one headed by former mayor [[Ghassan Shakaa]] and one headed by Amin Makboul.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dailystar.com.lb/article.asp?edition_id=1&categ_id=5&article_id=117616#axzz0xEaOeWPj |title=A Palestinian election is aborted, again |publisher=Daily Star |accessdate=2010-08-21 }}</ref>

In the October 2012 municipal elections, Hamas boycotted the polls, protesting the holding of elections while reconciliation efforts with Fatah were at a standstill. Former mayor Ghassan Shakaa, a former local Fatah leader, won the vote as an independent against Fatah member Amin Makboul and another independent candidate.<ref>{{cite news |first=Ben |last=Lynfield |title=Hamas election boycott leaves West Bank Palestinians with only one choice |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2012/1006/Hamas-election-boycott-leaves-West-Bank-Palestinians-with-only-one-choice |work= |publisher=The Christian Science Monitor |date=2012-10-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Danny |last=Whatmough |url=http://nablus.dannywhatmough.com/2012/10/21/west-bank-elections-demonstrate-extent-of-political-divide/ |title=West Bank elections demonstrate extent of political divide |date=2012-10-21}}</ref>   

===Mayors===
{{Main|List of mayors of Nablus}}
Modern mayorship in Nablus began in 1869 with the appointment of Sheikh Mohammad Tuffaha by the Ottoman governor of Syria/Palestine. On July 2, 1980, [[Bassam Shakaa]], then mayor of Nablus, lost both of his legs as a result of a [[car bombing]] carried out by Israeli militants affiliated with the [[Gush Emunim Underground]] movement.<ref name="haaretz">{{cite web |url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=600596 |first=Danny |last=Rubenstein |authorlink=Danny Rubenstein |title=Fighting words/Far from the madding crowd |accessdate=2008-04-24 |publisher=Haaretz}}</ref>

In 1997, 99.7% of Nablus' 18,003 households were connected to electricity through a public network. Prior to its establishment in 1957, electricity came from private generators. Today, the majority of the inhabitants of 18 nearby towns, in addition to the city's inhabitants, are connected to the Nablus network.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nablus.org/en/content.php?id_itemcontent=245 |title=Electricity Department Statistics |accessdate=2008-04-24 |publisher=Nablus Municipality}}</ref>

===Fire department===
Nablus is one of the few cities in the West Bank to have a fire department, which was founded in 1958. At that time, the "fire brigade" (as it was called) was composed of five members and one extinguishing vehicle. In 2007, the department had seventy members and over twenty vehicles. Until 1986, it was responsible for all of the northern West Bank, but today it only covers the Nablus and [[Tubas Governorate]]s. From 1997 to 2006, Nablus' fire department extinguished 15,346 fires.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nablus.org/en/content.php?id_itemcontent=256&id_csub=279 |title=Fire Brigade |accessdate=2008-04-24 |publisher=Nablus Municipality}}</ref>

==Transportation==
[[File:Twilight in Nablus 154 - Aug 2011.jpg|thumb|right|Nablus, 2011]]
In the early 20th century, Nablus was the southernmost station of a spur from the [[Jezreel Valley railway]]'s [[Afula]] station, itself a spur from the [[Hejaz railway]]. The extension of the railway to Nablus was built in 1911<U+2013>12.<ref>[http://nabataea.net/hejazbk3.html The Hejaz Railroad] Nabataea.</ref> During the beginning of the British Mandate, one weekly train was operated from Haifa to Nablus via Afula and [[Jenin]]. The railway was destroyed during the [[1948 Arab<U+2013>Israeli War]], and the route of the line bisected by the [[Green Line (Israel)|Green Line]].

The main [[Highway 60 (Israel)|Beersheba<U+2013>Nazareth road]] running through the middle of the West Bank ends in Nablus, although thoroughfare of local Arabs is severely restricted. The city was connected to [[Tulkarm]], [[Qalqilya]] and [[Jenin]]by roads which are now blocked by the [[Israeli West Bank barrier]]. From 2000 until 2011, Israel maintained [[Israel Defense Forces checkpoint|checkpoint]]s such as [[Huwwara checkpoint]] which effectively cut off the city, severely curtailing social and economic travel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4027584,00.html |title=Palestinians: More barriers to be removed |publisher=Ynetnews.com |date=1995-06-20 |accessdate=2014-05-12}}</ref> From January 2002, buses, taxis, trucks and private citizens required a permit from the Israeli military authorities to leave and enter Nablus.<ref name="OCHA"/> Since 2011, there has been a relaxation of travel restrictions and the dismantlement of some checkpoints.<ref>[http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/idf-to-remove-major-west-bank-checkpoint-to-enable-palestinian-movement-1.342612 IDF to remove major West Bank checkpoint to enable Palestinian movement]. Haaretz. Feb.11, 2011</ref>

The nearest airport is the [[Ben Gurion International Airport]] in [[Lod]], [[Israel]], but because of restrictions governing the entry of Palestinians to Israel, and their lack of access to foreign Embassies to get travel visas, many residents must travel to [[Amman]], [[Jordan]] to use the [[Queen Alia International Airport]], which requires passage through a number of checkpoints and the Jordanian border. Taxis are the main form of public transportation within Nablus and the city contains 28 taxi offices and garages.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nablus.org/en/htm/guide/Taxi.htm |title=Taxi offices |accessdate=2008-04-24 |publisher=Nablus Municipality |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080217044118/http://www.nablus.org/en/htm/guide/Taxi.htm |archivedate = February 17, 2008}}</ref>
