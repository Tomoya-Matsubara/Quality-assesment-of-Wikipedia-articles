'''John Ronald Reuel Tolkien''' [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] ([[January 3]], [[1892]] <U+2013> [[September 2]], [[1973]]) is best known as the author of ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and its sequel ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. He was a professor of [[Old English language|Anglo-Saxon language]] at [[Oxford University|Oxford]] from 1925 to 1945, and of [[English studies|English language and literature]], also at Oxford, from 1945 to 1959. He was a strongly committed [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]]. Tolkien was a close friend of [[C. S. Lewis]], with whom he shared membership in the literary discussion group ''[[Inklings|the Inklings]]''.

In addition to ''The Hobbit'' and ''The Lord of the Rings'', Tolkien's published fiction includes ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' and other posthumously published books about what he called a ''[[legendarium]]'', a connected body of tales, fictional histories, invented languages, and other literary essays about an imagined world called [[Arda]], and [[Middle-earth]] (from ''[[Midgard|middangeard]]'', the lands inhabitable by [[Mannaz|Men]]) in particular, loosely identified as an 'alternative' remote past of our own world. Most of these works were compiled from Tolkien's notes by his son [[Christopher Tolkien]]. The enduring popularity and influence of Tolkien's works have established him as the "[[List of people known as father or mother of something#T|father]] of modern [[high fantasy|fantasy]] literature".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=8119893978710705002|title=J.

==Biography==
===The Tolkien family===
As far as is known, most of Tolkien's paternal ancestors were craftsmen. The Tolkien family had its roots in [[Saxony]] ([[Germany]]), but had been living in England since the 18th century, becoming "quickly and intensely English". <ref>(''Letters'' no. 165)</ref> The surname ''Tolkien'' is Anglicized from ''Tollkiehn'' (i.e. German ''tollk<U+00FC>hn'', "foolhardy", the etymological English translation would be ''dull-keen'', a literal translation of ''[[oxymoron]]''). The surname ''Rashbold'' of two characters in ''[[The Notion Club Papers]]'' is a [[pun]] on this.<ref>(undergraduate John Jethro Rashbold, and "old Professor Rashbold at Pembroke"; ''Sauron Defeated'', page 151, ''Letters'', 165)</ref>

===Childhood===
Tolkien was born on [[January 3]], [[1892]], in [[Bloemfontein]] in the [[Orange Free State]]
(now [[Free State Province|Free State]]), [[South Africa]], to [[Arthur Tolkien|Arthur Reuel Tolkien]] (1857&ndash;1896), an English bank manager, and his wife Mabel, ''n<U+00E9>e'' Suffield (1870&ndash;1904). Tolkien had one sibling, his younger brother, Hilary Arthur Reuel, who was born on [[February 17]], [[1894]].<ref>(''Biography'' 1977, pg 22)</ref>

While living in Africa he was bitten by a [[tarantula]] in the garden, an event which would have later parallels in his stories.<ref>(''Biography'' 1977, pg 21)</ref>  When he was three, Tolkien went to [[England]] with his mother and brother on what was intended to be a lengthy family visit. His father, however, died in South Africa of [[rheumatic fever]] before he could join them.<ref>(''Biography'' 1977, pg 24)</ref> This left the family without an income, so Tolkien's mother took him to live with her parents in [[Birmingham, England]]. Soon after in 1896, they moved to [[Sarehole]] (now in [[Hall Green]]), then a [[Worcestershire]] village, later annexed to Birmingham.<ref>(''Biography'' 1977, pg 27)</ref> He enjoyed exploring [[Sarehole Mill]] and [[Moseley Bog]] and the [[Clent Hills]] and [[Lickey Hills]], which would later inspire scenes in his books along with other Worcestershire towns and villages such as [[Bromsgrove]], [[Alcester]] and [[Alvechurch]] and places such as his aunt's farm of Bag End, the name of which would be used in his fiction.<ref>(''Biography'' 1977, pg 113)</ref>

[[Image:Jrrt 1905.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Ronald and Hilary Tolkien in 1905 (from Carpenter's ''Biography'')]]

Mabel tutored her two sons, and Ronald, as he was known in the family, was a keen pupil.<ref>(''Biography'' 1977, pg 29)</ref> She taught him a great deal of [[botany]], and she awakened in her son the enjoyment of the look and feel of plants. Young Tolkien liked to draw landscapes and trees. But his favourite lessons were those concerning languages, and his mother taught him the rudiments of [[Latin]] very early.<ref>{{cite web|last= Doughan |first=David|year=2002|url=http://www.tolkiensociety.org/tolkien/biography.html| title=JRR Tolkien Biography|work = Life of Tolkien|accessdate=2006-03-12}}</ref> He could read by the age of four, and could write fluently soon afterwards. He attended [[King Edward's School, Birmingham]] and, while a student there, helped "line the route" for the [[coronation]] parade of King [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]], being posted just outside the gates of [[Buckingham Palace]].<ref>(''Letters'', no. 306)</ref>  He later attended [[St. Philip's School]] and [[Exeter College, Oxford]].

His mother converted to [[Roman Catholicism]] in 1900 despite vehement protests by her [[Baptist]] family.<ref>(''Biography'' 1977, pg 31)</ref> She died of complications due to [[diabetes]] in 1904, when Tolkien was twelve, at Fern Cottage, [[Rednal]], which they were then renting. For the rest of his life, Tolkien felt that she had become a [[martyr]] for her faith; this had a profound effect on his own Catholic beliefs.<ref>(''Biography'' 1977, pg 39)</ref> Tolkien's devout faith was significant in the conversion of [[C. S. Lewis]] to [[Christianity]], though Tolkien was greatly disappointed that Lewis chose to follow [[Anglicanism]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Carpenter|first=Humphrey|year=1978|title=The Inklings|publisher=Allen & Unwin}}</ref>

During his subsequent orphanhood he was brought up by Father [[Francis Xavier Morgan]] of the [[Birmingham Oratory]] in the [[Edgbaston]] area of Birmingham. He lived there in the shadow of [[Perrott's Folly]] and the [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] tower of Edgbaston waterworks, which may have influenced the images of the dark towers within his works. Another strong influence was the [[Romanticism|romantic]] medievalist paintings of [[Edward Burne-Jones]] and the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]]; the [[Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery]] has a large and world-renowned collection of works and had put it on free public display from around 1908.

[[Image:jrrt 1911.jpg|left|thumb|150px|J. R. R. Tolkien in 1911 (from Carpenter's ''Biography'').]]

===Youth===
Tolkien met and fell in love with [[Edith Bratt|Edith Mary Bratt]], three years his senior, at the age of sixteen. Father Francis forbade him from meeting, talking, or even corresponding with her until he was twenty-one. He obeyed this prohibition to the letter.<ref>{{cite web|last=Doughan|first=David|year=2002|url=http://www.tolkiensociety.org/tolkien/biography.html#2| title=War, Lost Tales And Academia|work = J. R. R. Tolkien: A Biographical Sketch|accessdate=2006-03-12}}</ref>

In 1911, while they were at [[King Edward's School, Birmingham|King Edward's School]], [[Birmingham]], Tolkien and three friends, Rob Gilson, Geoffrey Smith and Christopher Wiseman, formed a semi-secret society which they called "the [[TCBS|T.C.B.S.]]", the initials standing for "Tea Club and Barrovian Society", alluding to their fondness of drinking [[tea]] in Barrow's Stores near the school and, illicitly, in the school library.<ref>(''Biography'' 1977, pg 53-54)</ref> After leaving school, the members stayed in touch, and in December 1914, they held a "Council" in London, at Wiseman's home. For Tolkien, the result of this meeting was a strong dedication to writing poetry.

In the summer of 1911, Tolkien went on holiday in [[Switzerland]], a trip that he recollects vividly in a 1968 letter,<ref>(''Letters'', no. 306)</ref> noting that [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]]'s journey across the [[Misty Mountains]] ("including the glissade down the slithering stones into the pine woods") is directly based on his adventures as their party of twelve hiked from [[Interlaken]] to [[Lauterbrunnen]], and on to camp in the moraines <!-- In Letters 306, Tolkien spells "morains", but this is not a direct quote. Oxford English Dictionary offers standardised spelling of "moraines." ---> beyond [[M<U+00FC>rren]]. Fifty-seven years later, Tolkien remembers his regret at leaving the view of the eternal snows of [[Jungfrau]] and [[Silberhorn]] ("the Silvertine ([[Celebdil]]) of my dreams"). They went across the [[Kleine Scheidegg]] on to [[Grindelwald]] and across the [[Grosse Scheidegg]] to [[Meiringen]]. They continued across the [[Grimsel Pass]] and through the upper [[Valais]] to [[Brig, Switzerland|Brig]], and on to the [[Aletsch glacier]] and [[Zermatt]].

[[Image:Tolkien 1916.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Tolkien in 1916, wearing his British Army uniform in a photograph from the middle years of [[World War I|WW1]] (from Carpenter's ''Biography'')]]

On the evening of his twenty-first birthday, Tolkien wrote to Edith a declaration of his love and asked her to marry him. She replied saying that she was already engaged but had done so because she had believed Tolkien had forgotten her. The two met up and beneath a railway viaduct renewed their love; Edith returned her ring and chose to marry Tolkien instead.<ref>(''Biography'' 1977, pg 67-69)</ref> Following their engagement Edith converted to Catholicism at Tolkien's insistence.<ref>(''Biography'' 1977, pg 73)</ref> They were engaged in Birmingham, in January 1913, and married in [[Warwick, England]], on [[March 22]], [[1916]].<ref>(''Biography'' 1977, pg 86)</ref>

With his childhood love of landscape, he visited [[Cornwall]] in 1914 and he was said to be deeply impressed by the singular Cornish coastline and sea.<ref>(''Biography'' 1977, pg 78)</ref> After graduating from the [[University of Oxford]] (where he was a member of [[Exeter College, Oxford|Exeter College]]) with a first-class degree in [[English studies|English]] language in 1915, Tolkien joined the [[British Army]] effort in [[World War I]] and served as a [[second lieutenant]] in the eleventh [[battalion]] of the [[Lancashire Fusiliers]].<ref>(''Biography'' 1977, pg 85)</ref> His battalion was moved to France in 1916, where Tolkien served as a communications officer during the [[Battle of the Somme (1916)|Battle of the Somme]] until he came down with [[trench fever]] on [[October 27]] and was moved back to England on [[November 8]].<ref>(''Biography'' 1977, pg 93)</ref> Many of his fellow servicemen, as well as many of his closest friends, were killed in the war. During his recovery in a cottage in [[Great Haywood]], [[Staffordshire, England]], he began to work on what he called ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]'', beginning with ''[[The Fall of Gondolin]]''. Throughout 1917 and 1918 his illness kept recurring, but he had recovered enough to do home service at various camps, and was promoted to lieutenant. When he was stationed at [[Kingston upon Hull]], one day he and Edith went walking in the woods at nearby [[Roos]], and Edith began to dance for him in a clearing among the flowering hemlock: "We walked in a wood where hemlock was growing, a sea of white flowers"<ref>Following rural English usage, Tolkien used the name 'hemlock' for various plants with white flowers in umbels, resembling the [[poison hemlock]]; the flowers among which Edith danced were more probably [[cow parsley]] (''Anthriscus sylvestris'') or [[wild carrot|Queen Anne's lace]] (''Daucus carota''). See John Garth ''Tolkien and the Great War'' (HarperCollins/Houghton Mifflin 2003) and Peter Gilliver, Jeremy Marshall, & Edmund Weiner ''The Ring of Words'' (OUP 2006).</ref>. This incident inspired the account of the meeting of [[Beren and L<U+00FA>thien]], and Tolkien often referred to Edith as his L<U+00FA>thien.<ref>{{cite web|last=Cater|first=Bill|year=[[April 12]], [[2001]]|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2001/12/04/batolk04.xml| title=We talked of love, death, and fairy tales|work =UK Telegraph|accessdate=2006-03-13}}</ref>

===Life and career===
Tolkien's first civilian job after World War I was at the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', where he worked mainly on the history and etymology of words of Germanic origin beginning with the letter ''W''.<ref>{{cite book|last= Gilliver|first=Peter|coauthors=Jeremy Marshall and Edmund Weiner|title=The Ring of Words: Tolkien and the OED|publisher=OUP|year=2006}}</ref> In 1920 he took up a post as [[Reader (academic rank)|Reader]] in English language at the [[University of Leeds]], and in 1924 was made a [[professor]] there, but in 1925 he returned to Oxford as a professor of [[Anglo-Saxon language|Anglo-Saxon]] at [[Pembroke College, Oxford|Pembroke College]].<ref>(''Biography'' 1977, pg 109, 114-115)</ref>

During his time at Pembroke, Tolkien wrote ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and the first two volumes of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. He also assisted Sir [[Mortimer Wheeler]] in the unearthing of a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[Asclepieion]] at [[Lydney Park]], [[Gloucestershire]], in 1928.<ref>See ''The Name Nodens'' (1932)</ref> Of Tolkien's academic publications, the 1936 lecture "[[Beowulf: the Monsters and the Critics]]" had a lasting influence on [[Beowulf]] research.<ref>(''Biography'' 1977, pg 143)</ref> Lewis E. Nicholson noted that the article Tolkien wrote about Beowulf is "widely recognized as a turning point in Beowulfian criticism", noting that Tolkien established the primacy of the poetic nature of the work as opposed to the purely linguistic elements. <ref>{{cite web|last= Ramey|first=Bill|year=[[March 30]] [[1998]]|url=http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/billramey/beowulf.htm| title=The Unity of Beowulf: Tolkien and the Critics|work = Wisdom's Children|accessdate=2006-03-13}}</ref> He also revealed in his famous article how highly he regarded Beowulf; "Beowulf is among my most valued sources ..." And indeed, there are many influences of Beowulf found in the ''Lord of the Rings''. <ref>{{cite web|last= Kennedy|first=Michael|year=2001|url=http://www.triode.net.au/~dragon/tilkal/issue1/beowulf.html| title=Tolkien and Beowulf- Warriors of Middle-earth|work = Amon Hen|accessdate=2006-05-18}}</ref> When Tolkien wrote, the consensus of scholarship deprecated ''Beowulf'' for dealing with childish battles with monsters rather than realistic tribal warfare; Tolkien argued that the author of ''[[Beowulf]]'' was addressing human destiny in general, not as limited by particular tribal politics, and therefore the monsters were essential to the poem. (Where ''Beowulf'' does deal with specific tribal struggles, as at Finnesburgh,  Tolkien argued firmly against reading in fantastic elements.)<ref>Tolkien: ''[[Finn and Hengest]]''. Chiefly, p.4 in the Introduction by [[Alan Bliss]]; for the parenthesis, the discussion of ''Eotena'', ''passim''.</ref>   

In 1945, he moved to [[Merton College, Oxford]], becoming the Merton Professor of English Language and Literature, in which post he remained until his retirement in 1959. Tolkien completed ''The Lord of the Rings'' in 1948, close to a decade after the first sketches. During the 1950s, Tolkien spent many of his long academic holidays at the home of his son John Francis in [[Stoke-on-Trent]]. Tolkien had an intense dislike for the side effects of [[industrialization]] which he considered a devouring of the English countryside. For most of his adult life he eschewed [[automobile]]s, preferring to ride a bicycle.<ref>(''Letters'' no. 64, 131, etc.)</ref> This attitude is perceptible from some parts of his work such as the forced industrialization of [[The Shire]] in ''The Lord of the Rings''.

[[Image:Jrrt 1972 tree.jpg|thumb|180px|The last known photograph of Tolkien, taken [[9 October]], [[1972]], next to one of his favourite trees (a ''[[Pinus nigra]]'') in the Botanic Garden, Oxford.]]

[[W.H. Auden]] was a frequent correspondent and long-time friend of Tolkien's, initiated by Auden's fascination with ''The Lord of the Rings'': Auden was among the most prominent early critics to praise the work. Tolkien wrote in a 1971 letter, "I am [...] very deeply in Auden's debt in recent years.  His support of me and interest in my work has been one of my chief encouragements.  He gave me very good reviews, notices and letters from the beginning when it was by no means a popular thing to do.  He was, in fact, sneered at for it." <ref>(''Letters'', no. 327)</ref>. 

Tolkien and Edith had four children: Rev. John Francis Reuel ([[November 17]] [[1917]]&ndash;[[January 22]] [[2003]]), Michael Hilary Reuel (October 1920&ndash;1984), [[Christopher Tolkien|Christopher John Reuel]] (1924) and Priscilla Anne Reuel (1929).

===Retirement and old age===
During his life in retirement, from 1959 up to his death in 1973, Tolkien increasingly turned into a figure of public attention and literary fame. The sale of his books was so profitable that he regretted he had not taken early retirement.<ref>{{cite web|last= Doughan |first=David|year=2002|url=http://www.tolkiensociety.org/tolkien/biography.html| title=JRR Tolkien Biography|work = Life of Tolkien|accessdate=2006-03-13}}</ref> While at first he wrote enthusiastic answers to reader inquiries, he became more and more suspicious of emerging [[Tolkien fandom]], especially among the [[hippy]] movement in the [[United States]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Meras|first=Phyllis|year=January 15, 1967|url=http://www.nytimes.com/books/01/02/11/specials/tolkien-gandalf.html| title="Go, Go, Gandalf"|work = New York Times|accessdate=2006-03-12}}</ref> In a 1972 letter he deplores having become a [[cult]]-figure, but admits that
:''even the nose of a very modest idol (younger than Chu-Bu and not much older than Sheemish) cannot remain entirely untickled by the sweet smell of incense!'' <ref>(''Letters'', no. 336; [[Chu-Bu and Sheemish]] are idols in a 1912 story by [[Edward Plunkett, 18th Baron Dunsany|Lord Dunsany]])</ref>.

Fan attention became so intense that Tolkien had to take his phone number out of the public directory<ref>(''Letters'', no. 332)</ref>, and eventually he and Edith moved to [[Bournemouth]] at the south coast. Tolkien was awarded the [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] by Queen [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth II]] at [[Buckingham Palace]] on [[March 28]], [[1972]]. His medal was stolen from his room later that night. The medal was returned much later{{citation needed}}, but the thief was never identified.

[[Image:Tolkiengrab.jpg|thumb|left|The grave of J. R. R. and Edith Tolkien, [[Wolvercote Cemetery]], [[Oxford]].]]
Edith Tolkien died on [[November 29]], [[1971]], at the age of eighty-two, and Tolkien had the name [[L<U+00FA>thien]] engraved on the stone at [[Wolvercote Cemetery]], [[Oxford]]. When Tolkien died twenty-one months later on [[September 2]], [[1973]], at the age of eighty-one, he was buried in the same grave, with [[Beren]] added to his name, so that the engravings now read:
:''Edith Mary Tolkien, L<U+00FA>thien, 1889&ndash;1971''
:''John Ronald Reuel Tolkien, Beren, 1892&ndash;1973''

Posthumously named after Tolkien are the Tolkien Road in [[Eastbourne]], [[East Sussex]], and the [[asteroid]] [[2675 Tolkien]]. Tolkien Way in [[Stoke-on-Trent]] is named after Tolkien's son, Fr. John Francis Tolkien, who was the priest in charge at the nearby Roman Catholic Church of Our Lady of the Angels and St. Peter in Chains.<ref>{{cite web|title=People of Stoke-on-Trent|url=http://www.thepotteries.org/people/tolkien_john.htm|accessdate=2005-03-13}}</ref>

==Writing==
[[Image:Jrrt lotr cover design.jpg|thumb|350px|Cover design for the three volumes of ''The Lord of the Rings'' by Tolkien]]

Beginning with ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]'', written while recuperating from illness during [[World War I]], Tolkien devised several themes that were reused in successive drafts of his ''[[legendarium]]''. The two most prominent stories, the tales of [[Beren and L<U+00FA>thien]] and that of [[T<U+00FA>rin]], were carried forward into long narrative poems (published in ''[[The Lays of Beleriand]]''). Tolkien wrote a brief summary of the legendarium these poems were intended to represent, and that summary eventually evolved into ''[[The Silmarillion]]'', an epic history that Tolkien started three times but never published. It was originally to be published along with the ''Lord of the Rings'', but printing costs were very high in the post-war years, later leading to the ''Lord of the Rings'' being published in three books.<ref>Hammond, Wayne G. ''J.R.R. Tolkien: A Descriptive Bibliography'', London: January 1993, Saint Pauls Biographies</ref>  The story of this continuous redrafting is told in the posthumous series ''[[The History of Middle-earth]]''. From around 1936, he began to extend this framework to include the tale of ''The Fall of [[N<U+00FA>menor]]'', which was inspired by the legend of [[Atlantis]].

Tolkien was strongly influenced by [[Anglo-Saxon literature]], [[Germanic mythology|Germanic]] and [[Norse mythology|Norse]] mythologies, [[Finnish mythology]], the [[Bible]], and [[Greek mythology]].<ref>{{cite book|first=David|last=Day|authorlink=David Day (Canadian)|year=[[February 1]], [[2002]]|title=[[Tolkien's Ring]]|location = New York|publisher=Barnes and Noble|id = ISBN 1-586-63527-1}}</ref>  The works most often cited as sources for Tolkien's stories include ''[[Beowulf]]'', the ''[[Kalevala]]'', the ''[[Poetic Edda]]'', the ''[[Volsunga saga]]'' and the ''[[Hervarar saga]]''.<ref>As described by Christopher Tolkien in ''Hervarar Saga ok Heidreks Konung'' (Oxford University, Trinity College). B. Litt. thesis. 1953/4. [Year uncertain], ''The Battle of the Goths and the Huns'', in: Saga-Book (University College, London, for the Viking Society for Northern Research) 14, part 3 (1955-6) [http://www.tolkiensociety.org/tolkien/bibl4.html]</ref>  Tolkien himself acknowledged [[Homer]], [[Sophocles]], and the ''Kalevala'' as influences or sources for some of his stories and ideas.<ref>{{cite web|last=Handwerk|first=Brian|year=[[March 1]], [[2004]]|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2001/12/1219_tolkienroots.html| title=Lord of the Rings Inspired by an Ancient Epic|work = National Geographic News|accessdate=2006-03-13}}</ref>  His borrowings also came from numerous Middle English works and poems.  A major philosophical influence on his writing is [[Alfred the Great|King Alfred]]'s Anglo-Saxon version of [[Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius|Boethius]]' ''[[Consolation of Philosophy]]'' known as the ''[[Lays of Boethius]]''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Gardner|first=John|year=[[October 23]] [[1977]]|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1977/10/23/books/tolkien-silmarillion.html| title=The World of Tolkien|work = New York Times|accessdate=2006-03-13}}</ref>  Characters in ''The Lord of the Rings'' such as [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]], [[Treebeard]], and [[Elrond]] make noticeably Boethian remarks.

In addition to his [[mythopoeia|mythopoetic compositions]], Tolkien enjoyed inventing fantasy stories to entertain his children.<ref>{{cite web|last=Phillip|first=Norman|year=2005|url=http://www.nytimes.com/books/01/02/11/specials/tolkien-mag67.html| title=The Prevalance of Hobbits|work = New York Times|accessdate=2006-03-12}}</ref> He wrote annual Christmas letters from [[Father Christmas]] for them, building up a series of short stories (later compiled and published as ''[[The Father Christmas Letters]]''). Other stories included ''[[Mr. Bliss]]'', ''[[Roverandom]]'', ''[[Smith of Wootton Major]]'', ''[[Farmer Giles of Ham]]'' and ''[[Leaf by Niggle]]''. ''Roverandom'' and ''Smith of Wootton Major'', like ''[[The Hobbit]]'', borrowed ideas from his ''legendarium''. ''Leaf by Niggle'' appears to be an autobiographical allegory, in which a "very small man", Niggle, works on a painting of a tree, but is so caught up with painstakingly painting individual leaves or elaborating the background, or so distracted by the demands of his neighbour, that he never manages to complete it.<ref>{{cite web|author =Site Editor|year=2005|url=http://www.tolkienlibrary.com/reviews/leafbyniggle.htm| title=Leaf by Niggle - a symbolic story about a small painter|work = Leaf by Niggle|accessdate=2006-03-12}}</ref>

Tolkien never expected his fictional stories to become popular, but he was persuaded by C.S. Lewis to publish a book he had written for his own children called ''[[The Hobbit]]'' in 1937.<ref>{{cite web|author =Times Editorial Staff|year=[[September 3]], [[1973]]|url=http://www.nytimes.com/books/01/02/11/specials/tolkien-obit.html| title=J.R.R. Tolkien Dead at 81: Wrote "The Lord of the Rings"|work = New York Times|accessdate=2006-03-12}}</ref> However, the book attracted adult readers as well, and it became popular enough for the publisher, [[George Allen & Unwin]], to ask Tolkien to work on a sequel.

Even though he felt uninspired on the topic, this request prompted Tolkien to begin what would become his most famous work: the epic three-volume novel ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' (published 1954&ndash;55). Tolkien spent more than ten years writing the primary narrative and appendices for ''The Lord of the Rings'', during which time he received the constant support of the [[Inklings]], in particular his closest friend Lewis, the author of ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia]]''. Both ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' are set against the background of ''[[The Silmarillion]]'', but in a time long after it.

Tolkien at first intended ''The Lord of the Rings'' as a children's tale like ''The Hobbit'', but it quickly grew darker and more serious in the writing.<ref>{{cite web|author =Times Editorial Staff|year=[[June 5]], [[1955]]|url=http://www.nytimes.com/books/01/02/11/specials/tolkien-oxford.html| title=Oxford Calling|work = New York Times|accessdate=2006-03-12}}</ref> Though a direct sequel to ''The Hobbit'', it addressed an older audience, drawing on the immense [[back story]] of [[Beleriand]] that Tolkien had constructed in previous years, and which eventually saw posthumous publication in ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' and other volumes. Tolkien's influence weighs heavily on the [[fantasy fiction|fantasy]] genre that grew up after the success of ''The Lord of the Rings''.

Tolkien continued to work on the history of Middle-earth until his death. His son [[Christopher Tolkien|Christopher]], with some assistance from fantasy writer [[Guy Gavriel Kay]], organized some of this material into one volume, published as ''The Silmarillion'' in 1977. In 1980 Christopher Tolkien followed this with a collection of more fragmentary material under the title ''[[Unfinished Tales]]'', and in subsequent years he published a massive amount of background material on the creation of Middle-earth in the twelve volumes of ''[[The History of Middle-earth]]''. All these posthumous works contain unfinished, abandoned, alternative and outright contradictory accounts, since they were always a work in progress, and Tolkien only rarely settled on a definitive version for any of the stories. There is not even complete consistency to be found between ''The Lord of the Rings'' and ''The Hobbit'', the two most closely related works, because Tolkien was never able to fully integrate all their traditions into each other. He commented in 1965, while editing ''The Hobbit'' for a third edition, that he would have preferred to completely rewrite the entire book.<ref>{{cite web|last= Martinez |first=Michael|year=December 7th, 2004|url=http://www.merp.com/essays/MichaelMartinez/michaelmartinezsuite101essay122| title=Middle-Earth Revised, Again|work = Merp.com|accessdate=2006-03-13}}</ref>

==Languages==
:''See also [[Languages of Middle-earth]]''

Both Tolkien's academic career and his literary production are inseparable from his love of [[language]] and [[philology]]. He specialized in [[Ancient Greek]] philology in college, and in 1915 graduated with [[Old Icelandic]] as special subject. He worked for the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] from 1918. In 1920, he went to [[Leeds]] as Reader in English Language, where he claimed credit for raising the number of students of [[linguistics]] from five to twenty. He gave courses in [[Old English]] [[heroic verse]], history of English, various Old English and [[Middle English]] texts, Old and Middle English philology, introductory [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] philology, [[Gothic language|Gothic]], Old Icelandic, and [[Middle Welsh language|Medieval Welsh]]. When in 1925, aged thirty-three, Tolkien applied for the Rawlinson and Bosworth Professorship of Anglo-Saxon, he boasted that his students of Germanic philology in Leeds had even formed a "[[Viking revival|Viking Club]]".<ref>(Letter dated 27 June 1925 to the Electors of the Rawlinson and Bosworth Professorship of Anglo-Saxon, University of Oxford, ''Letters'', no. 7)</ref>

Privately, Tolkien was attracted to "things of [[race|racial]] and linguistic significance", and he entertained notions of an inherited taste of language, which he termed the "native tongue" as opposed to "cradle tongue" in his 1955 lecture ''[[English and Welsh]]'', which is crucial to his understanding of race and language. He considered [[West Midlands (region)|west-midland]] Middle English his own "native tongue", and, as he wrote to [[W. H. Auden]] in 1955 <ref>(''Letters'', no. 163)</ref>, "I am a West-midlander by blood (and took to early west-midland Middle English as a known tongue as soon as I set eyes on it)"

Parallel to Tolkien's professional work as a philologist, and sometimes overshadowing this work, to the effect that his academic output remained rather thin, was his affection for the construction of [[artificial language]]s. The best developed of these are [[Quenya]] and [[Sindarin]], the etymological connection between which are at the core of much of Tolkien's ''legendarium''. Language and grammar for Tolkien was a matter of [[aesthetics]] and [[euphony]], and Quenya in particular was designed from "phonaesthetic" considerations; it was intended as an "Elvenlatin", and was phonologically based on Latin, with ingredients from [[Finnish language|Finnish]] and Greek <ref>(''Letters'', no. 144, 25 April 1954, to Naomi Mitchison)</ref>. A notable addition came in late 1945 with [[Ad<U+00FB>naic|N<U+00FA>men<U+00F3>rean]], a language of a "faintly [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] flavour", connected with Tolkien's [[Atlantis]] legend, which by ''[[The Notion Club Papers]]'' ties directly into his ideas about inheritability of language, and via the "[[Second Age]]" and the story of [[Earendil]] was grounded in the legendarium, thereby providing a link of Tolkien's twentieth-century "real primary world" with the legendary past of his Middle-earth.

Tolkien considered languages inseparable from the mythology associated with them, and he consequently took a dim view of [[auxiliary language]]s: In 1930 a congress of Esperantists were told as much by him, in his lecture ''[[A Secret Vice]]'', "Your language construction will breed a mythology", but by 1956 he concluded that "[[Volap<U+00FC>k]], [[Esperanto]], [[Ido]], [[Novial]], &c, &c, are dead, far deader than ancient unused languages, because their authors never invented any Esperanto legends" <ref>(''Letters'', no. 180)</ref>.

The popularity of Tolkien's books has had a small but lasting effect on the use of language in fantasy literature in particular, and even on mainstream dictionaries, which today commonly accept Tolkien's revival of the spellings ''dwarves'' and ''elvish'' (instead of ''dwarfs'' and ''elfish''), which had not been in use since the mid-1800s and earlier. Other terms he has coined such as ''[[eucatastrophe]]'' are mainly used in connection with Tolkien's work.

==Works inspired by Tolkien==
{{main|Works inspired by J. R. R. Tolkien}}

In a 1951 letter to [[Milton Waldman]], Tolkien writes about his intentions to create a ''"body of more or less connected legend"'', of which
:''The cycles should be linked to a majestic whole, and yet leave scope for other minds and hands, wielding paint and music and drama.'' <ref>(''Letters'', no. 131)</ref>

The hands and minds of many artists have indeed been inspired by Tolkien's legends. Personally known to him were [[Pauline Baynes]] (Tolkien's favourite illustrator of ''[[The Adventures of Tom Bombadil]]'' and ''[[Farmer Giles of Ham]]'') and [[Donald Swann]] (who set the music to ''[[The Road Goes Ever On]]''). Queen [[Margrethe II of Denmark]] created illustrations to ''The Lord of the Rings'' in the early 1970s. She sent them to Tolkien, who was struck by the similarity to the style of his own drawings.<ref>{{cite web|author= Thygesen, Peter |year= Autumn, 1999|url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3760/is_199910/ai_n8868143| title=Queen Margrethe II: Denmark's monarch for a modern age|work = Scandinavian Review|accessdate=2006-03-12}}</ref>

But Tolkien was not fond of all the artistic representation of his works that were produced in his lifetime, and was sometimes harshly disapproving.

In 1946, he rejects suggestions for illustrations by [[Horus Engels]] for the German edition of the ''Hobbit'' as ''"too [[The Walt Disney Company|Disnified]]"'',
:''Bilbo with a dribbling nose, and Gandalf as a figure of vulgar fun rather than the [[Odin]]ic wanderer that I think of.''<ref>(''Letters'', no. 107)</ref>

He was sceptical of the emerging [[Tolkien fandom|fandom]] in the [[United States]], and in 1954 he returned proposals for the dust jackets of the American edition of ''The Lord of the Rings'':
:''Thank you for sending me the projected 'blurbs', which I return. The Americans are not as a rule at all amenable to criticism or correction; but I think their effort is so poor that I feel constrained to make some effort to improve it.''<ref>(''Letters'', no. 144)</ref>

And in 1958, in an irritated reaction to a proposed movie adaptation of ''The Lord of the Rings'' by [[Morton Grady Zimmerman]] he writes,
:''I would ask them to make an effort of imagination sufficient to understand the irritation (and on occasion the resentment) of an author, who finds, increasingly as he proceeds, his work treated as it would seem carelessly in general, in places recklessly, and with no evident signs of any appreciation of what it is all about.''<ref>(''Letters'', no. 207)</ref>

He went on to criticize the script scene by scene (''"yet one more scene of screams and rather meaningless slashings"''). But Tolkien was in principle open to the idea of a movie adaptation. He sold the film, stage and merchandise rights of ''The Hobbit'' and ''The Lord of the Rings'' to [[United Artists]] in 1968, while, guided by scepticism towards future productions, he forbade that [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] should ever be involved:
:''It might be advisable [<U+2026>] to let the Americans do what seems good to them &ndash; as long as it was possible [<U+2026>] to veto anything from or influenced by the Disney studios (for all whose works I have a heartfelt loathing).''<ref>(''Letters'', no. 13)</ref>

United Artists never made a film, though at least [[John Boorman]] was planning a film in the early seventies. It would have been a live-action film which apparently would have been more to Tolkien's liking than an animated film. In 1976 the rights were sold to [[Tolkien Enterprises]], a division of the [[Saul Zaentz]] Company, and the [[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|first movie adaptation]] (an animated [[rotoscoping]] film) of ''The Lord of the Rings'' appeared only after Tolkien's death (in 1978, directed by [[Ralph Bakshi]]). The screenplay was written by the fantasy writer [[Peter S. Beagle]]. This first adaptation, however, only contained the first half of the story that is ''The Lord of the Rings''.<ref>{{cite web|author= Canby, Vincent |year= [[November 15]], [[1978]]|url=http://www.nytimes.com/books/01/02/11/specials/tolkien-lordfilm.html| title= Film: 'The Lord of the Rings' From Ralph Bakshi|work = New York Times|accessdate=2006-03-12}}</ref> In 1977 an animated TV production of ''The Hobbit'' was made by [[Rankin-Bass]], and in 1980 they produced an animated film titled ''The Return of the King'', which covered some of the portion of ''The Lord of the Rings'' that Bakshi was unable to complete. In 2001&ndash;3, [[New Line Cinema]] released ''The Lord of the Rings'' as a [[The Lord of the Rings film trilogy|trilogy of live-action films]], directed by [[Peter Jackson]].
