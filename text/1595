'''Hurricane Isabel''' was the costliest and deadliest [[Atlantic hurricane|hurricane]] in the [[2003 Atlantic hurricane season]]. The ninth named storm, fifth hurricane, and second major hurricane of the season, Isabel formed from a [[tropical wave]] on September 6 in the tropical [[Atlantic Ocean]]. It moved northwestward, and within an environment of light wind shear and warm waters it steadily strengthened to reach peak winds of 165&nbsp;mph (265&nbsp;km/h) on September 11. After fluctuating in intensity for four days, Isabel gradually weakened and made landfall on the [[Outer Banks]] of [[North Carolina]] with winds of 105&nbsp;mph (165&nbsp;km/h) on September 18. It quickly weakened over land and became [[extratropical cyclone|extratropical]] over western [[Pennsylvania]] the next day.

In North Carolina, the storm surge from Isabel washed out a portion of [[Hatteras Island]] to form what was unofficially known as [[Isabel Inlet]]. Damage was greatest along the Outer Banks, where thousands of homes were damaged or destroyed. The worst of the effects of Isabel occurred in [[Virginia]], especially in the [[Hampton Roads]] area and along the shores of rivers as far west and north as [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] and [[Washington, DC]]. Virginia reported the most deaths and damage from the hurricane. About 64% of the damage and 68% of the deaths occurred in North Carolina and Virginia.  Electric service was disrupted in areas of Virginia for several days, some more rural areas were without electricity for weeks, and local flooding caused thousands of dollars in damage.

Moderate to severe damage extended up the Atlantic coastline and as far inland as [[West Virginia]]. Roughly six million people were left without electric service in the eastern United States from the strong winds of Isabel. Rainfall from the storm extended from [[South Carolina]] to [[Maine]], and westward to [[Michigan]]. Throughout the path of Isabel, damage totaled about $3.6&nbsp;billion (2003&nbsp;USD, ${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|3600000000|2003}}}} {{#time:Y}}&nbsp;USD). 16&nbsp;deaths in seven states were directly related to the hurricane, with 35&nbsp;deaths in six states and one province indirectly related to the hurricane.

50&nbsp;hours prior to Isabel making landfall, the [[National Hurricane Center]] issued a [[tropical cyclone warnings and watches|hurricane watch]] from [[Little River, South Carolina]] to [[Chincoteague, Virginia]], including the [[Pamlico Sound|Pamlico]] and [[Albemarle Sound]]s and the lower [[Chesapeake Bay]]. The NHC also issued a tropical storm watch south of Little River, South Carolina to the mouth of the [[Santee River]], as well as from Chincoteague, Virginia northward to [[Little Egg Harbor|Little Egg Inlet]], [[New Jersey]]. Hurricane and tropical storm warnings were gradually issued for portions of the [[East Coast of the United States]]. By the time Isabel made landfall, a tropical storm warning existed from Chincoteague, Virginia to [[Fire Island, New York]] and from [[Cape Fear (headland)|Cape Fear]], [[North Carolina]] to the mouth of the Santee River in South Carolina, and a hurricane warning existed from Chincoteague, Virginia to Cape Fear. Landfall forecasts were very accurate; from three days prior, the average track forecast error for its landfall was only 36&nbsp;miles (58&nbsp;km), and for 48&nbsp;hours in advance the average track error was 18&nbsp;miles (29&nbsp;km).<ref name="tcr"/>

Officials declared mandatory evacuations for 24&nbsp;counties in [[North Carolina]], [[Virginia]], and [[Maryland]], though in general not many left. According to a survey conducted by the United States Department of Commerce, evacuation rates were estimated as follows; 45% in the [[Outer Banks]], 23% in the area around the [[Pamlico Sound]], 23% in [[Virginia]], and about 15% in [[Maryland]].<ref name="assess">{{cite web|author=Post, Buckley, Schuh and Jernigan|year=2005|title=Hurricane Isabel Assessment, a Review of Hurricane Evacuation Study Products and Other Aspects of the National Hurricane Mitigation and Preparedness Program (NHMPP) in the Context of the Hurricane Isabel Response|publisher=[[NOAA]]|accessdate=2006-11-27|url=http://www.csc.noaa.gov/hes/docs/postStorm/Isabel_PostStorm_Summary.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref> The threat of Isabel resulted in the evacuation of hundreds of thousands of residents, primarily in North Carolina and Virginia, and included more than 12,000&nbsp;residents staying in emergency shelters.<ref name="scotsman">{{cite web|author=Scotsman.com|year=2003|title=America feels the wrath of Isabel|accessdate=2007-02-11|url=http://news.scotsman.com/topics.cfm?tid=980&id=1037902003}}</ref>

19 major airports along the [[East Coast of the United States]] were closed, with more than 1,500&nbsp;flights canceled. The [[Washington Metro]] and [[Metrobus (Washington, D.C.)|Metrobus]] system closed prior to the arrival of the storm, and [[Amtrak]] canceled nearly all trains south of the nation's capital. Schools and businesses throughout its path closed prior to Isabel's arrival to allow time to prepare; hardware and home improvement stores reported brisk business of plywood, flashlights, batteries, and portable generators, as residents prepared for the storm's potential impact.

Strong winds from Isabel extended from [[North Carolina]] to [[New England]] and westward to [[West Virginia]]. The winds, combined with previous rainfall which moistened the soil, downed many trees and power lines across its path, leaving about 6&nbsp;million electricity customers without power at some point. Parts of coastal [[Virginia]], especially in the [[Hampton Roads]] and Northeast [[North Carolina]] areas, were without [[electricity]] for almost a month. Coastal areas suffered from waves and its powerful storm surge, with areas in eastern North Carolina and southeast [[Virginia]] reporting severe damage from both winds and the storm surge. Throughout its path, Isabel resulted in $3.6&nbsp;billion in damage (2003&nbsp;USD, ${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|3600000000|2003}}}} {{#time:Y}}&nbsp;USD) and 51&nbsp;deaths, of which 16 were directly related to the storm's effects.<ref name="assess">{{cite web|author=United States Department of Commerce|year=2004|title=Service Assessment of Hurricane Isabel|publisher=NOAA|accessdate=2007-02-10|url=http://www.weather.gov/os/assessments/pdfs/isabel.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref>

Powerful surf affected the northern coastlines of the islands in the [[Greater Antilles]]. Strong swells also lashed the [[Bahamas]]. During most hurricanes, the location of the Bahamas prevents powerful swells of Atlantic hurricanes from striking southeast [[Florida]].

About 1.24&nbsp;million people lost power throughout [[Maryland]] and [[Washington, D.C.]] The worst of Isabel's effects came from its storm surge, which inundated areas along the coast and resulted in severe beach erosion. In [[Eastern Shore of Maryland|Eastern Maryland]], hundreds of buildings were damaged or destroyed by the storm surge and related tidal flooding. The most severe flooding occurred in the southern portions of Dorchester and Somerset counties and on Kent Island in Queen Anne's County.

The disaster declaration allocated the use of federal funds for rebuilding and providing aid in the aftermath of hurricane Isabel.<ref name="assess"/> By about four months after the passage of the hurricane, disaster aid totaled about $516&nbsp;million (2003&nbsp;USD, $576.3&nbsp;million 2007&nbsp;USD), primarily in North Carolina and Virginia. Over 166,000 residents applied for individual assistance, with about $117&nbsp;million (2003&nbsp;USD, $130&nbsp;million) approved for residents to assist with temporary housing and home repairs. About 50,000&nbsp;business owners applied for Small Business Administration loans, with about $178&nbsp;million (2003&nbsp;USD, $199&nbsp;million 2007&nbsp;USD) approved for the assistance loans.
