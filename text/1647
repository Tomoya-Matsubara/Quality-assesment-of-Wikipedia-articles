The '''Victims of Terrorist Attack on the Pentagon Memorial''' is a [[memorial]] over a group burial site at [[Arlington National Cemetery]] in the United States. It commemorates the victims of the [[September 11 attacks|September 11 attack]] on [[The Pentagon]]. The memorial specifically honors the five individuals for whom no identifiable remains were found.<ref name="Cass" /> However, a portion of the remains of 25 other victims are buried at the site.<ref name="Honors" /> The names of the 125 Pentagon employees,<ref>{{cite web|title=September 11, A Memorial: Pentagon|url=http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2001/memorial/lists/by-location/page88.html|publisher=CNN|accessdate=31 October 2012}}</ref> as well as the 59 non-terrorist individuals (53 non-terrorist passengers and 6 crewmembers) aboard [[American Airlines Flight 77]] (which crashed into the building) are inscribed on the memorial.<ref>{{cite web|title=September 11, A Memorial: AA Flight 77|url=http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2001/memorial/lists/by-location/page96.html|publisher=CNN|accessdate=31 October 2012}}</ref> 

==Creation of the memorial==
[[File:USS Serpens Memorial - Arlington National Cemetery - west view - 2011.jpg|thumb|left|Memorial to the 253 dead of the ''USS Serpens'', which inspired the Pentagon victims' memorial.]]
After the 2001 terrorist attack on the Pentagon, Arlington National Cemetery Superintendent [[John C. Metzler, Jr.]] realized that there was a strong likelihood that many of the victims might not have their remains identified, while other remains might be commingled.<ref name="Wilbert">{{cite web |title=9/12 <U+2013> A New Day to Remember |url=http://www.eloquentarrow.com/pdfs/gallery/9_12.pdf|publisher=Wilbert Funeral Services|accessdate=31 October 2012|date=February 3, 2005}}</ref> Many of the victims would be military personnel whose families could choose to have their loved ones buried at Arlington. This would necessitate a group burial at the cemetery, and an appropriate monument to mark the grave.

Metzler designed the memorial himself.  He drew inspiration from the memorial to the 253 dead of the [[United States Coast Guard]] ship [[USS Serpens (AK-97)|USS ''Serpens'']], which is located in the northern corner of Section 34 at Arlington National Cemetery.<ref name="Wilbert" /> The ''Serpens'' memorial is octagonal in shape and lists the names of the dead on its side panels.<ref>{{cite book|title=The New Book of Knowledge|year=1989|publisher=Grolier Inc|location=Danbury, Conn|isbn=0-7172-0520-7|page=26|quote=It was dedicated on November 16, 1950.}}</ref>

The Victims of Terrorist Attack on the Pentagon Memorial is a pentagonal [[granite]] marker {{convert|4.5|ft|m}} high.<ref name="Pusey">{{cite news |title=Final Service Honors Victims of Pentagon Attack |first= Allen|last= Pusey|newspaper=Dallas Morning News|date=September 13, 2002}}</ref><ref name="Cass">{{cite news |last=Cass|first=Connie|title=Cremated Remains of Pentagon Victims Are Laid to Rest at National Cemetery|date=September 13, 2002|agency=[[Associated Press]]}}</ref> On five sides of the memorial along the top are inscribed the words "Victims of Terrorist Attack on the Pentagon September 11, 2001".

The [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs]] commissioned the memorial.<ref name="KnoxNews"/> Granite Industries of Vermont, Inc., of [[Washington County, Vermont]], provided the marker.<ref name="Mehren">{{cite news |last=Mehren |first=Elizabeth |title=Headstone Carvers Find Ages of the Fallen Hard to Take at Times|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2004/sep/14/nation/na-stones14|accessdate=31 October 2012|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=September 14, 2004}}</ref> (The company is also the sole provider of headstones for Arlington National Cemetery.)<ref name="Mehren" /> The stone was quarried near [[Danby, Vermont]], at a site {{convert|920|ft|m}} underground and {{convert|1.25|mi|km}} inside a mountain.<ref name="Mehren" /> Michael E. Cappetta, a stoneworker with Granite Industries, sculpted the marker.<ref name="Pusey" /> It was shipped on or about August 20, 2002, to the cemetery.<ref name="KnoxNews" />

==Identification of the dead==
Identifying remains at the Pentagon was a lengthy and technically complex task.  The speed at which the aircraft struck the building, as well as the intensity of the subsequent fire, left few human remains to be found.<ref name="VogelNever">{{cite news|last=Vogel|first=Steve|title=Lost and, Sometimes, Never Found|url=http://www.arlingtoncemetery.net/never-found.htm|accessdate=31 October 2012|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|date=September 13, 2002}}</ref> Furthermore, the fire so damaged the [[DNA]] in some remains that they were impossible to identify.<ref name="VogelNever" />

However, DNA analysis helped to identify many of the dead. Human remains were taken to a military mortuary at [[Dover Air Force Base]] in [[Delaware]].<ref name="VogelFacing" /> The [[Armed Forces Institute of Pathology]] conducted the DNA analysis.<ref name="Struggle">{{cite news|title=Officials struggle with decisions on remains of hijackers|url=http://chronicle.augusta.com/stories/2002/09/11/nat_351973.shtml|accessdate=31 October 2012|newspaper=[[The Augusta Chronicle]]|date=September 11, 2002|agency=Associated Press}}</ref> [[Polymerase chain reaction]] was used to amplify the amount of usable DNA.  The [[United States Department of Defense]] had previously collected "bloodstain cards" from all its civilian and military employees, and the DNA on these cards was used to identify many remains.<ref name="MurrayLost">{{cite news|last=Murray|first=Frank J.|title=Remembering lives of Pentagon's 'lost' |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-91001656.html|accessdate=31 October 2012|newspaper=[[The Washington Times]]|date=September 3, 2002}}</ref> Families of those aboard Flight 77 provided DNA samples (from commonplace household items like combs or toothbrushes) for use in identifying their loved ones.<ref name="Cass" />

Not all the victims of the terrorist attack on the Pentagon qualified for burial at Arlington National Cemetery.  Families of those who did often chose to bury the remains of their loved ones at a private cemetery.  Sixty-four individuals who died at the Pentagon were buried at Arlington, and 57 of them were interred in Section 64,<ref name="VogelNever" /> their headstones facing the Pentagon about {{convert|1100|ft|m}} away to the southeast (visible through a few trees).<ref>{{cite news |last=Murphy |first=Dean E.|title=A Single Grief Knits Together A Vast Country |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/12/us/vigilance-memory-observances-single-grief-knits-together-vast-country.html|accessdate=31 October 2012|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=September 12, 2002}}</ref>

No remains could be identified for five victims:<ref name="Cass" />
#Dana Falkenberg, age three, who was aboard American Airlines Flight 77 with her parents and older sister.
#Colonel Ronald Golinski ([[United States Army]], retired), age 60, a civilian worker at the Pentagon.
#Electronics Technician 1st Class Ronald Hemenway ([[United States Navy]]), age 37.
#James T. Lynch, age 55, a civilian video technician for the U.S. Navy.
#Rhonda Rasmussen, age 44, a civilian worker for the U.S. Army.

In some cases, additional remains were discovered and identified after a person had already been buried by their families.  Some families chose to add these remains to an existing grave.  But 25 families chose to have these fragments interred during the group burial rather than disinter their loved ones or hold a second memorial service.<ref name="Cass" /><ref name="VogelFacing" /> The additional remains were cremated, mixed together, and placed in an urn which in turn was placed inside a single wooden coffin.<ref name="Honors">{{cite web|title=Arlington funeral honors unidentified victims |url=http://articles.cnn.com/2002-09-12/us/ar911.pentagon.funeral_1_dana-falkenberg-ronald-golinski-victims?_s=PM:US|publisher=[[CNN]]|accessdate=31 October 2012|date=September 12, 2002}}</ref> 

Five sets of remains were found but could not be identified.  Military officials say that, by a process of elimination, they believed these remains to be those of the hijackers.<ref name="VogelFacing">{{cite news |last=Vogel |first=Steve|title=Facing the Scene of Disaster; 9/11 Service Planned at Rebuilt Pentagon Wall, But Pain Will Keep Some Victims' Families Away |url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/158054921.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=Sep+1%2C+2002&author=Steve+Vogel&pub=The+Washington+Post&edition=&startpage=C.01&desc=Facing+the+Scene+of+Disaster%3B+9%2F11+Service+Planned+at+Rebuilt+Pentagon+Wall%2C+But+Pain+Will+Keep+Some+Victims%27+Families+Away|accessdate=31 October 2012|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=September 1, 2002}}</ref><ref name="Struggle" /> [[United States Army Military District of Washington|Army Military District of Washington]] officials said the remains which were inextricably commingled were excluded from the burial so that there was no possibility that any terrorist remains were included.<ref name="Honors" /> These terrorist and commingled remains were turned over to the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) in February 2002.<ref name="Struggle" /> The FBI said the remains were "disposed of in a dignified manner'",<ref name="VogelNever" /> although a very small amount of suspected terrorist remains were retained to aid in later criminal prosecutions.<ref name="Struggle" />

==Dedication==
The Victims of Terrorist Attack on the Pentagon Memorial was dedicated on September 12, 2002.<ref name="Cass" />

A funeral service for the 30 victims was held at the [[Arlington Memorial Amphitheater]], the first time the amphitheater had held such a service since the interment of an unknown member of the armed forces representing Vietnam War dead in 1984.<ref name="VogelFacing" /> About 1,000 relatives attended the funeral service.<ref name="Cass" /> The funeral was held the day after the one-year anniversary of the September 11 attacks.  Many of these families felt the emotional strain was too much for two days of remembrances, and so chose not to attend the funeral.<ref name="VogelNever" /> The September 12 funeral focused on the families of five victims whose remains could not be identified, although all victims were memorialized.<ref name="VogelFacing" /> [[United States Secretary of Defense]] [[Donald Rumsfeld]] and chaplains from each branch of the United States armed forces spoke, and [[United States Air Force]] General [[Richard Myers]], chairman of the [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]], attended.<ref name="Cass" /> The [[United States Navy Band]] provided music.<ref name="Garamone">{{cite news|last=Garamone|first=Jim|title=Remains of Pentagon Attack Victims Buried at Arlington |url=http://osd.dtic.mil/news/Sep2002/n09122002_200209123.html|accessdate=31 October 2012|newspaper=DefenseLINK News|date=September 12, 2002|agency=[[American Forces Press Service]]}}</ref>

After the funeral, the casket was carried from the amphitheater by an Armed Forces casket team composed of two representatives from each of the four branches of the United States military.<ref name="VogelNever" /> The casket team carried the coffin to a horse-drawn [[Limbers and caissons|caisson]] provided by and guided by the [[3rd US Infantry Regiment (The Old Guard)]].<ref name="Garamone" /> The [[United States Army Band]], an Army-Air Force [[honor guard]] [[platoon]], a [[color guard]] from all four services, and a Navy-[[United States Marine Corps|Marine]] honor guard platoon led the caisson to the grave site.<ref name="VogelNever" />

The group burial site is located at the southern end of Section 64, near Patton Circle.  The site is on a slight rise, which gives it a view of the Pentagon.<ref name="Cass" /> Several hundred people attended the graveside service.<ref name="Cass" /> Wilbert Funeral Services of [[Laurel, Maryland]], provided a burial vault.  The grave was dug several days in advance, a [[concrete]] foundation for the memorial laid, and a specially-constructed [[Burial vault (enclosure)|burial vault]] placed on the foundation.<ref name="Wilbert" /> The vault had a concrete core surrounded by three layers of bronze.<ref name="Wilbert" /> It was lined with high-impact plastic, and the exterior encased in [[Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene|ABS plastic]] to simulate marble.<ref name="Wilbert" /> The seal of the U.S. Department of Defense and the name of the memorial was inscribed on the cover of the burial vault using a special process.<ref name="Wilbert" /> Near the grave was the memorial itself, next to which was displayed a funeral wreath in the shape of a pentagon and made from 184 red carnations.<ref name="VogelNever" />

A rifle party gave a [[three-volley salute]], and a [[bugle]]r provided by the Navy played ''[[Taps]]''.<ref name="VogelNever" /> The casket team secured and folded the American flag while the Army Band played ''[[America the Beautiful]]''.<ref name="VogelNever" /> General Myers accepted the flag on behalf of the Pentagon.<ref name="Garamone" /> Grief counselors from Operation Solace (a group founded to assist the families of victims of the 9/11 attacks) were present to assist families after the service.<ref name="Pusey" />

The memorial was installed over the group burial site about a week later.<ref name="Cass" /> The burial vault was locked, concrete was poured over the vault to fill the grave, and the memorial emplaced once the concrete set.

Ponsford, Ltd., a company which provides conservation and curatorial services, maintains the monument and keeps it clean (as it does for all the monuments at Arlington National Cemetery).<ref>{{cite web |title=Pentagon Victims Memorial |url=http://www.statueconservation.com/conservation_restoration/pentagon.htm|publisher=Ponsford Ltd|accessdate=31 October 2012|year=2003}}</ref>

==Assessment of the memorial==
[[File:Arlington National Cemetery - 9-11 Memorial to Pentagon Victims - SW side with tombstones - 2011.jpg|thumb|The memorial days before the 10th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks.]]
The monument has not received much attention.  A critic for ''[[The Washington Times]]'', however, approvingly called it a "five-sided [[Rock of Ages (Christian hymn)|Rock of Ages]]".<ref name="MurrayLost" /> [[Paul Goldberger]], architecture critic for ''[[The New Yorker]]'' magazine, was more cautious. By inscribing the name of each victim, he said, the memorial risks becoming a private monument rather than a monument belonging to the entire nation or a symbol of something larger than an individual person.<ref>{{cite news |title=Planners Seek to Communicate Beyond Grief to Next Generation |first=Kyle |last=MacMillan |newspaper=[[The Denver Post]]|date= August 25, 2002}}</ref>

==History of the memorial==
At about 10:20 A.M. on June 20, 2014, a man committed suicide by shooting himself near the Victims of Terrorist Attack on the Pentagon Memorial. Dozens of police vehicles from the Arlington County Police Department, cemetery security, Fort Myer security, and other federal agencies converged on the scene.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.military.com/daily-news/2014/06/20/man-kills-himself-at-arlington-national-cemetery.html|last=McGarry|first=Brendan|title=Man Kills Himself at Arlington National Cemetery|website=Military.com|date=June 20, 2014|accessdate=June 20, 2104}}</ref> Cemetery officials said there were no eyewitnesses to the suicide, but were unable to ascertain if he was a veteran.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/man-dies-of-self-inflicted-gunshot-at-arlington-cemetery/2014/06/20/642d5410-f890-11e3-a3a5-42be35962a52_story.html|last=St. Martin|first=Victoria|title=Man Dies of Self-Inflicted Gunshot at Arlington Cemetery|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=June 20, 2014|accessdate=June 21, 2014}}</ref>
