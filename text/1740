'''Henry Theodore Wade-Gery''', generally known as '''Theodore''' ([[2 April]] [[1888]], Campton Grange near [[Shefford, Bedfordshire|Shefford]], [[Bedfordshire]] <U+2013> [[2 January]] [[1972]], [[Oxford]]) was a classical scholar, historian and [[epigrapher]], and [[Wykeham Professor of Ancient History]] in the [[University of Oxford]].

==Life==
Born into a long-established Bedfordshire family, he was educated at [[Winchester College]], a contemporary of [[Arnold J. Toynbee]] and [[R.M.Y. Gleadowe]], and at [[New College, Oxford]], which he left with a First in Classical Moderations in 1911. After a short spell in the [[Civil Service]] he was offered a Fellowship in 1914 at [[Wadham College, Oxford|Wadham College]].

Almost immediately however he left for military service in [[World War I]] in the army on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]], during which he was awarded the [[Military Cross|MC]].

After the end of the war he returned to Wadham, eventually becoming Sub-Warden. In 1928 he married Vivian Westfield, an archaeologist. They had one son, Robert (now Sir Robert) Wade-Gery, born in 1929.

Wade-Gery remained at Wadham until 1939, when on his election as [[Wykeham Professor of Ancient History]] he became a Fellow of [[New College, Oxford|New College]]. In 1941 he was elected a Fellow of the [[British Academy]].

He retired from his Chair in 1953 and was offered a five-year Research Fellowship at [[Merton College, Oxford|Merton College]], two years of which he spent at [[Princeton University|Princeton]]. For the next ten years or so he continued to travel and to write (his last publication was in 1966) until after a few years of declining health he died of a heart attack in 1972.

==Works==
In 1915 three of his poems were published in that year's "Oxford Poetry" volume <ref>http://www.gnelson.demon.co.uk/oxpoetry/index/iw.html Oxford Poetry website</ref>, in which work by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] also appeared. After his safe return from the war he published "Terpsichore and Other Poems", a collection of his poetry, in 1922, but future publications were devoted to his academic work and especially to [[epigraphy]].

His writing was mostly in the form of articles in learned journals. 
His principal publications were: 
* ''Pindar: Pythian Odes'', 1928 (Nonesuch Press), jointly with [[Maurice Bowra]];
* ''The Athenian Tribute Lists'' (4 vols), 1939-53 (American School of Classical Studies at Athens), as a joint author with Benjamin D. Meritt and Malcolm F. McGregor;
