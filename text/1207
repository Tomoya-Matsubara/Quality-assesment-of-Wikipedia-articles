'''Abatte Barihun''' ({{lang-he|'''<U+05D0><U+05D1><U+05D8><U+05D4> <U+05D1><U+05E8><U+05D9><U+05D4><U+05D5><U+05DF>'''}}) (born 1967, [[Addis Ababa]]) is an [[Israel]]i [[jazz]] [[saxophonist]] and [[composer]]. His sound is reminiscent of [[John Coltrane]]'s, who has highly influenced Barihun.<ref name="Shalev" /><ref name="Israeli" /><ref name="Holmes" /><ref name="Laurence" />

== Early life and career (1967<U+2013>1999) ==
Barihun was born in [[Addis Ababa]], the [[capital city]] of [[Ethiopia]]. His house resided next to the [[music school]] of [[Addis Ababa University]], as well as a nearby [[military base]]. Young Barihun fell for the [[March (music)|march]] sound of the saxophones and other [[wind instrument]]s emerging from the neighbouring military [[brass band]]. He got a saxophone and joined the music school, where he was exposed to [[Western world|Western]] Jazz albums of [[Charlie Parker]] and others.<ref name="Davis">Barry Davis, [http://www.bluesforpeace.com/jpost_1.8.2002.htm '''Ras Jazz'''], [[Jerusalem Post]], August 1st 2002</ref>

By the age of 16, Barihun joined the Ethiopian [[Military band]], with which he toured through Ethiopia and the [[Eastern Bloc]]. [[Mengistu Haile Mariam]] once sent him to play at [[Kim Il-sung]]'s birthday in [[North Korea]].<ref>Interview with [[Moshe Bar-Yuda]], 30 March 2009.</ref> This period in his life came to an abrupt end six years later, when the band's bus was [[ambush]]ed by [[EPRDF]] forces, rebelling against Mengistu's [[Marxist dictatorship]]. Most band members were killed in the prolonged attack, and Barihun was [[wound]]ed by two [[bullet]]s.<ref name="Shalev" >Ben Shalev, [http://www.mouse.co.il/CM.articles_item,679,209,2055,.aspx Abatte comes back home], [[Haaretz]] 16.5.2006 (Hebrew)</ref>

For eight years Barihun kept playing every night at the [[Hilton Hotels|Hilton]] and [[Sheraton Hotels and Resorts|Sheraton]] hotels of Addis Ababa.<ref name="Davis" /> He also played in the [[Ethiopian National Theater]] and toured with [[Mahmoud Ahmed]].<ref name="Shalev" /> At the age of 21 he established his own Jazz band, with which he toured [[Europe]] three times a year. His last European tour ended merely three weeks before his [[aliyah]] to Israel.<ref name="Davis" />

== Home coming ==
Barihun joined his family in Israel on 1999, leaving behind his ex-wife and their son Nahum.<ref name="Shalev" /> His dream - being a musician in Israel - has proven difficult to realize.<ref name="Barihun">Abatte Barihun, liner notes for the album '''Ras Deshen''', 2005</ref> Facing a [[language barrier]] and the burden of [[alimony]], Barihun worked as a [[dishwashing|dishwasher]] in a [[restaurant]] through the day and as a night [[security guard]]. His fingers were [[Chemical burn|burned]] by [[dishwashing detergent]]s, hindering his practice with his saxophones.<ref name="Davis" /><ref name="Sanbetto">Inao Freda-Sanbetto, [http://www.haaretz.co.il/hasite/pages/ShArtPE.jhtml?itemNo=691849 '''Operation Moses'''], [[Haaretz]] 11 March 2006 (Hebrew)</ref> He was discovered by [[Moshe Bar-Yuda]], then head of the [[TOMER]] [[NGO]], and formerly (1957) one of the first Israeli [[Shaliach|emissaries]] to [[Beta Israel]] communities. Bar Yuda brought Barihun together with [[musicologist]] Shlomo Israeli, who was deeply touched by Barihun's playing.<ref name="Israeli">Shlomo Israeli, liner notes for the album '''Ras Deshen''', 2005</ref> Israeli paired Barihun with jazz pianist [[Yitzhak Yedid]], a successful match that gave rise to the "Ras Deshen Ensemble".

== Ras Deshen ==
Barihun and Yedid's ensemble is named after the [[Amharic]] name of [[Ras Dashen]] mountain, the highest mountain in Ethiopia. Ras Dashen belongs to the rugged [[Semien Mountains]], where [[Ethiopian Jews]] defended themselves against [[Persecution of Jews|persecutions]] by the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church|Christian]] [[Emperor of Ethiopia|Emperors of Ethiopia]] through the 14th-17th [[Century|Centuries]].<ref name="Encyc553">Steven Kaplan, "Bet<U+00E4> <U+018F>sra<U+02BE>el", in Siegbert von Uhlig, ed., ''Encyclopaedia Aethiopica: A-C'' (Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz Verlag, 2003), p.553.</ref><ref name="PankBord78">Pankhurst, Richard. ''The Ethiopian Borderlands: Essays in Regional History from Ancient Times to the End of the 18th Century'' (Asmara, Eritrea: The Red Sea, Inc., 1997), pp.78-79.</ref> Ras Deshen's premiere concert took place in September 2001 on a [[Festival]] in [[Tel Aviv]]. On September 2002 the duo recorded its self-titular maiden [[album]], which was released on 2004. The album was hailed by [[music critic]]s and was rated among the two best Israeli jazz albums of the year.<ref name="Holmes">Terrell Kent Holmes, [http://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/review_print.php?id=20760 '''Ras Deshen: From Ethiopian Music to Contemporary Jazz'''], All About Jazz</ref><ref name="Sanbetto" /><ref name="DMG" />

The album contains eight [[Track (song)|pieces]] which blend [[free jazz]] with four [[musical mode]]s used in the [[Ethiopian Highlands]], comprising the unique [[Music of Ethiopia#Music theory|qenet]] modal system.<ref name=Grove356>{{NewGrove2001|Ethiopia|Shelemay, Kay Kaufman|viii|p. 356}}</ref> Three of these modes - Bati, Tezeta and Ambassel - originate from the [[Wollo]] region in the Ethiopian Highlands, where most of the Jewish community has concentrated.<ref name="Bar-Yuda">[[Moshe Bar-Yuda]], liner notes for the album '''Ras Deshen''', 2005</ref> The fourth mode, Anchi Hoye, is used in [[religious music]].

=== Anchi Hoye ===
Anchi Hoye mode is used for prayers in the Masgid, which is the Jewish Ethiopian [[Synagogue]], as well as in the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church]]. It is also used in [[wedding music]], as well as in [[courting]] songs, [[love song]]s and even [[battle song]]s.<ref name="Barihun" /> Two tracks in the album are composed in this mode: Anchi Hoye and Nafkote.

'''Anchi Hoye''', the opening track, was composed by Barihun, reflecting his deep feelings for his beloved. Barihun's [[tenor saxophone]] opens with a style referencing both [[John Coltrane]] and [[Lester Young]]. Four minutes into the song comes a [[piano solo]] by Yedid, which was described as "so reminiscent of [[Keith Jarrett]] that his solo could be dropped seamlessly into the grooves of [[The K<U+00F6>ln Concert]]".<ref name="Holmes" />

'''Nafkote''', the sixth track, is a traditional [[Saudade|longing]] song. Here Barihun first [[Singing|sings]] in [[Amharic]], a feat he has not practiced back in Ethiopia.<ref name="Shalev" /> Yedid's piano traces the [[rhythm]] for about two minutes, then starts improvising on the [[Musical scale|scale]]. About a minute later Barihun improvises on top of Yedid's piano for about two minutes, then concludes with the traditional song.

=== Bati ===
[[Bati, Ethiopia|Bati]] is a [[market town]] in the southern part of Wollo, in the [[Oromia Zone]], between the [[Ethiopian highlands]] and the [[Great Rift Valley]]. The musical mode named after it is used in [[praise song]]s for [[monarch|rulers]] and [[wise old man|sages]], as well as in yearning songs for a beloved.<ref name="Barihun" /> Two tracks in the album are composed in this mode: Bati and Birtukane.

'''Bati''' is a traditional song, telling of a man longing for his beloved woman, and going after her to Bati. The [[western world|western]] listener may be familiar with this song from [[Ethiopiques]] Volume 15, which opens with a pounding performance of this song. Barihun and Yedid formulate a contemplative [[arrangement]] for this composition, which preserves its original mode. The piano silently accompanies Barihun's sobbing [[soprano sax]], then his singing. Towards the fifth minute Yedid interprets the piece on his piano, to which Barihun joins for a penetrating [[Duet (music)|duet]]. The composition ends with Barihun's singing, sealed with a sigh.

'''Birtukane''', "my orange", is a traditional longing song to the family and loved ones who are far away. [[Krar]] player Fentahon Malessa accompanies Barihun's improvisations on the saxophone, in an instrumental variation of [[Assafe Abatte]]'s melody, in Bati-minor mode.

=== Tezeta ===
Tezeta literally means [[nostalgia]], a bittersweet longing for the past.<ref>Tezeta definition taken from the website http://tezeta.net dedicated to Ethiopian compositions</ref> Tezeta mode is used to express dreams, wishes and yearnings. [[Ethiopian Jews]] used this mode to express their yearning to [[Jerusalem]] and the [[Land of Israel]]. After [[aliyah|coming]] to Israel, this mode has been used to express nostalgia to Ethiopia. Some love and wedding songs were also composed in this mode, that originates from the Wollo region.<ref name="Barihun" /> Barihun & Yedid excel at performing the two pieces composed in this mode: Yehar Shererit and Fikir.<ref name="Holmes" />

'''Yehar Shererit''', "[[Spider web]]", is a traditional song describing the difficult life of the [[spider]], endlessly weaving its artistic [[Spider silk|silky]] web. Its melody, composed by singer [[Hirut Bekele]] in Tezeta-minor mode, is served in an instrumental arrangement. The dramatic element of the composition is steadily built, from the opening piano tap to the tenor groans at the fourth minute. The first peak of the duet leads to a brief piano session, after which the saxophone clears its path to a touching exhibition of creativity to the end of the composition. Multiple brilliant instants are packed into these seven short minutes, illustrating that the mutual inspiration between Barihun and Yedid yields their most fascinating moments. Music critic [[Terrell Kent Holmes|T.K. Holmes]] has remarked that Abbate's tenor "has a palpable [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]]/[[gospel music|gospel]] tinge, with an occasional [[gutbucket]] growl added for good measure, working in tandem with Yedid<U+2019>s playful [[boogie-woogie]] chaos".<ref name="Holmes" />

'''Fikir''', "Love", was composed by [[Tilahun Gessesse]] in Tezeta-minor mode. It utters the wonder of love that is beyond words. Yedid first accompanies Barihun's tenor for about 3.5 minutes, followed by Barihun's chant. A piano solo then follows, over which the saxophone swirls into a rich expression of love. An additional cycle of singing then seals the composition. Downtown Music Gallery has commented on this tune that Barihun "reaches even deeper into the his heart and soul and sings this touching piece sublime spirit".<ref name="DMG" >{{cite web |url=http://downtownmusicgallery.com/Main/news/Newsletter-2006-02-17.html |title=Newsletter February 17th, 2006|work=Downtown Music Gallery |first=Bruce Lee |last=Gallanter |accessdate=2008-02-15}}</ref>

=== Ambassel ===
[[Ambassel]] is a mountain [[castle|fortress]] ruled by the [[Jantirar]], and a [[woreda]] named after it in [[Wollo]] region. Ambassel district raised many musicians and music lovers. Ambassel mode is used for singing historical and traditional tales and for [[children's song]]s. Its popularity throughout Ethiopia grew as [[Menen Asfaw|Empress Menen Asfaw]], the daughter of Jantirar [[Asfaw]], became consort of Emperor [[Haile Selassie]].<ref name="Barihun" />

'''Ambassel''', the seventh piece in the album, is a traditional tune upon which the singer improvises stories of his emotions, or historical tales. Here Fentahon Malessa's [[Krar]] accompanies player Barihun's improvisations on the saxophone, leaving the listener to imagine the musical tales that could have been embroidered by Barihun, Yedid and Malessa together.<ref name="Holmes" />

=== Behatito Kadus Kadus ===
The ending song of the album is an adaptation of a [[Jewish services|prayer]] sung on [[Shacharit]] of [[Yom Kippur]] and other [[Jewish holiday]]s. Its name '''Behatito Kadus Kadus''' - "You alone are holy holy" in [[Ge'ez]] - reflects the persistent belief of [[Beta Israel|Ethiopian Jews]] in the [[Jewish principles of faith#God is One|unity of God]], in face of the surrounding belief in the [[trinity]]. The prayer, in the [[sacred language]] [[Ge'ez]], has different versions for [[Shalosh regalim]] and for the [[High Holy Days]].<ref name="Sanbetto" /> Traditionally it is sung by six [[Kessim]] repeatedly answering one of them ("Behatito" - "Kadus Kadus!"). In the album Barihun sings it as a personal ode, while perserving the original melody which is surprisingly reminiscent of the [[Blues]]. At the third minute Yedid [[Vamp (music)|vamps]] like [[Fats Waller]], as Barihun's tenor Sax "grooves between Ethiopia and the Mississippi Delta".<ref name="Holmes" /> The [[New Orleans]]ian tinge and piercing theme have made it popular among the [[Israel]]i and [[Western world|Western]] audience alike.<ref name="Holmes" /><ref name="Shalev2" />

=== Psalms ===
On December 2005 Ras Deshen launched a new concert titled "Psalms" ("<U+05DE><U+05D6><U+05DE><U+05D5><U+05E8><U+05D9> <U+05EA><U+05D4><U+05DC><U+05D9><U+05DD>"). It consists of nine pieces based on [[Kessim]] [[chant]]s, consolidated into a [[suite]].<ref name="Shalev2">Ben Shalev, [http://www.haaretz.co.il/hasite/pages/ShArtPE.jhtml?itemNo=660605 '''Chant of the Kes'''], [[Haaretz]] 21.12.2005 (Hebrew)</ref> The duo is joined by singer [[Esther Keinan-Ofri]], [[drummer]] Tegen Zenba, [[Double bass|Contrabassist]] Ora Boazsson-Chorev and [[dancer]] Tezeta.<ref>[http://bidur.index.co.il/siteFiles/1/23/242757.asp?gate_id=239902 Psalms concert] (Hebrew)</ref> Composed by Barihun, Yedid and Keinan-Ofri, it blends [[Israeli music|Israeli]], [[Arabic music|Arabic]] and [[classical music|Western]] elements with the corresponding Kessim chants.

== Kuluma ==
