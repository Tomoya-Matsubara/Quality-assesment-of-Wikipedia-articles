'''HMS ''Diamond''''' (H22) was a [[C and D class destroyer|D-class]] [[destroyer]] built for the [[Royal Navy]] in the early 1930s. The ship spent the bulk of her career on the [[China Station]]. She was briefly assigned to the [[Mediterranean Fleet]] in 1939 before she was transferred to [[West Africa]] for convoy escort duties. ''Diamond'' returned to the Mediterranean Fleet in early 1940 where she generally escorted convoys to and from [[Malta]]. The ship participated in the [[Battle of Cape Spartivento]] in November. ''Diamond'' was sunk by German aircraft on 27 April 1941 whilst [[Battle of Greece|evacuating]] [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] troops from [[Greece]].

==Description==
''Diamond'' displaced {{convert|1375|LT|MT|lk=on}} at [[Displacement (ship)|standard]] load and {{convert|1890|LT|MT}} at [[deep load]]. The ship had an [[length overall|overall length]] of {{convert|329|ft|m|1}}, a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|33|ft|m|1}} and a [[draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|12|ft|6|in|m|1}}. She was powered by [[Parsons Marine Steam Turbine Company|Parsons]] geared [[steam turbine]]s, driving two shafts, which developed a total of {{convert|36000|shp|lk=on}} and gave a maximum speed of {{convert|36|kn|lk=on}}. Steam for the turbines was provided by three Admiralty 3-drum [[water-tube boiler]]s. ''Diamond'' carried a maximum of {{convert|473|LT|t}} of [[fuel oil]] that gave her a range of {{convert|5870|nmi|lk=on}} at {{convert|15|kn}}. The ship's complement was 145 officers and men.<ref name=w78>Whitley, p. 102</ref>

The ship mounted four 45-[[caliber (artillery)|calibre]] [[4.7 inch QF Mark XII|4.7-inch (120&nbsp;mm) Mark IX guns]] in single mounts. For [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] (AA) defence, ''Diamond'' had a single 12-pounder (3&nbsp;in (76.2&nbsp;mm)) gun between her [[funnel (ship)|funnel]]s and two [[QF 2 pounder naval gun|QF 2 pdr (40&nbsp;mm) Mk II]] guns mounted on the side of her [[bridge (nautical)|bridge]]. She was fitted with two above-water quadruple [[torpedo tube]] mounts for [[British 21 inch torpedo|{{convert|21|in|adj=on|0}}]] torpedoes.<ref>Friedman, pp. 215, 299</ref> One [[depth charge]] rail and two throwers were fitted; 20 depth charges were originally carried, but this increased to 35 shortly after the war began.<ref>English, p. 141</ref>

==Career==
''Diamond'' was ordered on 2 February 1931 under the 1930 Naval Estimates, and was laid down at [[Vickers-Armstrong]]'s yard at [[Barrow-in-Furness]] on 29 September 1931. She was launched on 8 April 1932 and completed on 3 November 1933, at a total cost of <U+00A3>223,509, excluding equipment supplied by the [[Admiralty]], such as weapons, ammunition and wireless equipment. The ship was initially assigned to the [[1st Destroyer Flotilla]] in the Mediterranean and made a brief deployment to the [[Persian Gulf]] and [[Red Sea]] in September<U+2013>November 1933. ''Diamond'' was refitted at [[HMNB Devonport|Devonport Dockyard]] between 3 September and 27 October 1934 for service on the China Station with the 8th (later the 21st) Destroyer [[Flotilla]] and arrived there in January 1935, where she remained for the next four years.<ref>English, pp. 51, 58</ref>

The ship began a refit at [[Singapore]] on 7 August 1939 and she was transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet after it was completed in November. ''Diamond'' arrived at Malta on 19 December, but she was transferred to the [[South Atlantic Division]] the following month. She departed Malta on 8 January 1940, bound for [[Freetown]] where she joined the [[20th Destroyer Division]] for escort duties. In April the ship returned to the Mediterranean where ''Diamond'' was assigned to the newly formed [[10th Destroyer Flotilla]] after a short refit at Malta.<ref>English, pp. 58<U+2013>59</ref>

She was slightly damaged by air attacks on 11 and 17 June near Malta after the Italians declared war on the Allies on 10 June.<ref name=e9>English, p. 59</ref> Together with her [[sister ship|sisters]] {{HMS|Dainty|H53|6}}, {{HMS|Defender|H07|6}}, the Australian destroyer {{HMAS|Stuart|D00|6}}, and the [[light cruiser]]s {{HMS|Capetown|D88|6}} and {{HMS|Liverpool|C11|6}}, she escorted Convoy AN.2 from [[Egypt]] to various ports in the [[Aegean Sea]] in late July.<ref>Rohwer, p. 35</ref> ''Diamond'' bombarded the Italian [[seaplane]] base at [[Bomba, Libya]] on 23 August.<ref name=e9/> A week later she escorted four transports to Malta with ''Dainty'' and the destroyers {{HMS|Jervis|F00|6}} and {{HMS|Juno|F46|6}} as part of [[Operation Hats]].<ref>Rohwer, p. 38</ref> The ship escorted Convoy MB.8 during [[Operation Collar (Convoy)|Operation Collar]].<ref name=e9/> After reaching Malta on 26 November, ''Diamond'' joined Force D and sailed to rendezvous with [[Force H]], coming from [[Gibraltar]]. The next day, after the British forces had combined, they were spotted by the Italians and the inconclusive Battle of Cape Spartivento was fought.<ref>O'Hara, pp. 65<U+2013>73</ref>

During [[Operation Excess]], ''Diamond'' and ''Defender'' escorted Convoy MW.5 to Malta in January 1941. The ship escorted a convoy of four freighters from Malta to Alexandria in mid-April. Shortly afterwards, she began evacuating Allied troops from Greece.<ref>Rohwer, pp. 56, 69, 70</ref> On 27 April 1941, ''Diamond'' and another destroyer, {{HMS|Wryneck|D21|6}}, rescued over 500 troops from the sinking Dutch [[troopship]], ''Slamat'', and set out for [[Crete]]. However, both ships were attacked and sunk about four hours later by German [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]] fighters and [[Junkers Ju 88]] [[bomber]]s.<ref>Shores, Cull and Malizi, pp. 295, 299</ref> Only one officer, 41 enlisted men and eight soldiers from all three ships were rescued.<ref name=e9/>
