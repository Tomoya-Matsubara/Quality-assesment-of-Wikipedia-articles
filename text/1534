'''Parque de la Abolicion''' (English: Abolition Park) is a city park in [[Ponce, Puerto Rico]].  It is the only park in the [[Caribbean]] dedicated to commemorating the abolition of [[slavery]].

==Location and features==
The park is located on Avenida Hostos at the fork of Salud Street and Marina Street.  The centerpiece of the park is a [[monument]] depicting a black male slave with broken chains depicting he is now a free man. A 100-foot high [[obelisk]], [[Monumento a la abolici<U+00F3>n de la exclavitud]], raises just behind the black iron [[sculpture]] of the freed slave that accentuates and gives instance to the occasion. The monument and obelisk are surrounded by graceful [[gardens]]. Immediately north of the obelisk is the outdoors [[Musical acoustics|acoustic]] [[amphitheater]] known as ''La Concha Acustica'' (English: The Acoustic Shell) which completes the park as a complete triangular city block. ''La Concha Acustica'' is an open-air auditorium used as a music venue, including presentations by the [[Ponce Municipal Band]]. ''La Concha Acustica'' can seat up to 2,000 people.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=KawuqbFxLS0C&pg=PT242 '''Explore Puerto Rico.''' By Harry S. Pariser. San Francisco: Manatee Press.

==History==
Slaves were brought to Puerto Rico from Africa from 1513 to the 18th century to replace the local Indian slaves who had been decimated.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yale.edu/gsp/colonial/puerto-rico/index.html |title=Puerto Rico &#124; Colonial Genocides &#124; Genocide Studies Program  |publisher=Yale University|date= |accessdate=2012-02-25}}</ref> The new slaves worked the [[coffee]], [[sugar cane]], and [[gold mining]] industries in Puerto Rico. During the 18th century, as gold mining ceased to be one of the major industries in Puerto Rico, slaves worked mostly in coffee plantations and sugar cane fields.  By royal proclamation slavery was abolished on March 22, 1873.

==Park creation==
In 1874, a year after the abolition of slavery, a group of citizens built a small park in memory of the historic event.  In 1880 [[Olimpio Otero]], Juan Mayoral Barn<U+00E9>s, and [[Rom<U+00E1>n Baldorioty de Castro]] were instrumental in creating the concept for a park dedicated to the commemorating the abolition of slavery, the only such memorial in the [[Caribbean]].<ref>[http://www.puertorico.com/blog/parque-de-la-abolicion-commemorating-the-end-of-an-era ''Parque de la Abolici<U+00F3>n - Commemorating the End of an Era.''] NewMedia Holdings, Inc. Retrieved 26 February 2012.</ref> Juan Mayoral Barn<U+00E9>s brought the idea for the creation of the park to the Ponce Municipal Assembly on March 14, 1880. It was unanimously approved by the Assembly, and ratified by the Central Government, and confirmed by Royal Decree on March 1, 1881.<ref>''Verdadera y Autentica Historia de la Ciudad de Ponce.''
