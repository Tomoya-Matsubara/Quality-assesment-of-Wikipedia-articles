The '''Getae'''  or '''Gets''' ({{lang-grc|<U+0393><U+03AD><U+03C4><U+03B1><U+03B9>}}, singular {{lang|grc|<U+0393><U+03AD><U+03C4><U+03B7><U+03C2>}}; {{lang-bg|''<U+0413><U+0435><U+0442><U+0438>''}}; {{lang-ro|Ge<U+0163>i}}) are names given to several [[Thracians|Thracian]] tribes inhabiting the regions to either side of the [[Danube|Lower Danube]], in what is today northern [[Bulgaria]] and southern [[Romania]]. Both the singular form '''Get''' and Getae may be derived from a Greek [[exonym]]: the area was the hinterland of Greek colonies on the [[Black Sea]] coast, bringing the Getae into contact with the [[Ancient Greeks]] from an early date.

== Getae and Dacians ==
{{See also|Dacians}}

=== Ancient sources ===
[[Strabo]], one of the first ancient sources to mention Getae and Dacians, stated in his ''[[Geographica]]'' (ca. 7 BC-20 AD) that the Dacians lived in the western parts of [[Dacia]], "towards [[Germania]] and the sources of the Danube", and the Getae in the eastern parts, towards the [[Black Sea]], both south and north of the Danube.{{sfn|Strabo|20 AD|loc=VII 3,13}} The ancient geographer also wrote that the Dacians and Getae spoke the same language,{{sfn|Strabo|20 AD|loc=VII 3,14}} after stating the same about Getae and Thracians.<ref name="cah3">{{cite book|title=The Cambridge Ancient History (Volume 3)|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1982|edition=2nd|isbn=1-108-00714-7}} In chapter "20c Linguistic problems of the Balkan area", at page 838, Ronald Arthur Crossland argues "it may be the distinction made by Greeks and Romans between the Getae and Daci, for example, reflected the importance of different sections of a linguistically homogenous people at different times". He furthermore recalls Strabo's testimony and Georgiev's hypothesis for a '[[Daco-Thracian|Thraco-Dacian]]' language.</ref>

[[Pliny the Elder]], in his ''[[Naturalis Historia]]'' (Natural History), ca. 77-79 AD, provides a similar view: "... though various races have occupied the adjacent shores; at one spot the ''Getae'', by the Romans called ''Daci''...".{{sfn|Pliny the Elder|77 AD|loc=IV 25}}

[[Appian]], who began writing his ''[[Roman History (Appian)|Roman History]]'' under [[Antoninus Pius]], Roman Emperor from 138 to 161, noted: <U+201C>[B]ut going beyond these rivers in places they rule some of the [[Celts]] over the [[Rhine]] and the Getae over the [[Danube]], whom they call Dacians<U+201D>.{{sfn|Appian|160 AD|loc=Praef. 1.4}}<ref>{{cite book|ref        = harv|last1      = Millar|first1     = Fergus|last2      = Cotton|first2     = Hannah M.|last3      = Rogers|first3     = Guy M.|title      = Rome, the Greek World, and the East, Volume 2: Government, Society, and Culture in the Roman Empire page 189|year       = 2004|publisher  = University of North Carolina Press|isbn       = 978-0-8078-5520-1}}</ref>

[[Junianus Justinus|Justin]], the 3rd century AD Latin historian, wrote in his ''[[Epitome of Pompeius Trogus]]'' that Dacians are spoken of as descendents of the Getae: ''"Daci quoque suboles Getarum sunt"'' (The Dacians as well are a [[Kinship|scion]] of the Getae).{{sfn|Justin|3rd century AD|loc=XXXII 3}}<ref>{{cite book|ref        = harv |last1      = Papazoglu |first1     = Fanula |title      = The Central Balkan Tribes in Pre-Roman Times:Triballi, Autariatae, Dardanians, Scordisci, & Moesians, translated by Mary Stansfield-Popovic page 335 |year       = 1978 |publisher  = John Benjamins North America |isbn       = 978-90-256-0793-7}}</ref>

In his ''[[Cassius Dio#Roman History|Roman History]]'' (ca. 200 AD), [[Cassius Dio]] adds: "I call the people Dacians, the name used by the natives themselves as well as by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], though I am not ignorant that some Greek writers refer to them as ''Getae'', whether that is the right term or not...".<ref>{{cite book|ref         = harv|last1      =  Shelley|first1      = William Scott |title         =   The Origins of the Europeans: Classical Observations in Culture and Personality, page 108, Cassius Dio (LXVII.4) |year       = 199|publisher  = Intl Scholars Pubns| isbn      =  ISBN 1-57309-220-7, ISBN 978-1-57309-220-3}}</ref>{{sfn | Sidebottom | 2007  |p=6}} He also shows the Dacians to live on both sides of the Lower [[Danube]]; the ones south of the river (today's northern [[Bulgaria]]), in [[Moesia]], and are called [[Moesians]], while the ones north of the river are called Dacians. He argues that the Dacians are "Getae or [[Thracians]] of Dacian race":<ref>Cassius Dio. ''Roman History'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/51*.html#22.7 55.22.6-55.22.7]. "The Suebi, to be exact, dwell beyond the Rhine (though many people elsewhere claim their name), and the Dacians on both sides of the Ister; those of the latter, however, who live on this side of the river near the country of the Triballi are reckoned in with the district of Moesia and are called Moesians, except by those living in the immediate neighbourhood, while those on the other side are called Dacians and are either a branch of the Getae are Thracians belonging to the Dacian race that once inhabited Rhodope."</ref> 
<blockquote>In ancient times, it is true, Moesians and Getae occupied all the land between [[Haemus Mons|Haemus]] and the Ister; but as time went on some of them changed their names, and since then there have been included under the name of Moesia all the tribes living above [[Dalmatia]], [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonia]], and [[Thrace]], and separated from [[Pannonia]] by the [[Savus]], a tributary of the [[Danube|Ister]]. Two of the many tribes found among them are those formerly called the [[Triballi]], and the [[Dardani]], who still retain their old name.<ref>Cassius Dio LI 27</ref></blockquote>

=== Modern interpretations ===
There is a dispute among scholars about the relations between the Getae and [[Dacians]], and this dispute also covers the interpretation of ancient sources. Some historians such as [[Ronald Arthur Crossland]] state that even Ancient Greeks viewed the two designations "interchangeable or with some confusion". Thus, it is generally considered that the two groups were related to a certain degree,<ref name="cah10">{{cite book|title=The Cambridge Ancient History (Volume 10)|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1996|edition=2nd}} J. J. Wilkes mentions "the Getae of the Dobrudja, who were akin to the Dacians" (p. 562)</ref> while the exact relation is a matter of controversy.

Strabo, as well as other ancient sources, led some modern historians to consider that, if the Thracian ethnic group should be divided, one of this divisions should be the "''Daco-Getae''".<ref name="mocsy">{{cite book|author=Andr<U+00E1>s M<U+00F3>csy|title=Pannonia and Upper Moesia|publisher=Routledge and Kegan Paul|year=1974|isbn=0-7100-7714-9}} See p. 364, n. 41: "If there is any justification for dividing the Thracian ethnic group, then, unlike V. Georgiev who suggests splitting it into the Thraco-Getae and the Daco-Mysi, I consider a division into the Thraco-Mysi and the Daco-Getae the more likely."</ref> The [[linguistics|linguist]] [[Ivan Duridanov]] also identified a "[[Dacian linguistic area]]"<ref>{{cite web|author=Duridanov, Ivan|url=http://www.kroraina.com/thrac_lang/thrac_8.html|title=The Thracian, Dacian and Paeonian languages|accessdate=2007-02-11}}</ref> in [[Dacia]], [[Scythia Minor]], [[Lower Moesia]] and [[Upper Moesia]].

[[Romanians|Romanian]] scholars generally went further with the identification, historian [[Constantin C. Giurescu]] claiming the two were identical.<ref>{{cite book|author=Giurescu, Constantin C.|title=Formarea poporului rom<U+00E2>n|location=Craiova|year=1973|language=Romanian|page=23}} "They (Dacians and Getae) are two names for the same people [...] divided in a large number of tribes".

Others who support the identity between Getae and Dacians with ancient sources include freelance writer [[James Minahan]] and [[Catherine B Avery]], who claim the people whom the Greek called ''Getae'' were called ''Daci'' by the Romans.{{sfn| Minahan J| Minahan JB|2000 |p=549}} {{sfn| Avery |1962 |p=497}} The same view is expressed by some British historians such as [[Sandler Berkowitz David]] and [[Philip Matyszak]].{{sfn| Sandler Berkowitz| Morison |1984 |p=160}}{{sfn| Matyszak| 2009|p=215}}  The Bulgarian historian and thracologist [[Alexander Fol]] considers that the Getae became known as "Dacians" in Greek and Latin in the writings of [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]], Strabo and [[Pliny the Elder]], as Roman observers adopted the name of the [[Dacian tribe]] to refer to all the unconquered inhabitants north of the [[Danube]].{{sfn| Fol |1996 |p=223}}   Also, [[Sir Edward Bunbury, 9th Baronet|Edward Bunbury]] believed the name of Getae, by which they were originally known to the Greeks on the [[Euxine]], was always retained by the latter in common usage: while that of Dacians, whatever be its origin, was that by which the more western tribes, adjoining the [[Pannonians]], first became known to the Romans.{{sfn|Bunbury|1979|p=151}} Some scholars consider the Getae and Dacians to be the same people at different stages of their history and discuss their culture as ''Geto-Dacian''.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=335}}

==== Same language, distinct people ====
Historian and archaeologist [[Alexandru Vulpe]] found a remarkable uniformity of the Geto-Dacian culture,<ref>{{cite book|editor=Petrescu-D<U+00EE>mbovi<U+0163>a, Mircea; Vulpe, Alexandru (eds)|title=Istoria Rom<U+00E2>nilor, vol.

Ronald Arthur Crossland suggested the two designations may refer to two groups of a "linguistically homogeneous people" that had come to historical prominence at two distinct periods of time. He also compared the probable linguistic situation with the relation between modern [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] and [[Danish language|Danish]] languages.<ref name="cah3"/> [[Paul Lachlan MacKendrick]] considered the two as "branches" of the same tribe, speaking two dialects of a common language.<ref name="mackendrick">{{cite book|title=The Dacian Stones Speak|author=Paul Lachlan MacKendrick|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|year=1975|isbn=0-8078-4939-1}} "The natives with whom we shall be concerned in this chapter are the Getae of Muntenia and Moldavia in the eastern steppes, and the Dacians of the Carpathian Mountains. Herodotus calls them 'the bravest and the justest of the Thracians,' and they were in fact two branches of the same tribe, speaking two dialects of the same Indo-European language." (p. 45)</ref>

The Romanian [[History of ideas|historian of ideas]] and [[Historiography|historiographer]] [[Lucian Boia]] stated: "At a certain point, the phrase Geto-Dacian was coined in the Romanian historiography to suggest a unity of Getae and Dacians".<ref name="boia">{{cite book|author=Boia, Lucian|title=Romania: Borderland of Europe|publisher=Reaktion Books|year=2004|isbn=1-86189-103-2|page=43}}</ref> Lucian Boia took a sceptical position, arguing the ancient writers distinguished among the two people, treating them as two distinct groups of the Thracian ethnos.<ref name="boia"/><ref name="boiamyth">{{cite book|author=Boia, Lucian|title=History and Myth in Romanian Consciousness|publisher=Central European University Press|year=2001|isbn=963-9116-97-1|page=14}}</ref> Boia contended that it would be naive to assume Strabo knew the [[Thracian]] dialects so well,<ref name="boia"/> alleging that Strabo had "no competence in the field of Thracian dialects".<ref name="boiamyth"/> The latter claim is contested, some studies attesting Strabo's reliability and sources.<ref name="homoglottoi">{{cite journal|author=Janakieva, Svetlana|title=La notion de <U+039F><U+039C><U+039F><U+0393><U+039B><U+03A9><U+03A4><U+03A4><U+039F><U+0399> chez Strabon et la situation ethno-linguistique sur les territoires thraces|language=French|journal=<U+00C9>tudes Balkaniques|pages=75<U+2013>79|issue=4|year=2002}} The author concluded Strabo's claim sums an experience following of many centuries of neighbourhood and cultural interferences between the Greeks and the Thracian tribes</ref> There is no reason to disregard Strabo's view that the Daci and the Getae spoke the same language.<ref name="price"/> Boia also stressed that some Romanian authors cited Strabo indiscriminately.<ref name="boiamyth"/>

A similar position was adopted by Romanian historian and archaeologist [[G. A.

Kossinna<U+2019>s concepts of culture, archaeology and ethnicity".</ref> In his opinion, Alexandru Vulpe saw ancient people as modern nations, leading the latter to interpret the common language as a sign of a common people, despite Strabo making a distinction between the two.<ref name="AGN2"/>

== History ==
[[Image:Getae 200bc.jpg|thumb|300px|Eastern Europe in 200 BC showing the Getae tribes north of the Danube river.]]

=== 7th century BC ===
From the 7th century BC onwards, the Getae came into economic and cultural contact with the Greeks, who were establishing [[Colonies in antiquity|colonies]] on the western side of Pontus Euxinus, nowadays the Black Sea. The Getae are mentioned for the first time together in [[Herodotus]] in his narrative of the Scythian campaign of [[Darius I]] in 513 BC. According to Herodotus, the Getae differed from other Thracian tribes in their religion, centered around the god (''daimon'') [[Zalmoxis]] whom some of the Getae called [[Gebeleizis]].<ref>Herodotus. ''Histories'', 4.93-4.97.</ref>

Between the 5th and 3rd centuries BC, the Getae were mostly under the rule of the flourishing [[Odrysian kingdom]]. During this time, the Getae provided military services and became famous for their cavalry. After the disintegration of the Odrysian kingdom, smaller Getic principalities began to consolidate themselves.

=== Persian expedition ===
Before setting out on his [[Persian Empire|Persian]] expedition, [[Alexander the Great]] defeated the Getae and razed one of their settlements.<ref>[http://websfor.org/alexander/arrian/book1a.asp Arrian. ''Anabasis'', Book IA]. "The Getae did not sustain even the first charge of the cavalry; for Alexander<U+2019>s audacity seemed incredible to them, in having thus easily crossed the Ister, the largest of rivers, in a single night, without throwing a bridge over the stream. Terrible to them also was the closely locked order of the phalanx, and violent the charge of the cavalry. At first they fled for refuge into their city, which. was distant about a parasang from the Ister; but when they saw that Alexander was leading his phalanx carefully along the side of the river, to prevent his infantry being anywhere surrounded by the Getae lying in ambush, but that he was sending his cavalry straight on, they again abandoned the city, because it was badly fortified."</ref> In 313 BC, the Getae formed an alliance with [[Callatis]], [[Varna|Odessos]], and other western Pontic Greek colonies against [[Lysimachus]], who held a fortress at Tirizis (modern [[Kaliakra]]).<ref>Strabo. ''Geography'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/7F*.html 7.6.1]. "On this coast-line is Cape Tirizis, a stronghold, which Lysimachus once used as a treasury."</ref>

The Getae flourished especially in the first half of the 3rd century BC. By about 200 BC, the authority of the Getic prince, [[Zalmodegicus]], stretched as far as [[Histria (ancient city)|Histria]], as a contemporary inscription shows.<ref>Supplementum Epigraphicum Graecum 18.288</ref> Other strong princes included [[Zoltes]] and [[Rhemaxos]] (about 180 BC). Also, several Getic rulers minted their own coins. The ancient authors [[Strabo]]<ref>Strabo. ''Geography'', 16.2.38-16.2.39.</ref> and [[Cassius Dio]]<ref>Cassius Dio. ''Roman History'', 68.9.</ref> say that Getae practiced [[ruler cult]], and this is confirmed by archaeological remains.

=== Conflict with Rome ===
In 72-71 BC, [[Marcus Terentius Varro Lucullus]] became the first [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] commander to march against the Getae. This was done to strike at the western Pontic allies of [[Mithridates VI]], but he had limited success. A decade later, a coalition of [[Scythians]], Getae, [[Bastarnae]] and Greek colonists defeated C. [[Antonius Hybrida]] at [[Histria (Sinoe)|Histria]].<ref>[[Livy]]. ''[[Ab Urbe Condita]]'', 103.</ref><ref>Cassius Dio. ''Roman History'', 38.10.1-38.10.3.</ref> This victory over the Romans allowed [[Burebista]], the leader of this coalition, to dominate the region for a short period (60-50 BC).

In the mid-first BCE [[Burebista]] organized a [[Dacia|kingdom]] consisting of descendants of those whom the Greeks had called ''Getae'', as well as [[Dacians]], or ''Daci'', the name applied to people of the region by the Romans.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=335}}

[[Augustus]] aimed at subjugating the entire [[Balkan peninsula]], and used an incursion of the Bastarnae across the Danube as a pretext to devastate the Getae and Thracians. He put [[Marcus Licinius Crassus (consul 30 BC)|Marcus Licinius Crassus]] in charge of the plan. In 29 BC, Crassus defeated the Bastarnae with the help of the Getic prince [[Rholes]].<ref>Cassius Dio. ''Roman History'', 52.24.7; 26.1.</ref> Crassus promised him help for his support against the Getic ruler [[Dapyx]].<ref>Cassius Dio. ''Roman History'', 51.26.</ref> After Crassus had reached as far the [[Danube Delta]], Rholes was appointed king and returned to Rome. In 16 BC, the [[Sarmatae]] invaded the Getic territory and were driven back by Roman troops.<ref>Cassius Dio. ''Roman History'', 54.20.1-54.20.3.</ref> The Getae were placed under the control of the Roman vassal king in Thrace, [[Rhoemetalces I]]. In 6 AD, the province of [[Moesia]] was founded, incorporating the Getae south of the [[Danube River]]. The Getae north of the Danube continued tribal autonomy outside the Roman Empire.

[[Image:Sveshtari Thracian tomb Bulgaria IFB.JPG|right|thumb|250px|The [[Thracian Tomb of Sveshtari]], [[Bulgaria]].]]

According to [[Herodotus]], the Getae were "the noblest as well as the most [[justice|just]] of all the Thracian tribes."<ref name="Herodotus. Histories, 4.93">Herodotus. ''Histories'', 4.93.</ref> When the [[Persian Empire|Persian]]s, led by [[Darius I of Persia|Darius the Great]], campaigned against the [[Scythia]]ns, the Thracian tribes in the [[Balkans]] [[Surrender (military)|surrendered]] to Darius on his way to [[Scythia]], and only the Getae offered resistance.<ref name="Herodotus. Histories, 4.93"/>

One episode from the history of the Getae is attested by several ancient writers.<ref>Strabo. ''Geography'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/7C*.html#3.8 3.8].</ref><ref>Pausanias.

When [[Lysimachus]] tried to subdue the Getae he was defeated by them. The Getae king, [[Dromichaetes]], took him prisoner but he treated him well and convinced Lysimachus there is more to gain as an ally than as an enemy of the Getae and released him. According to Diodorus, Dromichaetes entertained Lysimachus at his palace at Helis, where food was served on gold and silver plates. The discovery of the celebrated tomb at [[Sveshtari]] (1982) suggests that Helis was located perhaps in its vicinity,<ref>{{cite journal|author=Delev, P.|title=Lysimachus, the Getae, and Archaeology (2000)|journal=The Classical Quarterly, New Series|pages=384<U+2013>401|issue=Vol. 50, No. 2|year=2000|doi=10.1093/cq/50.2.384|volume=50}}</ref> where remains of a large antique city are found along with dozens of other Thracian mound tombs.

As stated earlier, the principal god of the Getae was [[Zalmoxis]] whom they sometimes called [[Gebeleizis]].

:''"This same people, when it [[lightning|lightens]] and [[thunder]]s, aim their [[arrow]]s at the [[sky]], uttering threats against the god; and they do not believe that there is any god but their own."'' - Herodotus. ''Histories'', 4.94.

[[Pliny the Elder]] in his ''[[Naturalis Historia]]'' mentions a tribe called the [[Tyragetae]],<ref>Pliny the Elder. ''Naturalis Historia'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plin.+Nat.+4.26 4.26]. "Leaving Taphr<U+00E6>, and going along the mainland, we find in the interior the Auchet<U+00E6>, in whose country the Hypanis has its rise, as also the Neur<U+0153>, in whose district the Borysthenes has its source, the Geloni, the Thyssaget<U+00E6>, the Budini, the Basilid<U+00E6>, and the Agathyrsi with their azure-coloured hair."</ref> apparently a Daco-Thracian tribe who dwelt by the river Tyras (the [[Dniester]]). Their [[ethnonym|tribal name]] appears to be a combination of ''Tyras'' and ''Getae''; cf. the names [[Thyssagetae]] and [[Massagetae]].

The Roman poet [[Ovid]], during his long exile in [[Constan<U+0163>a#History|Tomis]], is asserted to have written poetry (now lost) in the [[Getic language]]. In his ''[[Epistulae ex Ponto]]'', written from the northern coast of the Black Sea, he asserts that two major, distinct languages were spoken by the sundry tribes of Scythia, which he referred to as Getic, and Sarmatian.

== Physical appearance ==

[[Jerome]] (Letter CVII to Laeta. II) described the Getae as red and yellow-haired.<ref>http://orthodoxchurchfathers.com/fathers/npnf206/npnf2062.htm</ref>

== Getae and Goths ==
The [[Goths]], a [[Germanic people]], with their ''[[urheimat]]'' in [[G<U+00F6>taland]] (Scandinavia) are usually equated with the Getae by Roman authors during the middle of the mid-to-late [[1st millennium]].

At the close of the 4th century AD, [[Claudian]], court poet to the emperor [[Flavius Augustus Honorius|Honorius]] and the [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] [[Stilicho]], uses the ethnonym ''Getae'' to refer  to the [[Visigoths]].

During 5th and 6th centuries, several historians and ethnographers ([[Marcellinus Comes]], [[Paulus Orosius|Orosius]], [[John Lydus]], [[Isidore of Seville]], [[Procopius of Caesarea]]) used the same ethnonym ''Getae'' to name populations invading the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] ([[Goths]], [[Gepids]], [[Kutrigurs]], [[Slavs]]). For instance, in the third book of the [[s:History of the Wars/Book III|History of the Wars]] [[Procopius]] details: "There were many Gothic nations in earlier times, just as also at the present, but the greatest and most important of all are the Goths, Vandals, Visigoths, and Gepaedes. In ancient times, however, they were named Sauromatae and Melanchlaeni; and there were some too who called these nations Getic."<ref>[[s:History of the Wars/Book III#II|Procopius. ''History of the Wars'', Book III (Wikisource)]].</ref>

The Getae were also assumed to be the ancestors of the Goths by [[Jordanes]] in his ''[[The Origin and Deeds of the Goths|Getica]]'' written at the middle of the 6th century. Jordanes assumed the earlier testimony of Orosius.
