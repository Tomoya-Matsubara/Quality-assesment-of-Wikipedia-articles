'''Scavenger''' is the name of several [[fictional characters]] in the [[Transformers]] universes. Scavenger is usually depicted as a [[villain]] who turns into a construction vehicle.

Scavenger is an unashamedly pathetic Decepticon. Desperate to prove his worth to his team-mates, he uses his one true gift - his shovel's ability to detect various magnetic, ionic, electrical or gas readings - to locate items of value, although invariably, all he can usually find is junk. He transforms into an [[excavator]], and the right arm of Devastator.

A recolor of the Scavenger toy was sold in Europe which didn't have a given name and didn't combine with his fellow Constructicons.

===Marvel Comics===
The origins of the Constructicons in [[Marvel Comics]]' ''Transformers'' series was not nearly so complicated. Seeking to bolster the size of his forces on Earth in 1985, Decepticon Commander [[Shockwave (Transformers)|Shockwave]] arranged for the construction of six new Decepticon bodies, which were then infused with life by the power of the [[Autobot Matrix of Leadership|Creation Matrix]], tapped from the head of the imprisoned [[Optimus Prime]]. Thus, the Constructicons were born, and were immediately put to work building a massive radio transmission dish that [[Soundwave (Transformers)|Soundwave]] used to beam a message to Cybertron. When the Autobots attempted to interfere, the Constructicons revealed their hidden power and merged into Devastator to fight them off, allowing the message to successfully go through.

Scavenger made an appearance in the Decepticon forces under the command of Megatron in issue #7 of the Marvel ''Generation 2'' comic series, in a story called "New Dawn." Megatron lead his Decepticons against [[Jhiaxus]]' second generation Cybertronians near the moon of Tykos. The Decepticons were defeated and Megatron left injured, presumed dead, but swearing revenge.<ref>http://www.seibertron.com/comics/view.php?comic_id=113</ref>

===Animated series===
Scavenger first appeared in the season 1 episode "Heavy Metal War". Originally to be named '''Scrounge''', Scavenger was erroneously referred to by this name once in the Constructicons' debut animated series episode. He appears in ''[[The Transformers: The Movie]]''. He was with the Decepticons when they ambushed the Autobot shuttle. He kills Prowl with a single blast from his gun.

===Books===
Scavenger appeared in the 1986 [[Ballantine Books]] story ''[[The Invisibility Factor]]'' by [[Josepha Sherman]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Sherman|first=Josepha|isbn=0-345-33391-8|title=The Invisibility Factor|publisher=Ballantine Books|year=1986}}</ref>

===Dreamwave Productions===
When civil war broke out on the planet Cybertron between the Autobots and Decepticons, Scavenger joined up with the Decepticons under [[Megatron (Transformers)|Megatron]].

Scavenger and the Constructions were successful in designing the first combiner, when they designed a united form for themselves called Devastator.

When Megatron and Autobot leader Optimus Prime disappeared in an accident with a space bridge, the Autobot and Decepticon forces splintered into smaller factions. The Constructicons joined up with the [[Ultracons]] under the leadership of [[Ratbat]].

When the Constructicons came with Earth they were reformatted into Earth-like construction vehicles.

===Fun Publications===
The ''[[Transformers Classics]]'' comics published in the Official Transformers Collectors Club magazine is set in the Marvel Comics continuity, but in a timeline where the events of ''Generation 2'' did not occur. The story occurs fifteen years after Megatron was presumed dead in the crash of the Ark. Megatron survived, and eventually upgraded his body (based on his Classics toy) and gathered many other Decepticons to him. Soundwave helped him in recovering the body of Astrotrain, who was then used to help locate the placement of other fallen Decepticons around the globe. Those who joined Megatron included Laserbeak, [[Ramjet (Transformers)|Ramjet]], Ravage, [[Skywarp]], [[Soundwave (Transformers)|Soundwave]], [[Starscream (Transformers)|Starscream]] and the [[Constructicons]]). Megatron also reactivated Thrust, Dirge and Thundercracker, but the three left him to join up with Bludgeon's troops - mostly because they couldn't work with Starscream, who had killed them once. Megatron's based his command from the wreck of the Ark in the Yukon, where he keeps the fallen body of Ratchet as a trophy and the severed, but living, head of Shockwave as an advisor.

In the ''[[Transformers: Timelines]]'' story "[[Games of Deception]]" by [[Fun Publications]] Scavenger appears among Megatrons troops.

The name Scavenger reappeared in ''[[Beast Wars]]'' as a [[Predacon (Transformers)|Predacon]] [[Transmetals|transmetal]] ant that was able to turn into a drilling vehicle.

He was meant to be a transmetal upgrade version of [[Inferno (Transformers)|Inferno]], as is obvious from his tech specs, but was renamed in the U.S.

His bio indicates that his transmetal body now provides him with drill arms he uses to travel underground and ambush unwary Maximals from below.

===Animated series===
Scavenger(as Inferno)'s stasis pod was presumably among those who were launched into orbit around prehistoric Earth in the ''Beast Wars'' series pilot.

===IDW Publishing===
Scavenger (as a separate character from Inferno) eventually appeared in the [[IDW Publishing]] ''Beast Wars'' comics as a protoform turned into a Predacon by [[Magmatron]]. He was sent to dispose of Razorbeast and his small band, but the attack was interrupted by a much larger force of Maximals. During the battle, Scavenger got his teeth re-organized, courtesy of Bonecrusher's fist. After the battle, if he survived, he presumably regrouped with Ravage and the rest of the Predacons.

He appears among the Predacons on the cover of the first issue of the sequel story ''Beast Wars: The Ascending''.

Scavenger had a biography printed in the ''Beast Wars Sourcebook'' by [[IDW Publishing]].<ref>http://www.monstersandcritics.com/books/comics/news/article_1343405.php/Creators_of_Transformers_Beast_Wars_The_Gathering_are_back</ref>

Scavenger was a Basic-sized [[Vehicon]] which transformed into a Cybertronian Demolitions Vehicle.  He did not appear in the TV series, nor is he related to any previous Transformer with the name Scavenger.  Scavenger-style drones appeared among the Vehicons in the ''Transformer: Universe:'' Wreckers comic.<ref>http://www.bwtf.com/bm/toys/reviews/scavenger/</ref>

Counted among the tank-type Vehicons, Scavenger is a powerhouse, crushing his enemies with brute force and very little subtlety - and he loves it. Commanded by [[Tankor]] and armed with deadly electricity claws, Scavenger loves little more than what he was created for: pure destruction.

===3H Enterprises===
The Scavenger drones would appear in the ''[[Transformers: Universe]]-Wreckers'' storyline under the command of [[Quake (Transformers)|Quake]] and [[Blastcharge]], who had been ordered by [[Megatron (Beast Wars and Beast Machines)|Megatron]] to hunt down the [[Wreckers (Transformers)|Wreckers]]. In the subsequent battle, most of the drones were destroyed by the Wreckers.

Being a Hasbro only release, he did not appear in the ''[[Transformers: Robots in Disguise]]'' anime series. This toy did not receive any official bio from Hasbro either, so it is unknown who he is and what his personality is like.

The second Autobot to bear the name Scavenger, he is painted as a homage to the Generation 1 Constructicons, and is called Devastar in Japan, the Japanese name of [[Constructicons|Devastator]].  His Decepticon appearance and name relates to his undercover work.<ref>http://www.bwtf.com/armada/toys/reviews/scavenger/</ref>

===Armada series===
Scavenger made his first appearance in the show as a bounty hunter. One could suppose that his enormous strength and exceptional fighting skill were already well-known to all the Transformers because [[Megatron (Unicron Trilogy)|Megatron]] himself requested his services and promised to reward him handsomely if he assisted him to obtain the [[Star Saber]] (much to the other Decepticons' displeasure).  Scavenger helped Megatron to gather the [[Skyboom Shield]] up. Also he confronted [[Hot Shot (Transformers)|Hot Shot]] in the several battles and defeated him easily, though the young warrior wielded the Star Saber. It seemed that Scavenger was a dangerous rogue who was in alliance with the Decepticons, but this was called into question when he later saved Hot Shot from being destroyed by the Decepticons when the latter has been abandoned by [[Sideways]] on the Moon.  The truth was finally revealed, and it turned out that Scavenger was, in fact, actually an Autobot spying on the Decepticons. However, not all the 'Bots were friendly disposed towards him, and some of them, like [[Smokescreen (Transformers)|Smokescreen]], considered him being a traitor. But soon those who mistrusted Scavenger had to acknowledge themselves wrong when he saved [[Optimus Prime (Unicron Trilogy)|Optimus Prime]]'s life during just another battle with the Decepticons.

The main features of Scavenger's character were his self-possession and independency. When being among the 'Cons, he allowed himself to have the sly digs at Megatron himself, and the Decepticons' leader preferred to pay no attention to this. Later, when joining the 'Bots, he was the first who dared to take part of [[Starscream (Transformers)|Starscream]] when the latter arrived to the A-Base after his breaking with the Decepticons. Indeed, Scavenger always did and said everything he considered his duty to do or to say, and he never took much care of what the others would think about him.
Also Scavenger was known for his harsh personality, which was contrasted by his tendency to sleep when off-duty.  He trained the Armada incarnation of Optimus Prime as well as [[Blurr]] and (over the course of the series), Hot Shot who, in his turn, conveyed his lessons to his own trainee [[Sideswipe (Transformers)|Sideswipe]].

===Dreamwave Productions===
Scavenger would also appear in the [[Dreamwave Productions]]' [[Transformers: Armada (comics)|comic]] version of Armada. An Autobot from the very beginning, Scavenger was unable to stop the Decepticons from using the Mini-Cons to take over Cyber City. Later, when the Mini-Con distress beacon was activated, Scavenger accompanied Prime to Earth, battling [[Cyclonus]] and [[Starscream (Unicron Trilogy)|Starscream]]. He took part in many of the adventures on Earth, but nearly met his end after a full-scale Decepticon attack on the Autobot base in the wake of Optimus Prime's disappearance. With [[Smokescreen (Transformers)|Smokescreen]] nearly killed by [[Megatron (Unicron Trilogy)|Megatron]], Scavenger, along with [[Hot Shot (Transformers)|Hot Shot]] and [[Red Alert (Transformers)|Red Alert]] attacked the Decepticon leader as he attempted to make a deal with Unicron, seemingly knocking him into Unicron's mouth and killing him.

Armada Scavenger continued to appear among the Autobots in the Transformers: Energon comic series by Dreamwave. His main appearance was in Issue #27 of the ''Energon'' Comic where he was one of the Autobots who volunteered to head to Earth to help battle the Terrorcon invasion.

===Fun Publications===
Scavenger appeared in the text story from [[Fun Publications]] called "Force of Habit." This story explained where he was during the events of the ''Cybertron'' story. [[Ultra Magnus]] was the commander of various Autobot ships sent to other planets in search for the Cyber Planet Keys. Scavenger served as captain of the [[Die Cast (Transformers)|Die Cast]] which was sent to [[Zeta Persei]].

There are two ''Transformers: Universe'' toys called Scavenger.  Neither of them have appeared in any official ''Transformers: Universe'' storyline. They appear similar to ''Generation One'' Scavenger, but without biographies or storyline they may or may not be the original Scavenger.

Transtech Scavenger was among the concept characters for the proposed Transtech TV series.

After the [[Beast Machines]] line ended, [[Hasbro]] planned a follow-up series called [[Transtech]]. The Transtech concept was a line intended to take Transformers to their most futuristic. Hasbro commissioned sets of designs from [[Draxhall Jump]]. The series was supposedly to bring back some of the characters who died in ''[[Beast Wars]]'' along with some Generation 1 characters, all in new, more [[Organic life|organic]]-looking bodies, though with vehicle alternate modes instead of the animals used in ''Beast Machines''. Many concept sketches and even a few toy prototypes were made, but Hasbro scrapped the idea in favor of bringing ''[[Transformers: Robots in Disguise|Car Robots]]'' to their markets as [[Transformers: Robots in Disguise]].

In the biography printed for Transtech [[Blackarachnia]] it is mentioned that he and [[Immorticon]] are Predacons from the same world what Blackarachnia, a Maximal, is from. They became stranded on Transtech Cybertron and joined up with [[Alpha Trion]].

===Fun Publications===
Transtech Scavenger appeared among the troops of [[Alpha Trion]] in the story ''Transcendent'' by [[Fun Publications]]. He aided in the raid on [[Shockwave (Transformers)|Shockwave]]'s lab to free [[Breakaway (Transformers)|Breakaway]]. The group then escaped through a dimensional portal to the ''Shattered Glass'' Cybertron.<ref>{{Cite journal | author = Forest Lee| title = Transcendent Part 5| journal = Transformers Collectors Club Magazine| volume = 1 | issue = 23 | pages= 10<U+2013>15 |date = October/November 2008 |url=http://transformersclub.com/_images/TFmag15.pdf}}</ref>

Scavenger appears in the 2009 film ''[[Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen]]'' as one of the models of Constructicon, having the same alternate mode as [[Demolishor]], though his robot mode isn't seen in the movie.<ref>http://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2009-04-01-transformers-first-look_N.htm First look: Robo-brawlers big, small in new 'Transformers' By Anthony Breznican, USA TODAY</ref> Demolishor has more white in his color, while Scavenger is more red, but with all Demolishor's scenes occurring in the dark it is hard to tell in the film. Additionally most Demolishor toys were released in Scavenger's red deco.

Scavenger forms the torso of [[Devastator (Transformers)|Devastator]], along with [[Overload (Transformers)|Overload]].

Scavenger stands about 86 feet tall to the top of his wheel.<ref>http://www.tfw2005.com/transformers-news/transformers-movie-just-movie-31/revenge-of-the-fallen-constructicons-size-comparison-168152/</ref>

=== Movie plot ===
Scavenger is the largest Constructicon. Scavenger was seen transforming with the other Constructicons to form Devastator. He was presumably destroyed when Devastator was ripped apart by a rail gun.

===Games ===
Scavenger is not a playable character in the video game but his combined form as Devastator's torso is seen. He is killed when the player defeats Devastator.

This Scavenger is an alternate good version of the ''Generation 1'' character from the "Shattered Glass" storyline, in which the Decepticons are on the side of good and the Autobots on the side of evil. Presumably like all Decepticons of his world, he is heroic and opposed to the evil Autobots.

===Fun Publications===
Scavenger appears in ''Reunification'' by [[Fun Publications]] where he helps repair damage [[Galvatron]] received in battle with Omega Doom.

===Toys===
Although no toy has been made for this version of Scavenger he seems to be based on the ''Generation 1'' toy, but colored as a homage to the ''Generation 1'' Protectobots, in white with red highlights.
{{-}}

==Transformers: Prime==
Scavenger is a homage to the ''Revenge of the Fallen'' character of the same name.

===Books===
Scavenger appears as one of the Constructicons that combine to form Devastator in the novel ''[[Transformers: Exodus]]''.
