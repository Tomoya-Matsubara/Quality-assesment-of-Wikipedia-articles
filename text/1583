'''Saint-Georges''' is a [[metro station|station]] on [[Paris M<U+00E9>tro Line 12|Line 12]] of the [[Paris M<U+00E9>tro]] in the [[18th arrondissement of Paris|18th arrondissement]]. 

The station opened on 31 October 1912 as part of the extension of the [[Nord-Sud company]]'s line A from [[Notre-Dame-de-Lorette (Paris M<U+00E9>tro)|Notre-Dame-de-Lorette]] to [[Pigalle (Paris M<U+00E9>tro)|Pigalle]]. On 27 March 1931 line A became line 12 of the ''M<U+00E9>tro''. The station is named after the ''Rue Saint-Georges'', which became a street in 1734 and leads to the ''Place Saint-Georges'', created in 1824.  It was the centre of an estate created by the speculator Dosne, father-in-law of the politician [[Adolphe Thiers]]. 

It was renovated during the early 2000s in imitation of the style adopted by the ''Nord-Sud Company'', the original architects of the station. In fact, the current decorative style only vaguely resembles the original: the station name is no longer shown on large ceramic tablets (as at [[Solf<U+00E9>rino (Paris M<U+00E9>tro)|Solf<U+00E9>rino]] and [[Abbesses (Paris M<U+00E9>tro)|Abbesses]]) and does not follow the original colour coding: the edge of the ceramic name tablets should be brown to designate a non-interchange station, rather than green.
