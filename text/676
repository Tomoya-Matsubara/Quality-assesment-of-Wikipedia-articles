'''''Another Green World''''' is the third studio album by British musician [[Brian Eno]]. Produced by Eno and [[Rhett Davies]], it was originally released by [[Island Records]] in September 1975. As he had done with previous solo albums, Eno worked with several guest musicians including [[Phil Collins]], [[John Cale]] and [[Robert Fripp]]. The album marked a great musical change from Eno's previous albums. Using his instruction cards the [[Oblique Strategies]] for guidance, the album contained fewer lyric-based rock songs and had stronger emphasis on instrumental productions; many without the aid of guest musicians. The dark humor of the lyrics also changed to more dreamlike and addled songs.

The album failed to chart in the United States or the United Kingdom. ''Another Green World'' met with both high praise from several critics, but also with negative reviews that felt the album was too great of a departure from Eno's previous more [[rock music|rock]]-based material. Modern reception of ''Another Green World'' has been generally positive; several critics and publications often place the album on lists of the top albums of all time.

==Production==
''Another Green World'' was recorded at [[Island Studios]] in London during the months of July and August 1975.<ref name="Tamm102">Tamm, 1995. p.102</ref> Brian Eno originally viewed his new album as an experiment and entered the recording studio
with nothing written or prepared beforehand.<ref name="Tamm102" /> For the first four days in the studio, Eno failed to be productive.<ref name="Howard195">Howard, 2004. p.195</ref> To look for new ideas, Eno turned to his instructional cards, the [[Oblique Strategies]], and began coming up with new ideas as he did with his previous album ''[[Taking Tiger Mountain (By Strategy)]]''.<ref name="Howard195" />

Some of the album credits for the instruments have fanciful names that describe the sound they make. The  "Castanet Guitars" are [[electric guitars]] played with [[mallets]] and are electronically treated to sound something like [[castanets]].<ref name="Tamm102" /> The "Leslie piano" is an [[acoustic piano]] miked and fed through a [[Leslie speaker]] with a built-in revolving horn speaker.<ref name="Tamm102" /> Eno described the "snake guitar" and "digital guitar" by stating "the kind of lines I was playing reminded me of the way a [[snake]] moves through the brush, a sort of speedy, forceful, liquid quality. Digital guitar is a guitar threaded through a digital delay but fed back on itself a lot so it makes this cardboard tube type of sound."<ref name="Tamm102" />

Like his previous two solo efforts, Eno had several guest musicians contributing to ''Another Green World''. Unlike his previous albums, Eno worked on more solo material with seven songs on the album have Eno playing all the instruments himself, including electronic and nonelectronic keyboards, guitars, and percussion.<ref name="Tamm101" /> Among the guest musicians was [[Phil Collins]], who played drums on ''Tiger Mountain'' and got along with Eno, which led to calling him and fellow  [[Brand X]] bandmate [[Percy Jones (musician)|Percy Jones]] to play on ''Another Green World''.<ref name="Hudson58">Holm-Hudson, 2008. p.58</ref> On recording the album, Collins recalled  <blockquote>"[Eno] gave us all a bit of paper, and we made lists from one to 15. Eno said 'No. 2, we all play a G; No. 7 we all play a C sharp'; an so on. So it was like painting by numbers...[Eno] used to love me and Percy; we'd go in and run through our dictionary licks and he'd record them and make a loop of them."<ref name="Thompson117">Thompson, 1995. p.117<U+2013>118</ref></blockquote> [[Robert Fripp]], who worked with Eno on ''[[(No Pussyfooting)]]'' and ''Here Come the Warm Jets'', performed the solo on "St. Elmo's Fire". Eno asked Fripp to improvise a lightning-fast guitar solo that would imitate an electrical charge between two poles on a [[Wimshurst machine|Wimshurst high voltage generator]].<ref name="Jones117">Jones, 1995. p.188</ref>

==Music and lyrics==
''Another Green World'' represents a turning point in Brian Eno's musical career. While his previous albums contained quirky rock songs, on ''Another Green World'' only five of the fourteen tracks have lyrics.<ref name="Tamm101">Tamm, 1995. p.101</ref> The instrumental tracks explore a new kind of sound that is more quiet and restful, marking the change between Eno's earlier rock songs and his later instrumental works in which texture and timbre are the most important musical elements.<ref name="Tamm101" /> "Sky Saw" opens the album with the instruments constantly changing structure, except for one of the two bass parts which plays the same pattern throughout.<ref name="Tamm118">Tamm, 1995. p.118</ref> Eno has re-used differently mixed instrumentations of "Sky Saw" for a track for ''[[Music for Films]]'' and a song for [[Ultravox]]'s [[Ultravox! (album)|debut album]] which he would later produce.<ref name="Tamm119">Tamm, 1995. p.119</ref> "Over Fire Island" has a [[jazz music|jazz]] influence on the bass and drumming style.<ref name="pitchfork">{{cite web

}}</ref><ref name="Tamm121">Tamm, 1995. p.121</ref> "In Dark Trees" and "The Big Ship" are two songs which Eno plays all the instruments, namely the synthesizer, synthetic percussion and treated rhythm generator. The pulse of these songs is provided by the repeated rhythm coming from the rhythm box.<ref name="Tamm122">Tamm, 1995. p.122</ref> These instrumental pieces and others like "Little Fishes" have been described as "highly imagistic, like paintings done in sound that actually resemble their titles".<ref name="allmusicreview" />

To create the lyrics, Eno would later play the backing tracks singing nonsense syllables to himself, then taking them and forming them into actual words, phrases and meaning.<ref name="Tamm99">Tamm, 1995. p.99</ref> This lyric-writing method was used for all his more vocal-based recordings of the 1970s.<ref name="Tamm81">Tamm, 1995. p.81</ref>
In the tracks that do feature lyrics, they are in the same free-associative style as Eno's previous albums.<ref name="Tamm101" /><ref name="allmusicreview"/> The humour in the lyrics has been described as "less bizarre than gently whimsical and addled".<ref name="allmusicreview"/>

Henry Edwards of ''[[High Fidelity (magazine)|High Fidelity]]'' wrote positively of the album, claiming it to be Eno's "most accessible to date".<ref name="Tamm103">Tamm, 1995. p.103</ref> Tom Hill of ''[[The Village Voice]]'' also noted the accessibility of the album, stating "It wouldn't be fair to say that ''Another Green World'' is Eno's best album, but certainly it is his easiest to love." Charley Walters of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' praised the album, claiming "Eno insists on risks, and that they so consistently pan out is a major triumph.

It doesn't even get on my nerves."<ref name="Tamm105">Tamm, 1995. p.105</ref> [[Lester Bangs]] of ''The Village Voice'' shared this view, noting "I found much of it a bit too, well, "Becalmed", as one of its precisely programmatic titles declared. Those little pools of sound on the outskirts
of silence seemed to me the logical consequence of letting the processes and technology share your conceptual burden".<ref name="Tamm105" /> [[Robert Christgau]] suggested the same at first, but wrote in his review "Although I resisted at first, I've grown to love every minute of this arty little collection of static (i.e., non-swinging) synthesizer pieces (with vocals, percussion, and guitar)."<ref name="Christgau">{{cite web
