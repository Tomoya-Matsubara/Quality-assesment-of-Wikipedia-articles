'''Roadblock''' is a fictional character from the [[G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero]] toyline, comic books and cartoon series. He is the G.I. Joe Team's Heavy Machine Gunner and debuted in 1984.

==Profile==
Roadblock's real name is Marvin F. Hinton and he was born in [[Biloxi, Mississippi]]. His primary function in G.I. Joe is as a heavy machine gunner and his secondary function is as a [[cook (profession)|cook]]. 

Roadblock grew up with a large extended family, but was shy despite being a Boy Scout and singing in the church choir.<ref name="Hidalgo 2009 21">{{cite book |title= G.I. Joe vs. Cobra: The Essential Guide 1982-2008|last= Hidalgo|first= Pablo|year= 2009|publisher= Random House|isbn= 978-0-345-51642-8|page=21}}</ref> Before he enlisted in the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]], Roadblock wanted to be a gourmet chef, and was working as a bouncer to earn enough money to attend [[Escoffier]] School in [[France]]. An army recruiter convinced him that he could learn to be a chef in the Army. After enlisting, Roadblock found Army food appalling, and transferred to infantry where he excelled at using heavy weapons. Roadblock is one of the biggest and strongest members of G.I. Joe, able to carry a fully loaded [[M2 Browning machine gun]] as a personal weapon, which can weigh up to 134&nbsp;lbs, and usually requires a dedicated squad to transport and operate. Despite working in infantry, he still maintains his passion for making good food, and indulges in it while engaging in his secondary duty. He is a qualified expert with the [[M2 Browning]] .50 cal heavy machine gun, all [[Warsaw Pact]] heavy machine guns, [[M16 rifle|M-16]], and the [[M1911|M-1911A1 auto pistol]].<ref>{{cite book |title= G.I. Joe Order Of Battle|last= Hama|first= Larry|editor= Howard Mackie|year= 1987|publisher= [[Marvel Entertainment Group]]|isbn= 0-87135-288-5|page= 83}}</ref>

When the G.I. Joe team temporarily disbanded, Roadblock finally took the opportunity to become a gourmet chef. He wrote several cookbooks that became best-sellers, endorsed a line of cooking products under his name, and briefly hosted his own television cooking show. But when the team was reinstated, he happily hung up his chef's hat and rejoined them once again, staying on when the team was re-activated with a reduced roster.<ref>{{cite book |title= G.I. Joe: Battle Files #1|last= Wherle|first= Scott|year= 2002|publisher= Devil's Due Publishing|isbn= |page=19}}</ref>

In the UK [[Action Force]] toy series, Roadblock is originally from the [[French Congo]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bloodforthebaron.com/toys/003/af/030/index.html |title=Roadblock |publisher=Bloodforthebaron.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-18}}</ref> As the Action Force and G.I. Joe toy lines merged, his profile altered to the American variant.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bloodforthebaron.com/toys/004/af/064/index.html |title=Roadblock |publisher=Bloodforthebaron.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-18}}</ref>

In the animated series, Roadblock is depicted as speaking in rhyme. He has a cousin named [[Heavy Duty (G.I. Joe)|Heavy Duty]].

Additionally, G.I. Joe issued a 12" Roadblock action figure for the 1992 Hall of Fame series that brought back the 12" G.I.

Roadblock's head is bald and the face has a mustache. Some versions have a small goatee on the chin. An action figure called [[Double Blast]] used one of the Roadblock molds causing fear in [[Fan (aficionado)|fans]] that Hasbro lost the rights to Roadblock's name. Interestingly enough, Hasbro released a figure named Roadblock with Double Blast's information and real name on the filecard. All other versions of Roadblock have been remakes of the original.

==Comics==
===Marvel Comics===
Unlike the cartoon version, the comic book Roadblock does not spout rhymes, and is mentioned to have a fierce temper that "is a long time building, and a long time going". He has been known to say things like "Flush 'em out with a burst of fifty 'cal", meaning force enemies out into the open with concentrated fire from his .50 caliber machinegun.

Roadblock first appeared in [[Marvel Comics]]' ''G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero'' #22 (April 1984). In that issue he is standing guard with [[Duke (G.I. Joe)|Duke]]. They are overlooking the funeral of [[General Flagg]], which is taking place at [[Arlington National Cemetery]]. Cobra attacks the funeral with a [[Rattler (G.I. Joe)|Rattler]] plane. Before anyone is hurt, Roadblock and Duke shoot it down, killing the pilot.<ref>''G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero'' #22 (April 1984)</ref>

In the next issue, Roadblock is part of a Joe team attempting to keep [[Cobra Commander]] prisoner in the [[Rocky Mountains]]. The ninja [[Storm Shadow (G.I. Joe)|Storm Shadow]] manages to rescue the Commander, though he himself is captured by Roadblock.<ref>''G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero'' #23 (May 1984)</ref>

In issue #69, while in an American [[embassy]] that is being looted, Roadblock threatens a man who is intending to burn an American flag. Roadblock aims his weapon at the man's head, asking him to "desist in your actions or I will be obliged to reduce your head to a fine red mist." When the threatened man points out how looters are stealing typewriters, Roadblock states that "Nobody ever died for a typewriter." The man backs down.<ref>''G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero'' #69 (March 1, 1988)</ref>

In issues #77 and #78, he and other Joes battle American agents who are trying to frame and arrest every single G.I. Joe member. Roadblock is originally captured along with [[Hawk (G.I. Joe)|Hawk]] and ally General Hollingsworth. He violently escapes from captivity in order to organize the resistance movement. He manages to organize a group of Joe allies, along with the unexpected assistance of Destro, temporarily halting the conspiracy.<ref>''G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero'' #77-78 (October 1988)</ref>

In another incident, detailed in the ''Secret Missions'' series, Roadblock and [[Chuckles (G.I. Joe)|Chuckles]] escort a [[Harvard University|Harvard]]-educated African prince back to his homeland, to help him stabilize a power struggle. Despite the Joes' assistance in saving the prince's life (who is a capable fighter in his own right), the man evicts all foreign embassies from his soil.{{Issue|date=December 2009}}

In issue #145, Roadblock is chosen to go into space with the [[Star Brigade (G.I. Joe)|Star Brigade]], a small team of Joe members. They travel on board the Joes' own space shuttle, the ''[[Defiant (G.I. Joe)|Defiant]]''. The team fights rampaging robots inside an asteroid that threatens all of Earth. The Joes, along with the [[Oktober Guard]], destroy the asteroid, saving billions of lives.<ref>''G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero'' #145 (Feb. 1, 1994)</ref>

Issue #154 is a Roadblock story in which, on his way to a cooking competition, he ends up on a civilian plane loaded with Cobra Vipers. Roadblock acquires a rocket launcher from the cargo hold, parachutes out of the plane, and destroys it with the weapon.<ref>''G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero'' #154 (Nov. 1, 1994)</ref>

===Devil's Due Comics===
The Joe team spends much time inactive. When Cobra is revealed to be a threat yet again, Roadblock, now making a living as a chef, eagerly answers the call to reform the team.<ref>"G.I. Joe: A Great American Hero" Vol1 #1 (2001)</ref> He is one of those stricken by the nanite virus but recovers.<ref>"G.I. Joe: A Great American Hero" Vol1 #2-4 (2002)</ref>

Roadblock gains his own television cooking show. It ends up that [[Tomax and Xamot]], Cobra operatives, own the show; they decide to have the studios destroyed to cover up [[money laundering]] crimes. Roadblock ends up fighting overeager Dreadnoks on stage, which just increases his popularity, including sales of his Marvin Hinton Grill.<ref>''G.I. Joe Frontline'' #18 (December 2003)</ref>

In the alternate continuity of Devil's Due ''G.I. Joe Versus Transformers'', Roadblock is one of the few Joes to pilot large, humanoid robots. They befriend and team up with the Autobots to stop a conspiracy happening literally below their own headquarters.{{Issue|date=December 2009}}
