professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays for English club [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]], on loan from [[Atl<U+00E9>tico Madrid]], and the [[Belgium national football team|Belgium national team]]. Mainly a [[Defender (association football)#Centre-back|central defender]], he can also play as a [[Defender (association football)#Full-back|right back]].

==Club career==

===Ajax===
Born in [[Antwerp]],<ref>{{Citation |title =Toby Alderweireld profile  | url=http://www.vi.nl/Spelers/Speler.htm?dbid=59198&typeofpage=84137 |publisher=VI.nl| date = 18 January 2009 |accessdate= 19 January 2009}}</ref> Alderweireld moved to [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]]'s [[AFC Ajax Youth Academy|youth academy]] in August 2004 from [[K.F.C.

During the early stages of the [[2009<U+2013>10 Eredivisie|2009<U+2013>10 season]], Alderweireld established himself in the first team and starting eleven. He became first choice centre-back along with fellow Belgian [[Jan Vertonghen]] (Jan Vertonghen now plays for Tottenham Hotspur) after the departure of former captain [[Thomas Vermaelen]] to [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]].<ref>{{cite news|title='Wij hebben de beste selctie van Nederland'|last=Zwartkruis|first=Simon|work=Association football|date=30 September 2009|accessdate=30 September 2009}}</ref> New coach [[Martin Jol]] praised the two defenders and kept faith in the duo after a string of good performances.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.gva.be/nieuws/sport/video/extern-jol-vertonghen-en-alderweireld-dat-ziet-iedereen.aspx|title=Jol: 'Vertonghen en Alderweireld, dat ziet iedereen'|publisher=Gazet van Antwerpen|date=17 October 2009|accessdate=27 October 2009|language=Dutch}}</ref><ref>{{Citation |last=Coerts|first=Stefan |title =Ajax Coach Martin Jol Praises Jan Vertonghen And Toby Alderweireld | url=http://www.goal.com/en/news/462/netherlands/2009/09/30/1532572/ajax-coach-martin-jol-praises-jan-vertonghen-and-toby |work=Goal| date = 13 October 2009 |accessdate=30 September 2009}}</ref> During the 4 September win against [[SC Heracles Almelo|Heracles]] that ended 3<U+2013>0, he scored his first league goal for the club when he opened the scoring with a header from [[Luis Su<U+00E1>rez]]'s corner.<ref>[http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=271817&cc=3888&league=NED.1 Report: SC Heracles Almelo vs Ajax Amsterdam]</ref> On 27 January, he scored a late equaliser in extra time during the [[2009-10 KNVB Cup|KNVB Cup]] [[2009-10 KNVB Cup#Quarter finals|quarter final]] against [[NEC Nijmegen]] and [[Siem de Jong]]'s late goal five minutes before the final whistle sealed a 3<U+2013>2 win for Ajax. At the end of the [[2009<U+2013>10 Eredivisie|2009<U+2013>10 season]], Alderweireld was named "Ajax Talent of the Year".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraaf.nl/telesport/voetbal/6550355/__Supporters_Ajax_eren_Suarez__.html |title=Supporters Ajax eren Suarez |publisher=Telegraaf.nl |date=18 April 2010 |accessdate=2010-04-21}}</ref> He assured himself of a place in the Eredivisie giants' history books on 3 November 2011, heading in Ajax's 100th UEFA Champions League goal in the 2<U+2013>1 Group G defeat by AJ Auxerre.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/memberassociations/association=ned/news/newsid=1590396.html |title=Ajax's Alderweireld thrives on art of defending |publisher=UEFA.com by Berend Scholten|date=5 February 2011 |accessdate=2011-02-05}}</ref> In the [[2010-11 Eredivisie|2010<U+2013>11 season]], he scored a stunning 25-yard strike at the [[San Siro]] against [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] group rivals [[AC Milan]] in a 0<U+2013>2 away win. He followed this spectacular goal with an even more impressive 32-yard strike against [[Feyenoord Rotterdam|Feyenoord]] in a 2<U+2013>0 home win.

In the 2011<U+2013>12 season Alderweireld has made significant strides in his ability as a footballer. He has also formed a formidable partnership in the heart of the Ajax defensive with captain and fellow Belgian Jan Verthongen. Alderweireld has also showed some impressive offensive ability scoring a remarkable goal against [[SC Heerenveen]] in Week 2.

On 5 August 2012, during the [[2012 Johan Cruijff Schaal|Johan Cruijff Schaal]] encounter between [[PSV Eindhoven|PSV]] and Ajax, Alderweireld managed to score for Ajax in the 44th minute, bringing his club back within a goals difference going into halftime 2<U+2013>1. Unfortunately, it was a match Ajax would lose 4<U+2013>2, making it the third Dutch Super Cup that Alderweireld participated in and finished as runners-up. The following 2012<U+2013>13 season however would be a successful one, marking the third year in a row that Alderweireld would play [[UEFA Champions League]] football, and also winning his third consecutive [[Eredivisie]] title for Ajax and 32nd overall, having played as a starting Center Back for Ajax in all three championship pursuits. Alderweireld scored a further three goals that season for Ajax, including two goals during the regular season against [[PEC Zwolle]] and [[FC Twente]], as well as scoring another goal in a 2<U+2013>0 home victory against [[Steaua Bucure<U+0219>ti]] at the [[Amsterdam Arena]], in the first leg of the 32nd Round of the [[2012<U+2013>13 UEFA Europa League]]. Having been drawn into a group with [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]], [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] and eventual runners-up [[Borussia Dortmund]] during their Champions League campaign, Ajax had entered into the Europa League at the knockout phase having secured third place in their group, but failed to advance, losing in the second leg match in [[Romania]] 4<U+2013>2 on penalty kicks after extra time.

With one more year remaining on his contract, Alderweireld opted not to extend his contract with Ajax, and received plenty of interest during the off season, with [[Bayer 04 Leverkusen|Bayer Leverkusen]], [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], [[S.S.C. Napoli|Napoli]] and [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] being mentioned as the most keen to sign the young defender.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.express.de/bayer-04-leverkusen/alderweireld-soll-kommen-kadlec-wechselt-zu-fenerbahce,3288,23318686.html |title=Alderweireld soll kommen Kadlec wechselt zu Fenerbahce |publisher=Express.de by Lars Werner.com|date=14 June 2013 |accessdate=2013-06-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nieuws.be/nieuws/Napoli_wil_tien_miljoen_euro_betalen_voor_Toby_Alderweireld_6c3bab42.aspx |title=Napoli wil tien miljoen euro betalen voor Toby Alderweireld |publisher=Nieuws.be by Voetbal4U.com|date=18 June 2013 |accessdate=2013-06-19}}</ref>

===Atl<U+00E9>tico Madrid===
On 2 September 2013, Alderweireld joined [[Atl<U+00E9>tico Madrid]] on a four-year contract for an estimated <U+20AC>7 million (<U+00A3>6.16 m) transfer fee.<ref>{{cite web|title=Transfer deadline day: Atletico Madrid sign Toby Alderweireld and Josuha Guilavogui|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11838/8903655/transfer-deadline-day-atletico-madrid-sign-toby-alderweireld-and-josuha-guilavogui|publisher=Sky Sports|accessdate=31 August 2014|date=2 September 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Corrigan|first1=Dermot|title=Toby Alderweireld rejected Liverpool|url=http://www.espnfc.com/story/1543223/toby-alderweireld-rejected-liverpool-move-to-join-atletico-madrid|publisher=ESPN FC|accessdate=31 August 2014|date=3 September 2013}}</ref>

He was loaned to [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] on 1 September 2014.<ref>{{cite news|title=Southampton loan Toby Alderweireld from Atletico Madrid|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29025087|accessdate=2 September 2014|work=[[BBC Sport]]|date=2 September 2014}}</ref>

==International career==
[[File:Eddie Johnson shoots past Toby Alderweireld USA vs Belgium.jpg|thumb|Alderweireld playing against the [[USMNT|United States]] in 2013]]
Alderweireld first represented [[Belgium]] at [[Belgium national youth football team|U17 level]] in October 2005 and took part in the [[2006 UEFA European Under-17 Football Championship|2006 UEFA U17 Championship]]. After the [[2008<U+2013>09 Eredivisie|2008<U+2013>09 season]] concluded, he made his senior debut for the [[Belgium national football team|Belgian national team]] in a friendly tournament. However his full senior debut came three months later, in a match against the [[Czech Republic national football team|Czech Republic]]. He was named in several [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|2010 World Cup qualifying]] squads, but was mostly an unused substitute. In October 2009, he came on as a second-half substitute for [[Daniel Van Buyten]] in the 2<U+2013>0 defeat to [[Estonia national football team|Estonia]].

Alderweireld was called up to the [[Belgium national under-21 football team|Belgian U21 squad]] for the [[2011 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship qualification|2011 UEFA U21 Championship qualifier]] against [[Ukraine national under-21 football team|Ukraine]] on 13 November 2009, with the match finishing 2<U+2013>0 to Ukraine. He played [[Defender (football)|right back]] during
the [[UEFA Euro 2012|2012 UEFA Euro qualification]] match against [[Turkey national football team|Turkey]] on 7 September 2010.

On 13 May 2014, Alderweireld was named in the squad to go to the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Adnan Januzaj included in Belgium's World Cup squad|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/27395150|accessdate=15 May 2014|newspaper=[[BBC Sport]]|date=13 May 2014}}</ref> He started in Belgium's first game of the tournament, a 2<U+2013>1 win against [[Algeria national football team|Algeria]] in [[Belo Horizonte]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Chowdhury|first1=Saj|title=Belgium 2-1 Algeria|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/25285127|accessdate=17 June 2014|work=[[BBC Sport]]|date=17 June 2014}}</ref>
