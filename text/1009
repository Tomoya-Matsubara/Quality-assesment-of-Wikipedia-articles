{{Nihongo|'''''Dragon Quest'''''|<U+30C9><U+30E9><U+30B4><U+30F3><U+30AF><U+30A8><U+30B9><U+30C8>}}, published as '''''Dragon Warrior''''' in [[North America]] until 2005,<ref group=Note>Due to the inconsistant usage by sources since Square Enix obtained the naming rights to ''Dragon Quest'' in North America, ''Dragon Quest'' is used to refer to games also released solely under the ''Dragon Warrior'' titles. So for this article, the title ''Dragon Quest'' will be used in preference to ''Dragon Warrior'' except when talking about those specific North American releases.</ref> is a series<U+2014>currently nine main series titles and numerous spinoff titles<U+2014>of internationally best-selling console [[role-playing video game]] (RPVG) titles created by [[Yuji Horii]] and his studio, Armor Project, and published by [[Square Enix]] (formerly [[Enix]]). The first title was published in 1986. The series has significantly impacted the development of console RPGs, and introduced a number of features to the genre. Installments of the series have appeared on [[MSX]] computers, [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] (NES), [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] (SNES), [[Game Boy Color]] (GBC), [[Game Boy Advance]] (GBA), [[Nintendo DS]], [[PlayStation]] (PS1), [[PlayStation 2]] (PS2), [[Wii]] [[video game console]]s, and several models of [[mobile phone]]. Nearly every game in the main series has an [[anime]] and [[manga]] adaptation. Each ''Dragon Quest'' video game soundtrack is arranged into an orchestral piece; the series was the first to have a soundtrack performed by a live orchestra.

Earlier on in the series, ''Dragon Quest'' games were released under the title ''Dragon Warrior'' in North America to avoid [[trademark]] conflict with the [[role-playing game]] (RPG) ''Dragon Quest'', which was published by [[Simulations Publications]] in the 1980s until the company's 1982 [[bankruptcy]] and acquisition by [[TSR, Inc.]]. TSR continued publishing the line as an alternative to ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' (D&D) until 1987,<ref name="spy">{{cite web | title=The GameSpy Hall of Fame: Dragon Warrior  | publisher=[[Gamespy]] |url=http://www.gamespy.com/articles/492/492001p1.html |accessdate=2005-05-29}}</ref> and in 2003, Square Enix registered the ''Dragon Quest'' trademark in the United States.

The basic premise of most ''Dragon Quest'' titles is to play a hero who, usually with a group of [[Party (role playing games)|party members]], is out to save the land from peril at the hands of a powerful evil enemy. Common elements persist throughout the series and its spinoff titles: [[Turn-based game|turn-based combat]]; recurring monsters, including [[Slime (Dragon Quest)|Slime]], which has become the series' mascot; text-based menu systems until the English version of ''[[Dragon Quest VIII: Journey of the Cursed King]]'';<ref group="Note">The Japanese release of ''Dragon Quest VIII'' retains the traditional text menus. However, the Japanese release of ''Dragon Quest IX'' uses the menus based on the English release of ''Dragon Quest VIII''.</ref> and, until ''[[Dragon Quest IX: Sentinels of the Starry Skies]]'', [[random encounter]]s in the main series. The series is known for being one of the few long-running video game series to have a stable key development team.

=== Spinoffs ===
The franchise includes several spinoffs of the main titles, including ''[[Dragon Quest Monsters]]'' and arcade games such as the Japanese ''[[Dragon Quest: Monster Battle Road]]''. In addition, the ''[[Mystery Dungeon]]'' and ''[[Itadaki Street]]'' series use characters and other elements from ''Dragon Quest'' games; the Mystery Dungeon series has also gone on to spawn its own franchise.

In 1993, Chunsoft developed a SNES game that included {{nihongo3|a.k.a.

=== Monsters ===
The ''Dragon Quest'' series features several recurring monsters, including [[Slime (Dragon Quest)|Slime]]s,  Drackies, Shadows, Mummies, Trick Bags, and Dragons.<ref>{{cite book |editor=Prima Games |title=Dragon Warrior I and II Official Strategy Guide |year=2000 |publisher=Prima Publishing |isbn=0-7615-3157-2|pages=46<U+2013>50 and 98<U+2013>105}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |editor=Prima Games |title=Dragon Warrior III Official Strategy Guide |year=2001 |publisher=Prima Publishing|isbn=0-7615-3638-8 |pages=121<U+2013>130}}</ref><ref>{{cite book| editor=Prima Games|title=Dragon Warrior VII Official Strategy Guide|year=2001|publisher=Prima Publishing|isbn=0-7615-3640-X| pages=147<U+2013>155}}</ref> Many monsters in the series were designed by [[Akira Toriyama]]. In ''[[Dragon Quest V: Hand of the Heavenly Bride]]'' monsters can join the player's party and fight in battles.

The Slimes, designed by Toriyama for use in ''Dragon Quest'', have become the official [[mascot]] of the ''Dragon Quest'' series. Series designer Yuji Horii cited the monster as an example of Toriyama's skills, claiming it took artistic "power to take something like a pool of slime and use his imagination to make it a great character."<ref>{{cite web | author=| year=2007 | title=Interview with Yuji Horii | url=http://ds.ign.com/articles/792/792134p1.html | work= |accessdate=2010-02-19}}</ref> A Slime is a small blue blob shaped like a water droplet that has a face.

=== Loto/Erdrick ===
'''Erdrick'''<ref group="Note">Edrick is known as '''Loto''' in the North American remakes of the Game Boy Color of the first three games</ref> is a legendary hero from the ''Dragon Quest'' series. The first three ''Dragon Quest'' games comprise the "Erdrick [[trilogy]]" and are all connected to the legend of Erdrick. He is known in the game as the hero who freed the Kingdom of Alefgard from darkness.<ref group="Note">In ''Dragon Warrior'' Alefgard is referred to as a kingdom, but in ''Dragon Warrior II'' it is shown to be a continent.</ref><ref name="dw_manual">(1989) Nintendo, Enix Corporation ''Dragon Warrior Instruction Manual''.</ref> The name Erdrick was first mentioned in the English [[Language localization|localization]], ''Dragon Warrior'', in which the player is referred to as Erdrick's descendant.<ref name="np7_40">Editors of Nintendo Power:''Nintendo Power July<U+2013>August, 1989; issue 7''. Nintendo of America, Tokuma Shoten Publishing, 40.</ref> Erdrick's legend was completed with the 1991 release of ''Dragon Warrior III''.

In ''Dragon Warrior'', Erdrick was the ancestor of the Hero. The Hero follows in the footsteps of Erdrick to reach the Dragonlord's Castle and confront the[[Dragonlord (Dragon Quest)|Dragonlord]]. In ''Dragon Warrior II'', the heroes are descendants of Erdrick, and also the Hero from ''Dragon Warrior''.<ref name="dw2_manual">Enix Corporation ''Unveiled Secrets of Dragon Warrior II''  Enix America Corporation.</ref><ref name="np16_67">Editors of Nintendo Power:''Nintendo Power September/October, 1990; issue 16''. Nintendo of America, Tokuma Shoten Publishing, 67.</ref> They explore the expanded world of Torland, including the continent of Alefgard. At the end of ''Dragon Warrior III'', the King of Alefgard bestows upon the Hero the "Order of Erdrick", the country's highest honor reserved for true heroes. In ''Dragon Warrior III'', Erdrick's origins are revealed;  the chronological order of the first three games is ''Dragon Quest III'', ''Dragon Quest I'', and then ''Dragon Quest II''.<ref>{{cite web |first=Brad| last=Shoemaker | year=2001 | title=Dragon Warrior III preview |url=http://www.gamespot.com/gbc/rpg/dragonwarrior3/review.html |publisher=[[Gamespot]] | accessdate=2007-09-16}}</ref> This chronology is further evidenced in the naming of the hero's weapon, armor, and shield.  After the events of ''Dragon Warrior III'', the hero's armaments are renamed as the Erdrick (or Loto) Sword and Armor in ''Dragon Warrior I'' and ''Dragon Warrior II''. Writing "Erdrick" as a name for the player in ''Dragon Warrior III'' is impossible. After typing "Erdrick", a window that reads "INPUT YOUR NAME!" opens.

In the original ''[[Final Fantasy (video game)|Final Fantasy]]'', [[Square (company)|Square]] parodies ''Dragon Warrior'' by displaying a grave for Erdrick in the town of Elfland.<ref>{{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy|developer=Square|publisher=Nintendo|date=1990-07-12|platform=Nintendo Entertainment System|level=Elfland}}</ref>

=== Zenithia ===
'''Zenithia''', also called '''Zenith Castle''' or simply '''Zenith''', is a "sky castle" location that first appears in ''Dragon Quest IV'', and is also one of several elements the following two games: ''Dragon Quest V'' and ''Dragon Quest VI''. Its appearance in all three games suggests they are linked as a [[trilogy]]. These games are often referred to as the ''Tenk<U+016B>'' (Japanese for Heaven), or the ''Tenk<U+016B> no Shiro'' (''Castle in the Sky'') trilogy.<ref>{{cite web | first=Jonathan|last=Creswell | year=2007 | title=Dragon Quest IV, V, VI |url=http://www.britishgaming.co.uk/2009/02/newswire-a-day-in-the-life-of-a-games-journalist/| publisher=British Gaming | accessdate=2007-09-17}}</ref> Horii explained that a trilogy was never the intention: "Each ''Dragon Quest'' title represents a fresh start and a new story, so I don't see too much of a connection between the games in the series. I guess it could be said that the imagination of players has brought the titles together in a certain fashion."<ref name="julynp">{{cite journal |last1= |first1= |year=2008 |month=July |title= |journal=Nintendo Power|publisher=[[Future US]] |volume= |issue=7 |pages=50<U+2013>57 |url= |doi= }}</ref>
In ''Dragon Quest IV'', Zenithia can be accessed by climbing the tower near the Gottside region (called Azimuth in the DQ4DS release). It is above the entrance to the world of darkness. In ''Dragon Quest V'', Zenithia has fallen into a lake south of Elheaven. This happened when the ''Golden Orb'', half of a set of magical orbs that supported the castle in the sky, fell from its place. Once recovered and returned to Master Dragon, Zenithia will rise again. This time, the castle can move freely around in the sky. In ''Dragon Quest VI'', Zenith Castle is sealed by Demon Lord Durran, and a large hole is left in its place in the ''Dream World''. When the ''Dream World'' returns to its natural state, Zenith Castle is the only part that remains visible and floats above the real world. A castle in the''Dragon Quest III'' remakes for the Super Famicom and GBC is also called Zenith, although the layout differs from the castle in the Tenku series.<ref>{{cite book |editor=Prima Games|title=Dragon Warrior III Official Strategy Guide |year=2001 |publisher=Prima Publishing |isbn=0-7615-3638-8 |pages=87<U+2013>89}}</ref>

=== Mini medals ===
{{Quote box|quote=I wanted the fun of collecting these things in the game. Saying that though, if it were the case that 'You can't clear ''IV'' without gathering gem stones' it would be just following the same old pattern, so I went and made it something that has nothing to do with clearing the game. The people who find them, depending on how many they find, are given useful items! That's the way I made it.|source=[[Yuji Horii]] on the introduction of mini medals to ''Dragon Quest''<ref name=Jump8/>|width=45%|align=right}}
Starting with ''Dragon Quest IV'', a new collectable item known as mini medals were introduced. These mini medals have since been used in every main ''Dragon Quest'' title. The medals resemble small gold coins with a five-point star in the middle. The player collects these medals throughout the game by opening chests, breaking pots and barrels and searching sacks and drawers. In ''Dragon Quest IX'', the player can also obtain some by completing quests or from a [[Spawning (video gaming)|spawn]] point on the world map. At a certain point during the game, the player meets a character he can trade these medals for items. From ''Dragon Quest IV'' through ''VII'' this was a reoccurring character known as the Mini Medal King. While he is replaced in later ''Dragon Quest'' titles, he continue to be referenced. In ''Dragon Quest VIII'' he makes an appearance, but it is his daughter who collects the medals. In ''Dragon Quest IX'', although the medals are collected by a pirate captain, the dialog references his connection to the Mini Medal Kings.

According to Horii, he wanted to have something the player went around collecting as the previous ''Dragon Quest'' games had crests and orbs respectively. However, he did not want to do the same thing over again by forcing the player to collect a certain number of items before they beat the game; mini medals instead have nothing to do with clearing the game.<ref name=Jump8>{{cite book|title=<U+9031><U+520A><U+5C11><U+5E74><U+30B8><U+30E3><U+30F3><U+30D7>|trans_title=[[Weekly Sh<U+014D>nen Jump]]|volume=45|year=1989|publisher=Kazuhiko Torishima|location=Japan|language=Japanese|page=8}}</ref>

== Development ==
The series monsters, characters, and box art were designed by Toriyama.<ref name="1up Horii interview"/> The [[video game music|music]] for the ''Dragon Quest'' series was composed by Sugiyama.<ref name="design">{{cite web | title=The Designers Of Dragon Quest | publisher=IGN|url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/379/379052p1.html |accessdate=2005-05-29}}</ref> In the past, ''Dragon Quest'' games have been developed by [[Chunsoft]], [[Heart Beat (company)|Heartbeat]], [[Artepiazza]], and starting with ''Dragon Quest VIII'', [[Level-5]].<ref>{{cite web | first=Bryan| last=Boulette | year=2006 |title=Square Enix: Dinosaur or Leader |url=http://www.rpgamer.com/editor/2006/q3/080706aca.html|publisher=RPGamer | accessdate=2007-09-24}}</ref> Horii's company, Armor Project, is in charge of the ''Dragon Quest'' games that were published by Enix and Square Enix.

=== History ===
In 1982, Enix sponsored a video game programming contest in Japan which brought much of the ''Dragon Quest'' team together, including creator [[Yuji Horii]].<ref name="design" /> The prize was a trip to the United States and a visit to AppleFest '83 in San Francisco, where Horii discovered the ''[[Wizardry]]'' video game series.<ref name="kurt"/> The contest winners, Koichi Nakamura and Yukinobu Chida, with Horii, released the Enix [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] game''[[The Portopia Serial Murder Case]]''. Music composer [[Koichi Sugiyama]], known for composing jingles and pop songs, was impressed with the group's work and sent a postcard to Enix praising the software.<ref name="symph" /> In response, Enix asked him to compose music for some of its games. The group then decided to make a RPVG that combines elements from the western RPVGs ''Wizardry'' and ''Ultima''.<ref group=Note>While Wizardry and Ultima are under the broad category of role-playing video games, they are [[personal computer game]]s, not [[video game console]] games.</ref><ref name="npinterview">{{cite book |editor=|title=Nintendo Power volume 221 |year=2007 |publisher=[[Future US]]|isbn=|pages=78<U+2013>80}}</ref> Horii wanted to introduce the concept of RPVGs to the wider Japanese video game audience. He chose the Famicom because, unlike [[arcade game]]s the player did not have to worry about spending money if they got a [[game over]]. In addition, the player continue playing from where they left off before.<ref name="Iwata Asks: History">{{cite web|url=http://dqnine.com/#/iwata/|title=Dragon Quest: Sential of the Starry Skies|work=Iwata Asks|publisher=Square-Enix|at=Iwata Asks Dragon Quest IX Video 1 The History of Dragon Quest|accessdate=2010-12-05}}</ref> Horii used the full-screen map of ''[[Ultima (series)|Ultima]]'', the battle and statistics-oriented ''Wizardry'' screen, to create the gameplay of ''Dragon Quest''.<ref name="kurt" /> ''[[Dragon Ball]]'' creator and manga artist [[Akira Toriyama]], who knew of Horii through the manga magazine ''[[Weekly Shonen Jump]]'', was commissioned to illustrate the characters and monsters to separate the game from other RPGs of the time.<ref name="npinterview"/> The primary game designs were conceived by Horii before being handed to Toriyama to re-draw under Horii's supervision.<ref>{{cite web | first=Nich|last=Maragos | date=2005-05-19|title=Previews: Dragon Quest VIII |url=http://www.1up.com/previews/dragon-quest-viii_7 | publisher=[[1UP.com]] |accessdate=2007-04-21}}</ref> When Horii first created ''Dragon Quest'', most people doubted that a fantasy series with swords and dungeons instead of science fiction would become popular in Japan; however, the series has become very popular there.<ref name="euro">{{cite web |author= | year=2007| title=Interview with Yuji Horii at EuroGamer.com|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/i_dragonquestviii_ps2|publisher=[[Eurogamer]] |accessdate=2007-09-12}}</ref> Since then, Horii has been the games' scenario director.

The first six ''Dragon Quest'' stories are divided into two trilogies. The first three games of the series tell the story of the legendary hero known as Roto (known as Erdrick or Loto in some versions). ''Dragon Quest IV-VI'' are based around a castle in the sky called Zenithia that is referred to as the ''Tenku'' in Japan, meaning heaven. Games in the main series from ''Dragon Quest VII'' onwards are stand-alone games.<ref>{{cite web |first=Matt|last=Weiss | year=2002 | title=Dragon Warrior 7 review |url=http://www.gamecritics.com/review/dragonwarr7/main.php |publisher=GameCritics| accessdate=2007-09-23}}</ref>

''Dragon Quest'' is not as successful outside Japan being eclipsed by another RPG series, ''[[Final Fantasy]]''. Because of Enix's closure in the mid-1990s, ''Dragon Quest V'' and ''Dragon Quest VI'' were not officially released in North America. In Europe, no games were released prior to the spinoff ''Dragon Warrior Monsters''. With the merger of Squaresoft and Enix in 2003,''Dragon Quest'' games were released in numerous markets.<ref name="euro"/> In May 2008, Square Enix announced localizations of the Nintendo DS remakes of ''Dragon Quest IV'', ''V'', and ''VI'' for North America and the [[PAL region]] that are known collectively as the Zenithia trilogy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://na.square-enix.com/zenithia |title=Dragon Quest |publisher=Square Enix |accessdate=2009-10-02}}</ref> With this announcement, all the main ''Dragon Quest'' games will be released outside of Japan. The ninth installment was released in Japan for Nintendo DS on July 11, 2009. The North American version was released on July 11, 2010, exactly a year after the Japan release, while the European version came out on July 23, 2010. The tenth installment of the main series is currently in development for the Wii.<ref name="reuters"/>

=== Creation and design ===
{{Quote box|quote=At the time I first made ''Dragon Quest'', computer and video game RPGs were still very much in the realm of hardcore fans and not very accessible to other players. So I decided to create a system that was easy to understand and emotionally involving, and then placed my story within that framework.|source=[[Yuji Horii]] on the design of the first ''Dragon Quest''<ref name="npinterview"/>|width=40%|align=right}}
When designing ''Dragon Quest'', Horii play tests the games to make certain the controls feel right. This includes going into maticulous details such as how fast a page opens or the way a door opens. According to Horii,  "...little things like here and there the controls not feeling right and such can really grate the players' nerves if the tempo isn't right." He believes the player should be able to control the game unconsciously, which is not easy to do. Ryutaro Ichimura, who has worked with Dragon Quest titles with Horii since ''Dragon Quest VIII'', has implemented Horii's suggestions even if others cannot see his reasoning immediately.  "a lot of the time when he [Horii] points these things out, we cannot see them at first, but eventually you get it."<ref name="Iwata Asks: Mario">{{cite web|url=http://dqnine.com/#/iwata/|title=Dragon Quest: Sential of the Starry Skies|at=Iwata Asks Dragon Quest IX Video 5 Dragon Quest and Mario similarities|accessdate=2010-12-07}}</ref>

The typical ''Dragon Quest'' plot involves the player controlling a party of heroes to defeat an ultimate evil villain, who usually threatens the world in some way. The plotline often consists of smaller stories that involves encounters with other characters.<ref name="hgone"/> This linear plotline is intentional to help ease the generally high learning curve RPGs have for those unaccustomed to them.<ref name="Iwata Asks: History"/> While the storylines are linear, the gameplay is designed to allows the player to chose decide when and whether to pursue certain storyline paths.<ref name="Iwata Asks: Appeal">{{cite web|url=http://dqnine.com/#/iwata/|title=Dragon Quest: Sential of the Starry Skies|at=Iwata Asks Dragon Quest IX Video 2 The Appeal of Dragon Quest|accessdate=2010-12-05}}</ref> To ensure players continue to enjoy playing the game, no storyline path is made to be without some kind of reward. In addition, to help ease players who may be apprehensive about whether they are on the right path, the distance the character has to travel to get rewarded is less early in the game than later.<ref name="Iwata Asks: Mario"/>

The games feature a number of religious overtones{{ndash}} saving the game (in later games) and reviving characters who have died is performed by clergy in churches. Bishops wander around the overworld of ''Dragon Quest Monsters'' and can heal wounded characters. The final enemy in some of the ''Dragon Quest'' games is called the Demon Lord. For instance, in ''Dragon Quest VII'', the Demon Lord (known as Orgodemir in that particular game) is the final [[boss (video game)|boss]], and there is a [[sidequest]] to battle against God. The first four ''Dragon Quest'' titles were subjected to censorship in their North American localizations, largely in keeping with [[Nintendo|Nintendo of America]]'s content guidelines at the time that placed severe restrictions on religious iconography and mature content. When these games were remade for the Game Boy Color, most censorship was removed.<ref>{{cite web | first=Shahed|last=Ahmed | year=2000 | title=Enix Comments on DQ VII |url=http://www.gamespot.com/ps/rpg/dragonwarrior7/news_2643279.html |publisher=[[Gamespot]] | accessdate=2007-09-12}}</ref> Since ''Dragon Quest VII'', the translated versions of the games have largely followed the originals.<ref>{{cite web | author= | year=2001 | title=E3 2001 Interview |url=http://www.rpgfan.com/features/e32k1-enix/index.html | work=RPGfan |accessdate=2007-09-23}}</ref>

== Cultural impact ==
Starting in ''Dragon Quest III'', Patty's Pub began to appear in ''Dragon Quest'' games. With the release of ''Dragon Quest IX'', this fictional inn became a real-world location. Patty's Pub opened as a tourist destination in [[Akihabara]] after ''IX''{{'}}s release to have a known meetup locations where players' can exchange treasure maps, specifically one particular map where [[boss (video game)|characters who once during normal gameplay]] appear.

According to [[Satoru Iwata]], President of Nintendo, ''Dragon Quest''{{'}}s widespread appeal is that it is "made so that anyone can play it...and anyone can enjoy it depending on their different levels and interests." According to him, ''Dragon Quest'' is designed for anyone to pick up without even needing to read the manual in order to understand it. Ryutaro Ichimura, Producer of Square Enix, who has played the game since he was a child, says the ''Dragon Quest'' storylines allows the player to experience a moving sense of achievement where they take the role of a hero who saving the world.<ref name="Iwata Asks: Appeal"/> Yuji Horii believes the ability to appeal to larger audiences of [[casual game]]rs while not alienating the more [[hardcore game]]rs is due to being able to lower the initial hurdle without making it too easy. Iwata and Ichimura also believe it is because the games are created in a way that allows both groups to pursue their own goals. Casual gamers can enjoy the storyline and battles, but for those who want more, there is still content for them to pursue.<ref name="Iwata Asks: Mario"/>

The original ''Dragon Quest'' game is often cited as the first [[console role-playing game|console RPG]], despite the fact that it borrows heavily from the ''[[Wizardry]]'', ''[[The Black Onyx]]'', and ''[[Ultima (series)|Ultima]]'' series, and that many critics consider ''Final Fantasy'' "more important."<ref name="spy" /> [[GameSpot]] called the original ''Dragon Quest'' one of the fifteen most influential games of all time and the "most influential role-playing game of all time", and stated that nearly all Japanese RPGs today have roots in its gameplay.<ref>{{cite web | author=| year=2000 | title=GameSpot's 15 most influential|url=http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/video/15influential/p11_01.html |publisher=[[Gamespot]] | accessdate=2007-09-18}}</ref> ''Dragon Quest V'' is cited as having monster recruiting and training mechanics similar to those seen later in ''[[Pok<U+00E9>mon]]''.<ref name="kurt"/> The ''Dragon Quest'' series was recognized by [[Guinness World Records]] with six world records in the [[Guinness World Records Gamer's Edition]]. These records include "Best Selling Role Playing Game on the Super Famicom", "Fastest Selling Game in Japan", and "First Video Game Series to Inspire a Ballet".<ref>{{cite web | year=2008 | title=Weird and Wonderful Records| url=http://gamers.guinnessworldrecords.com/records/weird_and_wonderful.aspx| archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080329065414/http://gamers.guinnessworldrecords.com/records/weird_and_wonderful.aspx| archivedate=2008-03-29 |publisher=[[Guinness Book of World Records]] | accessdate=2008-09-17}}</ref>

The ''Dragon Quest'' series has sold over 54 million units worldwide.{{#tag:ref|By February 2010 Dragon Quest had sold 53 million copies. Since then, Dragon Quest IX was released overseas selling over 1 million.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/dragon-quest-ix-sentinels-of-the-starry-skies-summer-2010-launch-confirmed-on-nintendo-dstm-in-north-america-europe-and-australia-85434837.html|publisher=[[PR Newswire]] | date=2010-02-25 |accessdate=2011-02-07 | title=Press Release: Dragon Quest IX: Sentinels of the Stary Skies, Summer 2010 Launch Confirmed on Nintendo DS(TM) in North America, Europe and Australia}}</ref><ref name="DQ9 1m">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/ds/rpg/dragonquestix/news.html?sid=6296945|title=Donkey Kong Country Returns sells 4.2 million|publisher=[[Gamespot]]|date=January 31, 2011|accessdate=February 6, 2011}}</ref>|group=Note}} Although the series is extremely popular in Japan, by 2002 the games' success in Japan has not transferred to North America.<ref name="spy" /> Although the first four games to be released in America generally received good reviews, and as of February 2008 they were among the most sought after titles for NES, especially ''Dragon Warrior III'' and ''IV'',<ref name=kurt/> it was not until ''Dragon Warrior VII'' was released that ''Dragon Quest'' became critically acclaimed.<ref name="spy" /> With ''Dragon Quest VIII''the series began to sell well internally and ''Dragon Quest IX'' sold over 1 million copies outside Japan.<ref name="anoop"/><ref name="DQ9 1m"/>

One of the main aspects of the series that critics point out, either positively or negatively, is that the series "never strays from its classic roots."<ref name="gsyp2">{{cite web | author= | year=2005 | title=GameSpy: Dragon Quest 8 Review |url=http://ps2.gamespy.com/playstation-2/dragon-warrior-viii/669330p1.html|publisher=[[Gamespy]] | accessdate=2007-09-19}}</ref> Unlike other modern, complex RPVGs, ''Dragon Quest'' retains the simple gameplay from the first game that many critics find refreshing and nostalgic.<ref name="gsyp2" /><ref>{{cite web |first=Chris |last=Kohler | year=2007 | title=Hands-on with Dragon Quest IV |url=http://www.wired.com/gamelife/2007/09/hands-on-dragon/#more |publisher=''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' | accessdate=2007-09-23}}</ref> Other points of contention are its battle system, comparatively simplistic storylines, lack of character development, simplistic, primitive-looking graphics (in earlier titles), and the overall difficulty of the game. These arguments are countered by noting its strength in episodic storytelling with the various [[non-player character]]s the party meets. The stories avoid melodrama and feature more simplistic characters than ''Final Fantasy''{{'}}s [[Squall Leonhart]] or [[Tidus]], who is a source of contention. Battles are simple and finish quickly. As for the difficulty, Yuji Horii is noted as a gambler. The lack of save points and the general difficulty of the battles were included with the intention of adding a sense of tension. Because of this added difficulty, the punishment for the party's death was toned down compared to other games by simply going back where you last saved with half of your gold on hand.<ref name="kurt"/>
