The '''Roosevelt Room''' is a meeting room in the [[West Wing]] of the [[White House]], the official home and principal workplace of the [[President of the United States]]. Located almost in the center of the West Wing, and near the [[Oval Office]] the room is named for two related U.S. presidents, [[Theodore Roosevelt]] and [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]]. The two arguably contributed more than any other presidents to the design and construction of the West Wing. 

Theodore Roosevelt hired architect [[Charles Follen McKim]] to reorganize the layout and use of the White House. This included constructing the West Wing in 1902 and moving executive offices out of the central White House. The original structure, some of which is still extant in the present West Wing was originally intended to be temporary. With some modifications by [[William Howard Taft]] the West Wing remained largely unchanged until a fire on December 24, 1929 during the administration of [[Herbert Hoover]]. Because of the recent stock market crash, Hoover chose only to repair rather than expand. In 1933, early in the administration of Franklin Roosevelt, the president began a series of meetings with staff architect Eric Gugler to enlarge and modify the West Wing. Roosevelt moved Taft's Oval Office, centered on the south side of the wing, to its present location in the southeast corner adjacent to the [[White House Rose Garden|Rose Garden]]. This made moving to and from the [[Executive Residence]] to the Oval Office quicker, and allowed for more privacy, a concern in concealing [[Franklin D. Roosevelt's paralytic illness|FDR's paralysis]].

The present Roosevelt Room is located where the Teddy Roosevelt's first West Wing office was. When FDR reconstructed the West Wing he used the present room for staff meetings, larger meetings with members of Congress. Franklin Roosevelt kept an aquarium and hung several mounted fish in the room, and the room became "the fish room." President [[John F. Kennedy|Kennedy]] continued the fish name and hung a large mounted sail fish on the wall. In 1969 President [[Richard M. Nixon|Nixon]] gave the room its present name, the Roosevelt Room, to honor Theodore Roosevelt who first built the West Wing, and FDR who expanded it.

The east wall of the room is a half circle, with a centered fireplace and doors on either side. Cast bronze bas-relief plaques with profile portraits of Theodore Roosevelt by [[James Earle Fraser]] and of FDR by [[John DeStefano]] hung on the south wall until removal during a refurbishment during the second term of President [[George W. Bush]]. The room has no windows and is lit by a false skylight. A large conference table seating a maximum of 16 is located in the center. The room is painted a buff color with white trim. A [[triglyph]] molding, similar to that found in [[Independence Hall (United States)|Independence Hall]] encircles the room. The furniture is mostly twentieth century reproductions of [[Thomas Chippendale|Chippendale]] and [[Queen Anne Style architecture|Queen Anne Style]] furniture.

Traditionally paintings of both presidents Roosevelt have hung in the room. Even before President Nixon's formal naming of the Roosevelt Room a tradition existed of Democratic administrations hanging [[Alfred Jonniaux]]'s portrait of FDR over the mantel with Teddy Roosevelt's equestrian portrait by Tade Styka titled "[[Rough Rider]]" hung on the south wall. Republican administrations would, in turn, hang Teddy Roosevelt's painting above the mantel and move FDR's portrait to the south wall. [[Bill Clinton]] decided to keep the landscape formatted Teddy Roosevelt portrait above the mantel and FDR's portrait on the south wall. During the second term of the George W. Bush administration the painting of FDR was removed from the room.

The Roosevelt Room continues to be used for staff meetings, and is increasingly used to announce the appointment or nomination of new staff members. The room is also used as a preparation room by large delegations meeting with the president before entering the Oval Office.
