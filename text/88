The '''Twin Quasar''' (Double Quasar) or ''Old Faithful'' is also known as '''''Q0957+561''''', or '''QSO 0957+561'''. It was the first identified [[gravitational lens|gravitationally lensed]] object.

'''Q0957+561 A''' (QSO 0957+561 A) and '''Q-0957+561 B''' (QSO 0957+561 B) is a double-imaged quasar, meaning that an intervening mass concentration between [[Earth]] and the [[quasar]] bends light so that two images of the quasar appear in the sky. This is known as [[gravitational lensing]], and is a consequence of Einsteinian warped [[space-time]]. The quasar lies at [[redshift]] ''z'' = 1.41(8.7 billion [[light year|ly]]), while the lensing galaxy lies at redshift ''z'' = 0.355 (3.7 billion [[light year|ly]]). The lensing galaxy lies almost in line with the B image, lying 1" off. The quasar lies 10" north of [[NGC 3079]], in the [[constellation]] [[Ursa Major]].

The Twin Quasar's two images are separated by 6". Both images have an [[apparent magnitude]] of 17, with the A component having 16.7 and the B component having 16.5 . There is a 1.14 year time lag between the two images.{{Fact|date=October 2007}}

The lensing galaxy, '''[[YGKOW G1]]'''<ref>http://vizier.cfa.harvard.edu/viz-bin/Dic?YGKOW</ref> (sometimes called ''G1'' or ''Q0957+561 G1''), is a giant [[Elliptical galaxy|elliptical]] (type cD) lying within a cluster of galaxies that also contribute to the lensing.

A microlensing event in [[1996]] observed by [[R. E. Schild]] in the A lobe has led to a controversial, and unconfirmable theory that there is a planet approximately three Earth masses in size in the lensing galaxy.  The speculation cannot be confirmed because the chance alignment that led to its discovery will never happen again. If it could be confirmed, however, it would make it the most distant known planet.

[[Rudy Schild]] announced findings which suggest that the object at the heart of Q0957+561 is not a [[supermassive black hole]], as is believed to be the case for all quasars. Schild's team at the [[Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics]] found that the jets originated 8000 AU from the poles of the centre, in a region 1000AU across, and that ''"this quasar appears to be dynamically dominated by a magnetic field internally anchored to its central, rotating supermassive compact object" ([[Rudy E. Schild]])''. The accretion disc ends at 2000AU from the centre, and the inner edge is intensely radiating. There also appears to be a broad conic outflow from the [[accretion disc]]. This outflow shines in an [[Elvis structure]] (cf. [[Martin Elvis]]).
