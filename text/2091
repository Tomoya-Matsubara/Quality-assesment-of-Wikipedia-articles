== History ==
=== Formation and ''NOLA'' ===
[[Image:Phil Anselmo.jpg|thumb|left|Phil Anselmo formed Down along with Pepper Keenan, Kirk Windstein, Todd Strange, and Jimmy Bower in 1991.]]

Down formed in 1991 with vocalist [[Phil Anselmo]] of [[Pantera]], guitarist [[Pepper Keenan]] of [[Corrosion of Conformity]], second guitarist [[Kirk Windstein]] of [[Crowbar (US band)|Crowbar]], bassist [[Todd Strange]] of Crowbar, and drummer [[Jimmy Bower]] of [[Eyehategod]]. All of the band members were long-time friends and were known from their respective bands, making them a [[supergroup]]. The band made a three track demo for underground trading. The band members would ask heavy metal fans if they have "heard of this band Down" and give them a copy of the tape without telling the person that they were in the band.<ref name="Revolver">{{cite journal| author=Geist, Brandon |year=2007 |month=November |title=Never Say Die |journal=[[Revolver Magazine]] |accessdate=2008-02-27}}</ref><ref name="Stormbringer">{{cite web| url=http://www.stormbringerwebzine.co.uk/Interviews/Pepper_Keenan.htm |title=Interview with Pepper Keenan (Down and C.O.C.) |publisher=Stormbringerwebzine.co.uk |accessdate=2008-02-27}}</ref> Eventually, the tape was distributed throughout the United States and Down played a small concert in its hometown. A record executive from [[Elektra Records]] was attending the show to find out who the members of Down were. When he found out the members of the band, he signed Down to a recording contract.<ref name="Stormbringer"/>

Down released its debut album, ''[[NOLA (album)|NOLA]]'', on [[September 19]], [[1995]]. Debuting at number 55 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], the album has been certified platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]].<ref name="Revolver"/><ref name="Billboard">{{cite web| url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/retrieve_chart_history.do?model.chartFormatGroupName=Albums&model.vnuArtistId=141345&model.vnuAlbumId=174871 |title=Artist chart history |publisher=[[Billboard charts]] |accessdate=2008-02-28}}</ref> [[All Music Guide]] reviewer David Reamer gave the album a nearly perfect 4.5 out of 5 stars, praising the songs "Temptations Wings", "Stone the Crow", and "Bury Me in Smoke". Reamer stated "This is a landmark album that combines the talents of dedicated rock musicians, and should be included in any collection of heavy metal music."<ref>{{cite web| author=Reamer, David |url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&token=&sql=10:kpfixqehld6e |title=''NOLA'' overview |publisher=[[All Music Guide]] |accessdate=2008-02-27}}</ref> ''NOLA'' was supported by a 13 date tour, before the band entered a hiatus to return to their respective bands.<ref name="Revolver"/>

=== ''A Bustle in Your Hedgerow'' and ''Over the Under'' ===

In 1999, while Down was on hiatus, Strange left the band and was replaced by Pantera bassist [[Rex Brown]]. In 2002, Down came back from hiatus to make another record. The band wrote and recorded ''[[Down II: A Bustle in Your Hedgerow]]'' in 28 "drug and booze induced" days in a barn called "N<U+00F6>dferatu's lair".<ref name="Decibel">{{cite journal| author=Parks, Andrew |year=2007 |month=October |url=http://decibelmagazine.com/features/oct2007/down.aspx?terms=Over+the+Under&searchtype=2&fragment=True |title=Down |journal=[[Decibel Magazine]] |accessdate=2008-02-28}}</ref> The album was released on [[March 26]], [[2002]] and was not received with the positive reviews that appeared when ''NOLA'' was released. [[Blabbermouth.net]] reviewer Borivoj Krgin stated "''Down II'' appears to have been thrown together more haphazardly, with much of the material falling short of the standard set by the Down's classic debut offering."<ref>{{cite web| author=Krgin, Borivoj |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/showreview.aspx?reviewID=72 |title=CD reviews <U+2013> ''Down II'' |publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]] |accessdate=2008-02-28}}</ref> Despite poor reviews, the album debuted at number 44 on the ''Billboard'' 200.<ref name="Billboard"/> To support the album, Down toured on the second stage of [[Ozzfest]] in 2002.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://ozzfest.com/static_content/view/alumni.html |title=Ozzfest alumni |publisher=Ozzfest.com |accessdate=2008-02-28}}</ref> The band again entered an indefinite hiatus to focus on their respective bands.

Newly signed to [[Warner Bros. Records]], Down once again reformed in 2006. The band wrote an album throughout the course of a year. Lyric topics on ''[[Down III: Over the Under]]'' were written about many subjects such as the breakup of Pantera, the murder of ex-Pantera guitarist [[Dimebag Darrell]], and Anselmo's recovery from his back surgery and quiting drinking and drugs.<ref name="Revolver"/><ref name="Decibel"/> Debuting at number 26 on the ''Billboard'' 200, the album was released on [[September 25]], [[2007]] to generally positive reviews.<ref name="Billboard"/> Kirk Miller of ''[[Decibel Magazine]]'' stated "For almost an hour, it<U+2019>s like the metal world was set right again."<ref>{{cite web| author=Miller, Kirk |url=http://decibelmagazine.com/reviews/nov2007/down.aspx?terms=Over+the+Under&searchtype=2&fragment=True |title=''Down III: Over the Under'' |publisher=''Decibel Magazine'' |accessdate=2008-02-28}}</ref>

Down supported the album by touring with [[Heaven and Hell]] and [[Megadeth]], as well as performing on a headlining tour.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=65651 |title=Megadeth and Down to support Heaven and Hell in Canada |publisher=Blabbermouth.net |date=[[2007-01-20]] |accessdate=2008-02-28}}</ref> Down stated they will be re-releasing ''NOLA'' with Brown playing bass, as well as remastering the album along with ''Down II: A Bustle in Your Hedgerow'' in 2008.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.metalunderground.com/news/details.cfm?newsid=20514 |title=''Down III'' coming soon |publisher=Metalunderground.com |date=[[2007-07-20]] |accessdate=2008-02-28}}</ref>
