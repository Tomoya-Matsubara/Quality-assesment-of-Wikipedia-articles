==Style==
''Mylo Xyloto'' is  a [[concept album]], and its contents follows a story throughout. According to Chris Martin, the album is "based on a love story with a happy ending," in which two protagonists living in an oppressive, dystopian, urban environment, meet one another through a gang and fall in love. Lyrically, the album is inspired by "old school American [[graffiti]]" and "the [[White Rose]] Movement." Martin also said that the album was influenced by [[HBO]] TV series ''[[The Wire]]''.<ref name="autogenerated1">Dan DeLuca, ''Philadelphia Inquirer'' (24 May 2009) "Comedy, confidence, and Coldplay"</ref> Coldplay have stated on several occasions that they want their next studio album to be "more acoustic" and "more intimate" than its predecessor, 2008's ''[[Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends]]''.

==Release and promotion==
The album was set to be released in December 2010 as a "decade-ender", but was postponed to 2011 since the album was far from finished as Coldplay concluded their [[Viva la Vida Tour]]. Chris Martin and Jonny Buckland mentioned that the album would be released in the latter year.{{cn|date=December 2011}}

''Mylo Xyloto'' has received mixed-to-favourable reviews from music critics. According to critic review aggregator [[Metacritic]], the album has received a score of 65/100, based on 38 reviews, indicating generally favorable reviews.<ref name="mc">{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/music/mylo-xyloto/critic-reviews|title=Critic Reviews for Mylo Xyloto|work=[[Metacritic]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|accessdate=2011-10-24}}</ref> ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' rated the record 7/10, saying that like its predecessor, "''Mylo Xyloto'' draws from an expansive palette that makes Coldplay's first three albums sound even quainter". The reviewer noted that "where ''Viva La Vida'' showcased Coldplay's sense of adventure, this [album] feels more eager to please".<ref name="spin">{{cite web|url=http://www.spin.com/reviews/coldplay-mylo-xyloto-capitol

He did praise the electronic flourishes, saying that there was "deftness with which Coldplay weave the electronics around their sound" and it "genuinely adds a bit of freshness to a formulaic sound".<ref name="guardian">{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2011/oct/20/coldplay-mylo-xyloto-review?newsfeed=true|title=Coldplay: Mylo Xyloto&nbsp;<U+2013> review|work=[[The Guardian]]|first=Alexis|last=Petridis|date=2011-10-20|accessdate=2011-10-20|location=London}}</ref> Josh Eels of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' gave the album a score of three-and-a-half stars, calling it their most ambitious effort and saying that "the choruses are bigger, the textures grander, the optimism more optimistic.

She wrote that "it's strange to hear Martin insist that it's 'us against the world'", particularly "within the same kind of expansive, soaring guitar-pop that's so adored by the world they're supposedly bucking against". Maerz concluded, "The world doesn't seem sick of Coldplay, but maybe they're sick of themselves."<ref name="ew">{{cite journal|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20538072,00.html|title=Music Review: Mylo Xyloto|journal=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|first=Melissa|last=Maerz|date=2011-10-28|issue=1178|accessdate=2011-10-19}}</ref> [[IGN]] gave the album a score of 8/10, with [[IGN]] calling it an "epic record that will doubtless sell by the planet-load despite a ridiculous name". [[Sputnikmusic]] awarded the album 10/10, stating that "Mylo Xyloto proves that coldplay are quite simply the best pop/rock band in the world, bar none".

''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]'' awarded the record a maximum score of five stars, saying, "their fifth album will, at the bare minimum, safely sustain their imperial position for a long time to come". Martin was praised for his vocals and Buckland for "riffs [that] twinkle and flare like meteor showers", as were Eno and Dravs for "spar[ing] nothing here in the way of sonic stardust".
