Consisting of five direct parodies and seven original songs, ''"Weird Al" Yankovic'' parodies [[pop music|pop]] and [[rock music]] of the late 1970s and early 1980s, and satirizes American culture and experiences of the same time period.  The album, which was produced and engineered by [[Rick Derringer]] and Peter Kelsey respectively,<ref name="buy.com" /> received a lukewarm reception by critics and reviewers.

==Production==
[[File:Rick Derringer.jpg|thumb|upright|left|"Ace rock guitarist" Rick Derringer produced ''"Weird Al" Yankovic''. (1974, Jim Summaria)]]
After hearing Yankovic's parody of his song "[[I Love Rock 'n' Roll]]", songwriter [[Jake Hooker (musician)|Jake Hooker]] suggested to "ace rock guitarist" [[Rick Derringer]] that he would be the perfect producer for the burgeoning parodist.  Agreeing, Derringer used his music industry prestige and convinced [[Cherokee Studios]] to record an album's worth of Yankovic's songs gratis, to be paid from sales revenue.  Then, in March 1982, "Weird Al" Yankovic stepped into a professional recording studio for the first time and recorded nine of the songs for ''"Weird Al" Yankovic''.<ref name="praitb">{{cite album-notes

{{quotation|The huge irony of my life; [...] it was difficult for me to get signed to a record deal back in early 80s because all the executives were saying "Oh, you do that ...

You know, nobody'll ever hear from you again."|"Weird Al" Yankovic|speaking with Bob Boilen on ''[[All Songs Considered]]'' in 2006<ref name="20061102NPR" />}}

After encountering difficulty picking up a record label for the first-time album, Jay Levey (a Los Angeles artists' manager) provided [[KIQQ-FM]] with a copy of "I Love Rocky Road".  Impressing the program director of the [[Top 40]] station, he played it immediately; "I Love Rocky Road" was one of the most-requested songs by the next day.  At the same time, Tad Dowd<U+2014>head of the new record label, [[Rock 'n Roll Records]]<U+2014>had been trying to convince parent company [[Scotti Brothers Records]] to sign the 22-year-old Yankovic.  The positive furor over the KIQQ playtest provided Dowd with the leverage needed to convince Scotti Bros. to offer a contract for Yankovic's first album.<ref name="praitb" />

Scotti Brothers Records' contract planned an April 1983 release date for a twelve-track album: "I Love Rocky Road" and eight other tracks were already recorded, "[[Another One Rides the Bus]]" would be the original 1980 live recording from ''[[Dr. Demento|The Dr. Demento Show]]'', and the last two songs ("[[Ricky (song)|Ricky]]" and "Buckingham Blues") would be recorded at Scotti Brothers' own studios in [[Santa Monica, California]].<ref name="praitb" /><ref name="buy.com">{{cite web

===Promotion===
[[File:Dr Demento (flipped).jpg|thumb|Dr. Demento helped promote ''"Weird Al" Yankovic''. ({{start date|2004|08|15}}, David Rossi)]]
To promote the album, Levy coordinated a three-week tour in late Summer 1983 across the United States' [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] and [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] for both Yankovic and [[Dr. Demento]].  Promoted as "<!-- original CAPITALIZED quotation: AN EVENING OF DEMENTIA WITH DR. DEMENTO IN PERSON PLUS 'WEIRD AL' YANKOVIC -->An Evening of Dementia with Dr. Demento in Person Plus 'Weird Al' Yankovic", Demento opened with recorded hits and short comedy films from his show before introducing Yankovic and the band.  During their three weeks, the tour played in several famous clubs, including [[Bottom Line]] in [[New York City]].<ref name="praitb" />

==Critical reception==
{{Album ratings

}}
[[Eugene Chadbourne]], reviewer for [[allmusic]], felt that while ''"Weird Al" Yankovic'' was a detailed harbinger of parody to come, the album does not hold up well on its own.  Chadbourne extolled most of the parodies ("Another One Rides the Bus", "My Bologna", "I Love Rocky Road") for their comedic value in contrast with their originals<U+2014>songs he supposed to be "pretentious [&] overblown".  However, also according to Chadbourne, "Ricky" lacks the comedic connection Yankovic cultivates in later albums, and the original songs "may not seem like they were written in ten minutes, but the ideas behind them don't seem to involve that much contemplation.  [They're] like little bits of puff [whose ...] impact on the flow of an album side is more like ballast."<ref name="allmusic" />

Introducing Yankovic as the guest DJ for ''[[All Songs Considered]]'' on [[National Public Radio]] in 2006, host [[Bob Boilen]] opined that upon his debut, Yankovic "seemed the epitome of throw-away novelty act".<ref name="20061102NPR">{{cite web

His latest album, ''Straight Out Of Lynwood''{{sic}}, is his first to break the top-ten. On this edition of ''All Songs Considered'', Yankovic talks about his music and shares some of the songs that have inspired him over the years.

Reviewing Yankovic in 2008, Brian Raftery of [[Wired (magazine)|''Wired'' magazine]] wrote that "Ricky" introduced the world to "an accordion-playing spaz with a coif like [[Rick James]] and a voice like an urgent [[goose]]."  In 1983, Yankovic was considered a [[fad]] of the time<U+2014>comparing him to [[parachute pants]] and [[Contras]]<U+2014>and "thoroughly disposable."<ref name="20080922wired" />

* Yankovic's parody of [[The Kinks]]' song "[[Lola (song)|Lola]]"<U+2014>"[[Yoda (song)|Yoda]]"<U+2014>was written in 1980 (during the initial theatre run of ''[[Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back|The Empire Strikes Back]]''), and a "huge hit" on ''The Dr. Demento Show''.  However, the complexities of receiving permission from filmmaker [[George Lucas]] and the Kinks' publishers delayed its release until 1985.<ref name="praitb" />
