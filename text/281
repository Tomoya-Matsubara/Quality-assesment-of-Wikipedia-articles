"'''Makes Me Wonder'''" is the first [[single (music)|single]] released from [[Maroon 5]]'s second album, ''[[It Won't Be Soon Before Long]]'' (2007). It premiered on the [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] radio station [[KMXB]], and became an instant hit worldwide. Upon release, the song set a record for the biggest jump to number-one in the history of the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart, rising from number 64 to number-one. However, the record was later broken by [[Kelly Clarkson]]'s 2009 single, "[[My Life Would Suck Without You]]".

"Makes Me Wonder" also became the band's first number-one on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 chart. The song won the [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal]] at the [[50th Grammy Awards]], their second song to win the award. The song was among the most successful of [[2007 in music|2007]], and was their biggest hit until the release of "[[Moves Like Jagger]]" by the band in 2011.

Despite the song's commercial success, critical reception was mixed. It was ranked No. 49 on ''[[Rolling Stone]]''{{'}}s list of the 100 Best Songs of 2007. Maroon 5 performed the song in May 2007 on ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]''.

This song was used in ''[[Rock Band]]'' games as DLC.

==Background and writing==
[[File:Palms Casino Resort.jpg|thumb|Maroon 5 worked with producer Mark Endert for "Makes Me Wonder" at [[Studio at the Palms]] in Las Vegas.]]
Levine began writing parts of "Makes Me Wonder" years before its release in 2007. Maroon 5 recorded a [[demo (music)|demo]] of it, which was one of their firsts while on the "road". The band however put the track aside, and years later revisited it for ''Won't Be Soon Before Long''. Levine recalled that the song "kept coming up because the label loved it".<ref name="MossWonderClip">{{cite news|last=Moss|first=Corey|title=Maroon 5 Film 'Wonder' Clip; Say Next One Is Bob Dylan Meets R. Kelly|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1555064/maroon-5-shoot-video-at-fantasy-airport.jhtml|work=MTV News|accessdate=2007-05-16}}</ref> After taking a break from their previous studio sessions for ''Won't Be Soon Before Long'', which was intended to gain "perspective" with the tracks, Maroon 5 regrouped at Glenwood Place Studios in Burbank, California. There, they "rethought a couple of songs and we went back and recut about three songs".<ref name="FarinellaRight">{{cite web|last=Farinella|first=David John|title=Maroon 5: Taking Time To Get It Right|url=http://mixonline.com/recording/tracking/audio_maroon_2/|work=Mix Magazine|publisher=NewBay Media, LLC|accessdate=2012-02-06|date=2007-11-01}}</ref>

Reworking the song for their new album, Maroon 5 struggled to finish "Makes Me Wonder". The band could not formulate a chorus that would match with the rest of "Makes Me Wonder"'s music, which then had been around for four years.<ref name="FarinellaRight"/> At one point, it had the band deciding to venture into a songwriting trip to "somewhere without distractions".<ref name="MossWonderClip"/> While working on another song when they went to a Las Vegas studio, Maroon 5 came up with a part that would work "if they changed the chords".<ref name="FarinellaRight"/> Levine recalls, "It was actually great because we were distracted just enough that we didn't think about it too much, and then we wrote this part that wound up being the chorus."<ref name="MossWonderClip"/>

==Production and music==
Prior to "Makes Me Wonder", producer Mark Endert had contributed to the band's debut album, ''Songs About Jane'', in which he provided additional production to and mixed the hit single "[[This Love (Maroon 5 song)|This Love]]". Having worked on a song called "[[Wake Up Call (Maroon 5 song)|Wake Up Call]]" for the new album, Endert's involvement transitioned to "Makes Me Wonder". Maroon 5, having re-examined the song, asked Endert to assist them on a track which they did not like. To Endert, the band did not "feel like they had realized its potential". However, "They were open to new ideas, so I had the freedom to go and look for a new approach."<ref name="TingenEndert">{{cite web|last=Tingen|first=Paul|title=Secrets Of The Mix Engineers: Mark Endert|url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/sep07/articles/insidetrack_0907.htm|work=Sound on Sound|accessdate=2012-01-16}}</ref>

Working on the new material, Endert produced a [[mockup]] for the track's [[arrangement]], a process he normally does as a producer. Using his ''Logic'' system at Scream Studios, he programmed the keyboards, bass, guitars on an old '80s Roland. When done, Endert flew to Los Angeles to present to the band the track, to which they approved. Endert and the band went to the [[Sunset Sound Recorders|Sunset Sound]] studio where they added track and "replaced any parts in ''Logic'' that were considered band instruments", resulting to it sounding like Maroon 5's.<ref name="TingenEndert"/>

According to producer Mark Endert, the idea was to make the song's music contemporary and urban. Meanwhile, they wanted to render it classic by making references to '70s and early '80s sound.<ref name="TingenEndert"/> Its music changed from "a more rock 'n' roll feel to a '70s funk vibe".<ref name="FarinellaRight"/>

==Lyrical meaning==
"Makes Me Wonder" began as a love song which Levine wrote about a "failed relationships",<ref name="NewsPreaching">{{cite news|title=Politics without preaching|url=http://www.news.com.au/politics-without-preaching/story-e6frfn79-1111113447292|work=News.com.au|publisher=News Limited|accessdate=2007-05-01}}</ref> which he said went horribly wrong.<ref name="MossWonderClip"/> However, when he revisited the song for ''It Won't Be Soon Before Long'' a few years later, Levine "recognized a whole new dimension" to it which resulted to his adding political insights on the lyrics.<ref name="NewsPreaching"/>

[[File:USMarineTankinBaghdad.jpg|thumb|right|One meaning of "Makes Me Wonder" is about Levine's frustration at the state of politics and the United States' role in the [[war in Iraq]].]]

The lyrics of "Makes Me Wonder" have two different meanings. It contains political insinuations disguised as a love song because of Levine's not wanting to be preachy. It combines lyrics about his being in a state of a failed relationship and his "failure to understand or trust" the leadership of his country.<ref>{{cite news|last=Moss|first=Corey|title=Maroon 5 Back With 'Harder' Album After Adam Levine Gets Sick Of Partying|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1553993/maroon-5-come-back-with-harder-album.jhtml|accessdate=2012-01-20|newspaper=MTV News}}</ref>

One meaning is about Levine's frustration at the state of politics and the United States' role in the [[war in Iraq]]. From the original lyrics, they incorporated the line "Give me something to believe in / Because I don't believe in you anymore" which became the refrain to the chorus.<ref name="MossWonderClip"/> Levine revealed that the lyrics "maybe not targeted at the Bush administration, but maybe dancing around that territory a little bit".<ref name="MossWonderClip"/> "Makes Me Wonder" shows the band's confusion about the politics in the country.<ref name="NewsPreaching"/> Levine explains:

<blockquote>
I really wanted to write a political song, a song that reflected the way I felt about everything. It's one of the most difficult things in the world to do without coming off as a total arse and preachy - all the things that I hate about a lot of songwriting. So I didn't want to overtly say it. I just wanted to allude to it.<ref name="NewsPreaching"/>
</blockquote>

The second meaning is simply about [[love]]. The lyrics in the chorus reflects one of Levine's relationships that went horribly wrong. Levine states about their relationship, "It had something to do with our growing dissatisfaction with things and the confusion that was in the air."<ref name="MossWonderClip"/>

==Release and versions==
The song has two censored clean versions, the "super clean" and "clean" versions. The tracks are identical except the "super clean" version has the word "god damn" removed from the second verse and the word "fuck" is more clearly censored out. The "super clean" version was played at the [[Kids Choice Awards|2007 Kids Choice Awards]].

A kid-friendly version of "Makes Me Wonder" was covered by the [[Kidz Bop|Kidz Bop Kids]] on their album ''[[Kidz Bop 12]]''. Super producer [[Just Blaze]] did a remix to "Makes Me Wonder" that ended up becoming highly praised by many fans and was featured on ''[[Call and Response: The Remix Album]]''.

==Critical reception==
Stephen Thomas Erlewine of [[Allmusic]], discussing the identity of Maroon 5's music, noted that "Makes Me Wonder", even with its "flash[y] production", is not about its "feel" but the song itself that makes the album "work".<ref>{{cite web|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|title=It Won't Be Soon Before Long|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/r1067274/review|work=Allmusic|publisher=Rovi Corporation|accessdate=2012-01-21}}</ref> Ann Powers of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' called "Makes Me Wonder" an "aggravatingly danceable track".<ref>{{cite web|last=Powers|first=Ann|title="It Won't Be Soon Before Long" (A&M/Octone)|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/music/cl-et-maroon522,1,71646.story?coll=la-promo-entnews&ctrack=1&cset=true|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=2012-01-21}}</ref>

For Neil Drumming of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', Levine seems "detached ... cold even" in the song, adding that "there's a twisted logic to his dispassionate delivery".<ref>{{cite web|last=Drumming|first=Neil|title=It Won't Be Soon Before Long (2007)|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20038960,00.html|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=2007-05-18|publisher=Time, Inc|accessdate=2012-01-21}}</ref> Wrote Rosie Swash of ''[[The Guardian]]'', "'Makes Me Wonder' is so bland it's offensive."<ref>{{cite web|last=Swash|first=Rosie|title=All your friends will love LCD Soundsystem's latest more than Candie Payne's|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2007/may/15/singlesclub.news?INTCMP=SRCH|work=The Guardian|accessdate=2012-01-21|date=2007-05-15}}</ref> [[Robert Christgau]], in his review for ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', noted the "political subtext" of the song.<ref>{{cite web|last=Christgau|first=Robert|title=Can't Stop the Hustle|url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/rs/maroon5-07.php|publisher=robertchristgau.com|accessdate=2011-01-24}}</ref>

The band won their third [[Grammy Award]] for [[Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal]] for "Makes Me Wonder" at the 50th Anniversary show of the Grammys on February 10, 2008. It was their second win in this category after "[[This Love (Maroon 5 song)|This Love]]".

==Chart performance==

The song reached number 11 on the U.S. [[Adult Top 40]] after only two weeks on the chart, becoming only the third song since 2000 to reach the top 15 of the Adult Top 40 in two weeks or less.<ref name=Debut>Jonathan Cohen, [http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1052866/timbaland-soars-to-no-1-after-sales-explosion "Timbaland Soars To No. 1 After Sales Explosion"], Billboard.com, April 12, 2007.</ref>

==Music video==
[[File:LAX, 02.JPG|thumb|Maroon 5 shot the video of "Makes Me Wonder" at the [[Los Angeles International Airport]].]]

Directed by [[John Hillcoat]], the video was shot at the [[Los Angeles International Airport]] and at the [[Los Angeles Department of Transportation]]. Levine said Hillcoat had an idea of turning the airport into a bizarre, surreal, sexually charged, fashionable world. It was the band's first music video without former drummer Ryan Dusick, who had left the band the previous year, and it was the first music video to feature new drummer Matt Flynn.

The video premiered on [[MTV]]'s ''[[Total Request Live]]'' on March 29, 2007. In the video, the gate they are in is "M5", which stands for Maroon 5.
