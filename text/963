An '''unmanned aerial vehicle''' ('''UAV'''), commonly known as a '''drone''' and referred to as a '''Remotely Piloted Aircraft''' ('''RPA''') by the [[International Civil Aviation Organization]] (ICAO), is an [[aircraft]] without a human [[Aviator|pilot]] aboard. Its flight is controlled either autonomously by onboard computers or by the [[Remote control vehicle|remote control]] of a [[Aviator|pilot]] on the ground or in another vehicle. The typical launch and recovery method of an unmanned aircraft is by the function of an automatic system or an external operator on the ground.<ref name="af.mil">[http://archive.is/20120719164359/http://www.af.mil/news/story.asp?storyID=123208561 "Air Force officials announce remotely piloted aircraft pilot training pipeline"], ''www.af.mil'', June 9, 2010.</ref> Historically, UAVs were simple remotely piloted [[aircraft]], but autonomous control is increasingly being employed.<ref name="nytimes">{{cite news | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/19/world/asia/19pstan.html?_r=0 | newspaper = [[New York Times]] | author = Pir Zubair Shah| author-link = Pir Zubair Shah | title = Pakistan Says U.S. Drone Kills 13 | date = June 18, 2009}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=August 2013}}

They are usually deployed for [[military]] and [[special operation]] applications, but also used in a small but growing number of civil applications, such as [[policing]] and [[firefighting]], and nonmilitary security work, such as surveillance of pipelines.

{{Main|History of unmanned aerial vehicles}}
[[File:Teledyne-Ryan-Firebee-hatzerim-1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ryan Firebee]] was a series of [[target drone]]s/unmanned aerial vehicles.]]

The idea of a pilotless aircraft is not a new concept. The concept of drones dates back to the mid-1800s, when Austrians sent off unmanned, bomb-filled balloons as a way to attack Venice. The drone we see today started innovation in the early 1900s, and was originally used for target practice to train military personnel. It continued to be developed during World War I, when the Dayton-Wright Airplane Company came up with the a pilotless aerial torpedo that would drop and explode at a particular, preset time.<ref>{{cite web|last=Says|first=Robert Kanyike|title=History of U.S. Drones|url=http://understandingempire.wordpress.com/2-0-a-brief-history-of-u-s-drones/|accessdate=2014-02-17}}</ref>   
The earliest attempt at a powered unmanned aerial vehicle was [[Archibald Low|A. M. Low]]'s "Aerial Target" of 1916.<ref name="autogenerated1">Taylor, A. J. P. ''Jane's Book of Remotely Piloted Vehicles''.</ref> [[Nikola Tesla]] described a fleet of unmanned aerial combat vehicles in 1915.<ref name=armyeyes>Dempsey, Martin E.

Accessed: 6 March 2011.</ref> A number of remote-controlled airplane advances followed during and after [[World War I]], including the [[Hewitt-Sperry Automatic Airplane]]. The first scale RPV (Remote Piloted Vehicle) was developed by the film star and [[model airplane]] enthusiast [[Reginald Denny (actor)|Reginald Denny]] in 1935.<ref name="autogenerated1" /> More were made in the technology rush during [[World War II]]; these were used both to train antiaircraft gunners and to fly attack missions. [[Nazi Germany]] also produced and used various UAV aircraft during the course of WWII. [[Jet engine]]s were applied after World War II in such types as the  [[Ryan Aeronautical|Teledyne Ryan]] [[Ryan Firebee|Firebee I]] of 1951, while companies like [[Beechcraft]] also got in the game with their [[Model 1001]] for the [[United States Navy]] in 1955.<ref name="autogenerated1" /> Nevertheless, they were little more than remote-controlled airplanes until the [[Vietnam Era]].

The birth of U.S. UAVs (called RPVs at the time) began in 1959 when [[United States Air Force]] (USAF) officers, concerned about losing [[Aviator|pilots]] over hostile territory, began planning for the use of [[Unmanned Aircraft|unmanned]] flights.<ref>Wagner p. xi</ref> This plan became intensified when [[Francis Gary Powers]] and his "secret" [[Lockheed U-2|U-2]] were shot down over the [[Soviet Union]] in 1960. Within days, the highly [[classified information|classified]] UAV program was launched under the code name of "Red Wagon".<ref>Wagner p. xi, xii</ref> The August 2 and August 4, 1964, clash in the [[Tonkin Gulf Incident|Tonkin Gulf]] between naval units of the U.S. and North Vietnamese Navy initiated America's highly classified UAVs into their first combat missions of the [[Vietnam War]].<ref>Wagner p. xii</ref>  When the "Red Chinese"<ref>Wagner p. 79</ref> showed photographs of downed U.S. UAVs via ''Wide World Photos'',<ref>Wagner p. 78 & 79 photos</ref> the official U.S. response was "no comment."

There are two prominent UAV programs within the United States: that of the military and that of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA). The military<U+2019>s UAV program is overt, meaning that the public recognizes which government operates it and, therefore, it only operates where US troops are stationed. The CIA<U+2019>s program is clandestine. Missions performed by the CIA<U+2019>s UAV program do not always occur where US troops are stationed.<ref>{{cite web|last=Mayer|title=The Predator War|url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2009/10/26/091026fa_fact_mayer|accessdate=2009}}</ref>

The CIA<U+2019>s UAV program was commissioned as a result of the [[September 11 attacks|September 11 terrorist attacks]] and the increasing emphasis on operations for intelligence gathering in 2004.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Radsan|first=AJ|author2=Murphy|title=Measure Twice, Shoot Once: Higher Care for Cia-Targeted Killing|journal=Univ.

This program constructed the CIA<U+2019>s first using <U+201C>off the shelf technology,<U+201D> which included items such as garage door openers and model airplanes.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}

Only on February 26, 1973, during testimony before the [[United States House Committee on Appropriations]], the U.S. military officially confirmed that they had been utilizing UAVs in [[Southeast Asia]] (Vietnam).<ref>Wagner p. 202</ref>  Over 5,000 U.S. airmen had been killed and over 1,000 more were either missing in action ([[Missing In Action|MIA]]) or captured (prisoners of war/[[POW]]). The USAF [[100th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing]] had flown approximately 3,435 UAV missions during the war<ref>Wagner p. 200 & 212</ref> at a cost of about 554 UAVs lost to all causes. In the words of USAF [[General]] [[George S. Brown]], Commander, [[Air Force Systems Command]], in 1972, "The only reason we need (UAVs) is that we don't want to needlessly expend the man in the cockpit."<ref name="Wagner p. 208">Wagner p. 208</ref>  Later that same year, General [[John C. Meyer]], Commander in Chief, [[Strategic Air Command]], stated, "we let the drone do the high-risk flying&nbsp;... the loss rate is high, but we are willing to risk more of them&nbsp;... ''they save lives!"<ref name="Wagner p. 208"/>

During the 1973 [[Yom Kippur War]], Soviet-supplied surface-to-air missile batteries in Egypt and Syria caused heavy damage to Israeli [[fighter jet]]s. As a result, Israel developed the first UAV with real-time surveillance.<ref>{{cite web

With the maturing and miniaturization of applicable technologies as seen in the 1980s and 1990s, interest in UAVs grew within the higher echelons of the U.S. military. In the 1990s, the U.S. Department of Defense gave a contract to U.S. corporation [[AAI Corporation]] of [[Maryland]] along with Israeli company Mazlat. The U.S. Navy bought the AAI Pioneer UAV that was jointly developed by American AAI Corporation and Israeli Mazlat, and this type of UAV is still in use. Many of these Pioneer and newly developed U.S. UAVs were used in the 1991 Gulf War. UAVs were seen to offer the possibility of cheaper, more capable fighting machines that could be used without risk to aircrews. Initial generations were primarily [[surveillance aircraft]], but some were armed, such as the [[General Atomics MQ-1 Predator]], which utilized [[AGM-114 Hellfire]] [[air-to-ground missile]]s. An armed UAV is known as an  [[unmanned combat air vehicle]] (UCAV).

As a tool for [[search and rescue]], UAVs can help find humans lost in the wilderness, trapped in collapsed buildings, or adrift at sea.

In February 2013, it was reported that UAVs were used by at least 50 countries, several of which made their own: for example, Iran, Israel and [[China]].<ref name = NatGeo/>

As of 2008, the United States Air Force employed 5,331 UAVs, which is twice its number of manned planes.<ref name="Singer" /> Out of these, the [[MQ-1 Predator|Predator]]s are the most commendable. Unlike other UAVs, the Predator was armed with [[Hellfire missiles]] so that it can terminate the target that it locates (Carafano & Gudgel, 2007). This was done after Predators sighted [[Osama Bin Laden]] multiple times but could not do anything about it other than send back images. In addition, the [[Predator]] is capable of orchestrating attacks by pointing lasers at the targets (Singer, 2009b). This is important, as it puts a robot in a position to set off an attack. Their overall success is apparent because from June 2005 to June 2006 alone, Predators carried out 2,073 missions and participated in 242 separate raids (Singer, 2009a).

In contrast to the [[MQ-1 Predator|Predator]], which is remotely piloted via satellites by pilots located 7,500 miles away, the [[Global Hawk]] operates virtually autonomously.<ref name="Singer" /> The user merely hits the button for <U+2018>take off<U+2019> and for <U+2018>land<U+2019>, while the UAV gets directions via GPS and reports back with a live feed. Global Hawks have the capability to fly from San Francisco and map out the entire state of Maine before having to return.<ref name="Singer" /> In addition, some UAVs have become so small that they can be launched from one<U+2019>s hand and maneuvered through the street.<ref name="Singer" /> These UAVs, known as [[RQ-11 Raven|Raven]]s, are especially useful in urban areas, such as Iraq, in order to discover insurgents and potential ambushes the next block up (Carafano & Gudgel, 2007). UAVs are especially useful because they can fly for days at a time. According to Carafano & Gudgel, insurgents are loathe to stay in the open for more than a few minutes at a time for fear of UAVs locating them (2007)

==FAA designation and legal regulation {{anchor|UAS}}==

In the United States, the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] has adopted the name ''unmanned aircraft'' (UA) to describe aircraft systems without a flight crew on board.<ref name="FAA summary" /> More common names include ''UAV'', ''drone'', ''remotely piloted vehicle'' (''RPV''), ''remotely piloted aircraft'' (''RPA''), and ''remotely operated aircraft'' (''ROA''). These "limited-size" (as defined by the ''[[F<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ration A<U+00E9>ronautique Internationale]]'') unmanned aircraft flown in the USA's [[National Airspace System]], flown solely for recreation and sport purposes, such as models, are generally{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} flown under the voluntary safety standards of the [[Academy of Model Aeronautics]],<ref>[http://www.modelaircraft.org/files/105.pdf Model "Academy of Model Aeronautics National Model Aircraft Safety Code"] (January 1, 2014 aircraft.org</ref> the United States' national aeromodeling organization.  To operate a UA for non-recreational purposes in the United States, according to the FAA users must obtain a ''Certificate of Authorization'' (COA) to operate in national airspace.<ref name="FAA: Certificate of Authorization or Waiver (COA)">{{cite web|title=FAA: Certificate of Authorization or Waiver (COA)|url=http://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/ato/service_units/systemops/aaim/organizations/uas/coa/}}</ref>  At the moment, COAs require a public entity as a sponsor. For example, when BP needed to observe oil spills, they operated the [[Aeryon Scout]] UAVs under a COA granted to the University of Alaska Fairbanks.<ref name="Unmanned aircraft to assist oil spill response">{{cite web|title=Unmanned aircraft to assist oil spill response|url=http://www.aeryon.com/news/pressreleases/256-uafbpjuly2011.html}}</ref>  COAs have been granted for both land and shipborne operations.<ref name="Shipborne CoA">{{cite web|title=Aeryon Scout<U+2122> Micro-UAV Provides Aerial Perspective for Ship-Based Wildlife Research Project in Bering Sea|url=http://www.aeryon.com/news/pressreleases/347-aeryon-scout-sealions-2012.html}}</ref>

The [[FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012]]<ref>http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CRPT-112hrpt381/pdf/CRPT-112hrpt381.pdf</ref> sets a deadline of September 30, 2015, for the agency to establish regulations to allow the use of commercial drones.  In the meantime, the agency claims it is illegal to operate commercial unmanned aerial vehicles, but approves non-commercial flights under 400 feet if they follow Advisory Circular 91-57, Model Aircraft Operating Standards, published in 1981.<ref name="FAA summary">[http://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/uas/reg/media/frnotice_uas.pdf Unmanned Aircraft Operations in the National Airspace System]</ref>  However, the FAA's attempt to fine a commercial drone operator for a 2011 flight were thrown out on 6 March 2014 by NTSB judge Patrick Geraghty, who found that the FAA had not followed the proper rulemaking procedures and therefore had no UAV regulations.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.politico.com/story/2014/03/faa-small-drones-ban-104393.html |title=Judge strikes down small drones ban |last1=Robillard |first1=Kevin |date=6 March 2014 |website=www.politico.com |publisher=Politico LLC |accessdate=6 March 2014}}</ref> The FAA will appeal the judgement.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/03/07/us-usa-aircraft-drones-idUSBREA261PY20140307 |title=U.S. FAA will appeal ruling on commercial drone use |last1=Krasny |first1=Ros |last2=Maler |first2=Sandra |date=7 March 2014 |website=www.reuters.com |publisher=Thomson Reuters |accessdate=7 March 2014}}</ref> Texas EquuSearch, which performs volunteer search and rescue operations, was also challenging FAA rules in 2014.<ref>http://amablog.modelaircraft.org/amagov/2014/04/21/texas-equusearch-requests-faa-to-reverse-its-ban-on-uas-search-rescue-operations/</ref>

The agency expects that five years after it unveils a regulatory framework for UASs weighing 55 pounds or less, there will be 7,500 such devices in the air.<ref name=WashPost20130816/>  In December 2013, the FAA announced six operators it was authorizing to conduct research on drone technology, to inform its pending regulations and future developments.  These were the [[University of Alaska]] (including locations in Hawaii and Oregon), the state of [[Nevada]], [[Griffiss International Airport]] in New York State, the [[North Dakota Department of Commerce]], [[Texas A&M University<U+2013>Corpus Christi]], and [[Virginia Tech]]<ref>[http://www.faa.gov/news/updates/?newsId=75399 FAA Selects Six Sites for Unmanned Aircraft Research]</ref>

In May, 2014, a group of major news media companies filed an ''[[Amicus curiae|amicus]]'' brief in a case before the U.S.'s [[National Transportation Safety Board]], asserting that the [[Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]]'s "overly broad" administrative limitations against private UAS operations cause an "impermissible chilling effect on the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] newsgathering rights of journalists", the brief being filed three months before a scheduled rollout of FAA commercial operator regulations.<ref name=WashPost20140507>{{cite news|last=Fung|first=Brian|title=Major news outlets call the FAA<U+2019>s drone restrictions a violation of the First Amendment|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2014/05/07/major-news-outlets-call-the-faas-drone-restrictions-a-violation-of-the-first-amendment/?wprss=rss_technology|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=May 7, 2014|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6PQ8zvSdm|archivedate=May 8, 2014 |deadurl=no}} ''FAA v.

The term '''unmanned aircraft system''' ('''UAS''') emphasizes the importance of other elements beyond an aircraft itself. A typical UAS consists of the following:
* unmanned aircraft (UA);
* control system, such as [[Ground Control Station]] (GCS);
* control link, a specialized [[datalink]]; and
* other related support equipment.

For example, the [[RQ-7 Shadow]] UAS consists of four UAs, two GCSs, one portable GCS, one Launcher, two Ground Data Terminals (GDTs), one portable GDT, and one Remote Video Terminal. Certain military units are also fielded with a maintenance support vehicle.

Because of this systemic approach, unmanned aircraft systems have not been included in the United States Munitions List Category VIII&nbsp;<U+2013> Aircraft and Associated Equipment. Vice versa, the <U+201C>Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Systems<U+201D> are clearly mentioned at paragraph 121-16 Missile Technology Control Regime Annex of the United States Munitions List. More precisely, the Missile Technology Control Regime Annex levels rocket and unmanned aerial vehicle systems together.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

The term UAS was since adopted by the [[United States Department of Defense]] (DOD) and the British [[Civil Aviation Authority (United Kingdom)|Civil Aviation Authority]] (CAA).

The term used previously for unmanned aircraft system was unmanned-aircraft vehicle system (UAVS).

The United States military employs a [[U.S. Military UAV tier system|tier system]] for categorizing its UAVs.

===Classifications by the United States military===
The modern concept of U.S. military UAVs is to have the various aircraft systems work together in support of personnel on the ground. The integration scheme is described in terms of a "Tier" system and is used by military planners to designate the various individual aircraft elements in an overall usage plan for integrated operations. The Tiers do not refer to specific models of aircraft but rather roles for which various models and their manufacturers competed. The [[U.S. Air Force]] and the [[U.S. Marine Corps]] each has its own tier system, and the two systems are themselves not integrated.

The first Marine Shadow systems have already been delivered, and training for their respective Marine Corps units is underway.<ref>[https://www.mccdc.usmc.mil/OpsDiv/CEAB/Jun%2005%20CEAB/JUN%2005%20Briefs/20%20-%20Coordinated%20UAV%20Endorsement%20Brief.ppt#5 USMC powerpoint presentation of tier system]</ref><ref>[http://www.navyleague.org/sea_power/jul06-18.php Detailed description of USMC tier system]</ref>

====U.S. Army tiers====
* Tier I: Small UAV. Role filled by the [[AeroVironment RQ-11 Raven|RQ-11B Raven]].
* Tier II: Short Range Tactical UAV. Role filled by the [[AAI RQ-7 Shadow|RQ-7B Shadow 200]].
* Tier III: Medium Range Tactical UAV. Role currently filled by the [[IAI RQ-5 Hunter|MQ-5A/B Hunter]] and IGNAT/IGNAT-ER, but transitioning to the Extended Range Multi-Purpose (ERMP) [[General Atomics MQ-1C Grey Eagle|MQ-1C Gray Eagle]].

====Future Combat Systems (FCS) (U.S. Army) classes====
* Class I: For small units. Role to be filled by all new UAV with some similarity to [[micro air vehicle]].
* Class II: For companies (cancelled).<ref name="watch">[http://www.defensetech.org/archives/cat_fcs_watch.html]{{dead link|date=March 2012}}</ref>
* Class III: For battalions (cancelled).<ref name="watch" />
* Class IV: For brigades. Role to be filled by the [[MQ-8 Fire Scout|RQ-8A/B / MQ-8B Fire Scout]].

====Unmanned aircraft system====
An unmanned aircraft system (UAS) includes ground stations and other elements besides the actual aircraft. The term was first officially used by the FAA in early 2005 and subsequently adopted by DoD that same year in their Unmanned Aircraft System Roadmap 2005<U+2013>2030.<ref>[http://www.acq.osd.mil/usd/Roadmap%20Final2.pdf#search=%22Dod%20UAS%20Roadmap%202005%22]{{dead link|date=March 2012}}</ref>  Many people have mistakenly used the term Unmanned ''Aerial'' System or Unmanned  ''Air Vehicle'' System, as these designations were in provisional use at one time or another.  The inclusion of the term [[aircraft]] emphasizes that regardless of the location of the pilot and flightcrew, the operations must comply with the same regulations and procedures as do those aircraft with the pilot and flightcrew on board.  The official acronym ''UAS'' is also used by the [[International Civil Aviation Organization]] (ICAO) and other government aviation regulatory organizations.

[[File:Predator and Hellfire.jpg|thumb|left|[[General Atomics MQ-1 Predator|Predator]] launching a Hellfire missile]]
The military role of unmanned aircraft systems is growing at unprecedented rates. In 2005, tactical- and theater-level unmanned aircraft alone had flown over 100,000 flight hours in support of [[Operation Enduring Freedom]] and [[Operation Iraqi Freedom]], in which they are organized under [[Task Force Liberty]] in Afghanistan and [[Task Force ODIN]] in Iraq. Rapid advances in technology are enabling more and more capability to be placed on smaller airframes, which is spurring a large increase in the number of Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems (SUAS) being deployed on the battlefield. The use of SUAS in combat is so new that no formal DoD wide reporting procedures have been established to track SUAS flight hours. As the capabilities grow for all types of UAS, nations continue to subsidize their research and development, leading to further advances and enabling them to perform a multitude of missions. UAS no longer only perform intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions, although this still remains their predominant type. Their roles have expanded to areas including [[electronic attack]], strike missions, [[suppression of enemy air defenses|suppression]] or destruction of enemy air defense, network node or communications relay, [[search and rescue|combat search and rescue]], and derivations of these themes. These UAS range in cost from a few thousand dollars to tens of millions of dollars, with aircraft ranging from less than one pound to over 40,000 pounds.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}

When the Obama administration announced in December 2009 the deployment of 30,000 new troops in Afghanistan, there was already an increase of attacks by unmanned Predator UAVs against Taliban and al-Qaeda militants in Afghanistan and [[Federally Administered Tribal Areas|Pakistan's tribal areas]], of which one probably killed a key member of al-Qaeda. However, neither [[Osama bin Laden]] nor [[Ayman al-Zawahiri]] was the likely target, according to reports. According to a report of the [[New America Foundation]], armed UAV strikes had dramatically increased under President Obama&nbsp;<U+2013> even before his deployment decision. There were 43 such attacks between January and October 2009. The report draws on what it deems to be ''"credible"'' local and national media stories about the attacks. This can be compared to a total of 34 in all of 2008, which was President Bush's last full year in office. Between 2006 and 2009, UAV-launched missiles allegedly had killed between 750 and 1,000 people in Pakistan, according to the report. Of these, about 20 people were said to be leaders of al-Qaeda, Taliban, and associated groups. Overall, 66% to 68% of the people killed were militants, and 31% to 33% were civilians. U.S. officials disputed the percentage for civilians.<ref>[http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Military/2009/1211/Drone-aircraft-in-a-stepped-up-war-in-Afghanistan-and-Pakistan "Drone aircraft in a stepped-up war in Afghanistan and Pakistan"], Iran design uav engine WWW.UAV.IR</ref> The U.S. Air Force has recently begun referring at least to larger UAS like Predator, Reaper, and Global Hawk as Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) to highlight the fact that these systems are always controlled by a human operator at some location.

However, artificial intelligence is advancing to the point where the aircraft are easily capable of taking off, landing, and flying themselves.  Then they simply have to be instructed as to their mission.  The military distinguishes between "man ''in'' the loop"(piloted) and "man ''on'' the loop" (supervised) systems, with "fully autonomous" (issued orders) growing organically from the second into a third category.  A.I. systems have been capable of making decisions and planning sequences of actions for decades; as of 2013, few fully autonomous systems have been constructed, but this is more a matter of convenience and technical implementation than of any fundamental barrier.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}

To distinguish UAVs from ''missiles'', a UAV is defined as a "powered, aerial vehicle that does not carry a human operator, uses aerodynamic forces to provide vehicle lift, can fly autonomously or be piloted remotely, can be expendable or recoverable, and can carry a lethal or nonlethal payload".<ref>[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Unmanned+Aerial+Vehicle The Free Dictionary], accessed 19 November 2010</ref> Therefore, [[cruise missile]]s are not considered UAVs because, like many other guided missiles, the vehicle itself is a weapon that is not reused, even though it is also unmanned and in some cases remotely guided.

As of January 2014, the U.S. military operates a large number of unmanned aerial systems: 7,362 [[RQ-11 Raven]]s; 990 [[AeroVironment Wasp III]]s; 1,137 [[AeroVironment RQ-20 Puma]]s; and 306 [[RQ-16 T-Hawk]] small UAS systems and 246 [[MQ-1 Predator]]s and [[MQ-1C Grey Eagle]]s; 126 [[MQ-9 Reaper]]s; 491 [[RQ-7 Shadow]]s; and 33 [[RQ-4 Global Hawk]] large systems.<ref>[http://www.dodbuzz.com/2014/01/02/pentagon-plans-for-cuts-to-drone-budgets/ Pentagon Plans for Cuts to Drone Budgets] - DoDBuzz.com, 2 January 2014</ref>

===Remote sensing===

UAV remote sensing functions include [[electromagnetic spectrum]] sensors, gamma ray sensors, biological sensors, and chemical sensors.  A UAV's [[electromagnetic sensor]]s typically include [[visual spectrum]], [[infrared]], or [[near infrared]] cameras as well as radar systems. Other electromagnetic wave detectors such as microwave and ultraviolet spectrum sensors may also be used but are uncommon. Biological sensors are sensors capable of detecting the airborne presence of various microorganisms and other biological factors.  [[Chemical sensors]] use [[Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy|laser spectroscopy]] to analyze the concentrations of each [[Chemical element|element]] in the air.

===Commercial aerial surveillance===

Aerial surveillance of large areas is made possible with low cost UAV systems. Surveillance applications include livestock monitoring, wildfire mapping, pipeline security, home security, road patrol, and anti-piracy.  The trend for the use of UAV technology in commercial aerial surveillance is expanding rapidly with increased development of automated object detection approaches.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Gaszczak|first=A|author2=T.P.

===Commercial and motion picture filmmaking===

In both Europe and the United States, UAV videography is a legal gray area. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and their European equivalents have not issued formal regulations and guidelines surrounding drones in the private sector. Much like how the explosive growth of crowdfunding sites like Kickstarter and Indiegogo has caused headaches for legislators, UAV technology has advanced too quickly for bureaucrats to handle.

The FAA is debating offering guidelines for drone operators in the private sector by 2015, and European regulators are meeting on February 9 to iron out rules for UAVs in EU airspace. Domestically, lobbyists are petitioning the agency to give wide leeway to the use of unmanned aircraft for commercial photography, videography, and surveillance purposes. At the same time, lobbyists for occupations that stand to lose business to drones such as commercial pilots are petitioning the FAA to restrict drone use as well.

Colin Guinn of DJI Innovations, a Texas-based retail UAV manufacturer, told Co.Create that FAA regulations generally permit hobbyist drone use when they are flown below 400 feet, and within the UAV operator<U+2019>s line of sight. For commercial drone camerawork inside the United States, industry sources told us that use is largely at the de facto consent <U+2013> or benign neglect <U+2013> of local law enforcement. Use of UAVs for filmmaking is generally easier on large private lots or in rural and exurban areas with fewer space concerns. In certain localities such as Los Angeles and New York, authorities have actively interceded to shut down drone filmmaking efforts due to concerns driven by safety or terrorism.<ref name="SS1">{{cite web| last=Ungerleider|first=Neal| title=See What You Can Do With Drone Filmmaking |url=

On 2 June 2014, the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) said it had received a petition from the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] seeking approval for the use of drones in video and filmmaking. Low-cost drones could be used for shots that would otherwise require a helicopter or a manned aircraft, which would reduce costs argued seven companies behind the petition. Drones are already used by movie makers and media in other parts of the world. The FAA is required by [[United States Congress|Congress]] to come up with rules for commercial use of drones by 2015.<ref name="DronesMovies">{{cite news|title=Seven movie makers seek permission to use drone for shooting |url=http://www.losangelesherald.com/index.php/sid/222543459/scat/3a8a80d6f705f8cc/ht/Seven-movie-makers-seek-permission-to-use-drone-for-shooting|accessdate=4 June 2014|publisher=''Los Angeles Herald''}}</ref>

===Sports===
Drones are starting to be used in sports photography and cinematography. For example, they were used in the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi for filming skiing and snowboarding events. Some advantages of using unmanned aerial vehicles in sports are that they allow video to get closer to the athletes, they are more flexible than cable-suspended camera systems.<ref>{{cite web|last=Feltman|first=Rachel|title=The Future of Sports Photography: Drones|url=http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/02/the-future-of-sports-photography-drones/283896/|publisher=The Atlantic|accessdate=04/2/2014}}</ref>

;First drone-assisted arrest of an American

On January 28, 2014, a North Dakota cattle rancher was sentenced to three years in prison, with all but six months suspended, for terrorizing police officers who were trying to arrest him at his property in 2011. The case garnered national attention because it was the first time a law-enforcement agency had used an unmanned aerial vehicle to assist in carrying out an arrest. The Predator drone was from the Department of Homeland Security's Customs and Border Patrol.<ref>{{cite web|author=Jason Koebler |url=http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2014/01/15/north-dakota-man-sentenced-to-jail-in-controversial-drone-arrest-case |title=North Dakota Man Sentenced to Jail In Controversial Drone-Arrest Case |publisher=US News |accessdate=2014-02-06}}</ref>

===Oil, gas and mineral exploration and production===

UAVs can be used to perform geophysical surveys, in particular geomagnetic surveys<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.universalwing.com/technology/our-uav |title=Our UAV |publisher=Universal Wing |date=2005-07-28 |accessdate=2012-03-31}}{{dead link|date=September 2013}}</ref> where the processed measurements of the Earth's differential magnetic field strength are used to calculate the nature of the underlying magnetic rock structure. A knowledge of the underlying rock structure helps trained geophysicists to predict the location of mineral deposits. The production side of oil and gas exploration and production entails the monitoring of the integrity of oil and gas pipelines and related installations. For above-ground pipelines, this monitoring activity could be performed using digital cameras mounted on one or more UAVs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.barnardmicrosystems.com/about/papers_&_presentations.html |title=InView papers and presentations |publisher=Barnardmicrosystems.com |accessdate=2012-03-31}}</ref> The [[InView Unmanned Aircraft System|InView UAV]] is an example of a UAV developed for use in oil, gas, and mineral exploration and production activities.

===Scientific research===

Unmanned aircraft are especially useful in penetrating areas that may be too dangerous for manned aircraft. The [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA) began utilizing the [[Insitu Aerosonde|Aerosonde]] unmanned aircraft system in 2006 as a [[hurricane]] hunter. AAI Corporation subsidiary [[Aerosonde Ltd|Aerosonde Pty Ltd]]. of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], Australia, designs and manufactures the 35-pound system, which can fly into a hurricane and communicate near-real-time data directly to the [[National Hurricane Center]] in [[Florida]]. Beyond the standard barometric pressure and temperature data typically culled from manned hurricane hunters, the Aerosonde system provides measurements far closer to the water<U+2019>s surface than previously captured. NASA later began using the [[Northrop Grumman RQ-4 Global Hawk]] for extended hurricane measurements.

Further applications for unmanned aircraft can be explored once solutions have been developed for their accommodation within national airspace, an issue currently under discussion by the [[Federal Aviation Administration]]. UAVSI, the UK manufacturer, also produces a variant of their Vigilant light UAS (20&nbsp;kg) designed specifically for scientific research in severe climates, such as the Antarctic.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}

There have also been experiments with using UAVs as a construction and artwork tool<ref>For a couple of examples, see the videos {{YouTube|W18Z3UnnS_0|''Construction with Quadrotor Teams''}} and {{YouTube|TI760jcFV2s|''Flying Robots Build a 6-Meter Tower''}}</ref> at locations such as the ETH Zurich.<ref>[http://www.zeitnews.org/node/3210 Flying Robots Build a 6-Meter Tower | ZeitNews]</ref>

===Armed attacks===
{{See also|Targeted killing|Unmanned combat air vehicle|Drone attacks in Pakistan}}
[[MQ-1 Predator]] UAVs armed with [[AGM-114 Hellfire|Hellfire missiles]] are increasingly used by the U.S. as platforms for hitting ground targets. Armed Predators were first used in late 2001 from bases in [[Pakistan]] and [[Uzbekistan]], mostly aimed at assassinating high profile individuals (terrorist leaders, etc.) inside Afghanistan. Since then, there have been many reported cases of such attacks taking place in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Yemen, and Somalia.<ref name="SauerSchoernigKillerDrones">Sauer, Frank/Schoernig Niklas, 2012: Killer drones: The <U+2018>silver bullet<U+2019> of democratic warfare?, in: Security Dialogue 43 (4): 363<U+2013>380, http://sdi.sagepub.com/content/43/4/363.abstract, last accessed September 1, 2012.</ref>  The advantage of using an unmanned vehicle rather than a manned aircraft in such cases is to avoid a diplomatic embarrassment should the aircraft be shot down and the pilots captured, since the bombings take place in countries deemed friendly and without the official permission of those countries.<ref>[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,177709,00.html Fox News]</ref><ref>[http://www.defenseindustrydaily.com/predator-kills-important-alqaeda-leader-in-pakistan-0547/ Defense Industry Daily]</ref><ref>[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7847008/ MSNBC]</ref><ref>[http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20080131.walq0131/BNStory/International/homeThe Globe and Mail]{{dead link|date=September 2013}}</ref>

According to the February 24, 2010 policy analysis "The Year of the Drone" released by the [[New America Foundation]], the civilian fatality rate since 2004 is approximately 32%. The study reports that 114 reported UAV-based missile strikes in northwest Pakistan from 2004 to present killed between 830 and 1,210 individuals, around 550 to 850 of whom were militants.<ref>{{cite web |author=Peter Bergen and Katherine Tiedemann |publisher=New America Foundation |title=2004<U+2013>2011 |accessdate=2011-09-10 |url=http://counterterrorism.newamerica.net/drones}}{{dead link|date=September 2013}}</ref>

After more than 30 UAV-based strikes hit civilian homes in Afghanistan in 2012, President [[Hamid Karzai]] demanded that such attacks end, but the practice continues in areas of Pakistan, Yemen, and Somalia that are not in war zones. Former U.S. President [[Jimmy Carter]] has criticized such use of UAVs: "We don't know how many hundreds of innocent civilians have been killed in these attacks...This would have been unthinkable in previous times."<ref>{{cite news|last=Carter|first=Jimmy|title=A Cruel and Unusual Record|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/25/opinion/americas-shameful-human-rights-record.html?_r=1|newspaper=New York Times|date=June 24, 2012}}</ref>

In October 2013, the Pakistani government revealed that since 2008, civilian casualties made up only 3 percent of deaths from drone strikes.  Since 2008, there have been 317 drone strikes that killed 2,160 Islamic militants and 67 civilians.  This is far less than previous government and independent organization calculations of collateral damage from these attacks.<ref>[http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2013/10/31/pakistan-done-deaths/3322539/ Pakistan says 3% of drone deaths civilians] - USAtoday.com, 31 October 2013</ref>

An attack by the US in December 2013, in a wedding procession in Yemen, killed 12 men and wounded at least 15 other people, including the bride. US and Yemeni officials said the dead were members of the armed group Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), but witnesses and relatives told Human Rights Watch the casualties were civilians. Witnesses and relatives told Human Rights Watch that no members of AQAP were in the procession and provided names and other information about those killed and wounded. They said the dead included the groom<U+2019>s adult son and the bride received superficial face wounds. The local governor and military commander called the casualties a <U+201C>mistake<U+201D> and gave money and assault rifles to the families of those killed and wounded <U+2013> a traditional gesture of apology in Yemen. A few days after the incident, Yemeni MPs voted for a ban against the use of drones in Yemen, though it is unclear what effect this will have on drone usage.<ref>{{cite web|title=US: Yemen Drone Strike May Violate Obama Policy|url=http://www.hrw.org/news/2014/02/19/us-yemen-drone-strike-may-violate-obama-policy|publisher=Human Rights Watch}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=The Aftermath of Drone Strikes on a Wedding Convoy in Yemen|url=http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/12/19/the-aftermath-of-drone-strikes-on-a-wedding-convoy-in-yemen/|newspaper=The New York Times}}</ref>

===Aerial target practice in training of human pilots===

===Search and rescue===
UAVs will likely play an increased role in search and rescue in the United States. This was demonstrated by the use of UAVs during the 2008 hurricanes that struck Louisiana and Texas. Micro UAVs, such as the [[Aeryon Scout]], have been used to perform Search and Rescue activities on a smaller scale, such as the search for missing persons.<ref name=police_using_drone_in_sar>{{cite web|title=Police use drone helicopter in search|url=http://www.aeryon.com/news/inthenews/314-2012policesearch.html}}</ref> For example, Predators, operating between 18,000<U+2013>29,000 feet above sea level, performed search and rescue and damage assessment. Payloads carried were an optical sensor, which is a daytime and [[infra red|infrared]] camera in particular, and a [[synthetic aperture radar]] (SAR). The Predator's SAR is a sophisticated all-weather sensor capable of providing photographic-like images through clouds, rain or fog, and in daytime or nighttime conditions, all in real-time. A concept of coherent change detection in SAR images allows for exceptional search and rescue ability: photos taken before and after the storm hits are compared, and a computer highlights areas of damage.<ref>[http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/ap/tx/5986181.html AP Texas News]{{dead link|date=March 2012}}</ref><ref>[http://www.justaeroworks.com/pages/JAW.08SRM.html 2008 Search and Rescue Missions]{{dead link|date=March 2012}}</ref>

===Archaeology===

In Peru archaeologists use drones to speed up survey work and protect sites from squatters, builders and miners.

Drones have replaced expensive and clumsy small planes, kites and helium balloons. Drones costing as little as <U+00A3>650 have proven useful. In 2013 drones have flown over at least six Peruvian archaeological sites, including the colonial Andean town Machu Llacta {{convert|4000|m}} above sea level. The drones continue to have altitude problems in the Andes, leading to plans to make a drone [[blimp]], employing open source software.<ref name=peru/>

Development costs for American military UAVs, as with most military programs, have tended to overrun their initial estimates.  This is mostly due to changes in requirements during development and a failure to leverage UAV development programs over multiple armed services. This has caused [[United States Navy]] UAV programs to increase in cost from 0% to 5%, while [[United States Air Force]] UAV programs have increased from 60% to 284%.<ref>[http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-09-520 Defense Acquisitions: Opportunities Exist to Achieve Greater Commonality and Efficiencies among Unmanned Aircraft Systems]</ref>

===Certification Aspects===
One of the main barriers to rapid full-scale growth of commercial unmanned aircraft is the concern for safety. As a myriad of certification agencies scramble to keep up with the unique demands of this fast-growing industry, one thing is clear <U+2013> where applicable, pertinent certification standards for manned aircraft are starting to apply. For the complex electronics that provide communication and control of these systems, this means a swift move towards compliance with [[DO-178C]] and [[DO-254]] for software and hardware development.<ref name="Navigating">{{cite book | title =Navigating Regulatory Compliance for UAV Electronics Development | date =2014-05-01 | url =http://www.techbriefs.com/feedback-footer-68/939-dtb/features/feature-articles/19616-navigating-regulatory-compliance-for-uav-electronics-development | magazine  =NASA Tech Briefs}}</ref> In most cases, the unmanned aircraft can only be operated as part of a system, hence the term <U+201C>unmanned aircraft system<U+201D> or UAS. The UAS consists of an unmanned aircraft (UA), a remote pilot station and the command, control and communications links that join them; as such, safety considerations address all of these elements.<ref name="Yearbook" >{{cite book | last =Cary | first =Leslie | last2 =Coyne | first2 =James | title =2011-2012 UAS Yearbook - UAS: The Global Perspective | publisher =Blyenburgh & Co | pages =112<U+2013>115 | contribution = ICAO Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS), Circular 328 | url =http://uvs-info.com/phocadownload/05_3a_2011/P112-P115_C&AI_ICAO-Advisory-Circular.pdf}}</ref>

In 2011,<ref name="Yearbook" /> the [[International Civil Aviation Organization]] of the United Nations published Circular 328 <U+2013> this document states a UAS should demonstrate equivalent levels of safety as manned aircraft and thus meet relevant government rules for flight and flight equipment. Within the United States, the Congress passed a bill in 2012 that mandated the FAA create a plan for allowing UAS into commercial airspace.  Subsequently, the FAA issued <U+201C>the Integration of Civil Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) in the National Airspace System (NAS) Roadmap<U+201D>.<ref name="Navigating" />

As of 2014, obtaining an [[Airworthiness certificate#Special Airworthiness Certificates|experimental airworthiness certificate]] for a particular UAS is the only way ''civil operators'' of unmanned aircraft are accessing the [[National Airspace System]] of the United States.<ref>{{cite web | title =Fact Sheet <U+2013> Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) | publisher =Federal Aviation Administration | date =January 6, 2014 | url =http://www.faa.gov/news/fact_sheets/news_story.cfm?newsId=14153 | accessdate = 2014-05-28}}</ref> [[FAA Order 8130.34]], ''Airworthiness Certification of Unmanned Aircraft Systems'', establishes procedures for issuing this certification, and as such establishes guidance standards for certification aspects of development and operation, which may be addressed by adoption of such standards as [[ARP4754|ARP4754A]], and [[DO-178C]].<ref>{{cite web | title =Transitioning to DO-178C and ARP4754A for UAV software development using model-based design | magazine  = Military Embedded Systems| date =July 27, 2012 | url =http://mil-embedded.com/articles/transitioning-do-178c-arp4754a-uav-using-model-based-design/# | accessdate = 2014-05-28}}</ref>

The FAA roadmap is, in essence, maturation of the acceptance of UAVs from this <U+201C>experimental<U+201D> aircraft certification to requiring the same standard airworthiness [[Type certificate|type certification]] of manufacturing design as is now required of conventional manned aircraft.<ref name="Navigating" />

===Degree of autonomy===
[[File:CBP unmanned aerial vehicle control.jpg|right|thumb|UAV monitoring and control at [[Office of Air and Marine|CBP]]]]
[[File:Himatsv2.jpg|thumb|[[Highly Maneuverable Aircraft Technology|HiMAT]] remote cockpit synthetic vision display (Photo: [[NASA]] 1984)]]

Early UAVs used during the Vietnam War captured video that was recorded to film or tape on the aircraft. These aircraft often flew either in a straight line or in preset circles collecting video until they ran out of fuel and landed. After landing, the film was recovered for analysis. Because of the simple, repetitive nature of these operations, the aircraft were often called "drones". As new radio control systems became available, UAVs were often remote controlled, and the term "remotely piloted vehicle" came into vogue. Today's UAVs often combine remote control and computerized automation. More sophisticated versions may have built-in control or guidance systems to perform low-level human pilot duties, such as speed and flight-path stabilization, and simple scripted navigation functions, such as waypoint following. In news and other discussions, the term "drone" is still often mistakenly used to refer to these more sophisticated aircraft.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}

Most early UAVs were not autonomous at all. The field of air-vehicle autonomy is a recently emerging field, largely driven by the military to develop battle-ready technology.<ref name="wahren09uavgc">{{cite book| author=Wahren, K., Cowling, I., Patel, Y., Smith, P., Breckon, T.P.| chapter=Development of a Two-Tier Unmanned Air System for the MoD Grand Challenge| title=Proc. 24th International Conference on Unmanned Air Vehicle Systems|date=March 2009| pages=13.1<U+2013>13.9}}</ref> Compared to the manufacturing of UAV flight hardware, the market for autonomy technology is fairly immature and undeveloped.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}

Autonomy technology that is important to UAV development falls under the following categories:
* [[Sensor fusion]]: Combining information from different sensors for use on board the vehicle including the automatic interpretation of ground imagery <ref name="sokalski10uavsalient">{{cite book| last1=Sokalski |first1=J |last2=Breckon |first2=T.P |last3=Cowling |first3=I.| chapter=Automatic Salient Object Detection in UAV Imagery| title=Proc. 25th International Conference on Unmanned Air Vehicle Systems|date=April 2010| pages=11.1<U+2013>11.12| url=http://www.durham.ac.uk/toby.breckon/publications/papers/sokalski10uavsalient.pdf| accessdate=5 November 2013 |format=pdf}}</ref><ref name="gaszczak11uavpeople">{{cite book| author=Gaszczak, A., Breckon, T.P., Han, J.| chapter=Real-time People and Vehicle Detection from UAV Imagery| title=Proc.

* Communications: Handling communication and coordination between multiple agents in the presence of incomplete and imperfect information
* Path planning: Determining an optimal path for vehicle to follow while meeting certain objectives and mission constraints, such as obstacles or fuel requirements
* Trajectory Generation (sometimes called [[Motion planning]]): Determining an optimal control maneuver to take in order to follow a given path or to go from one location to another
* Trajectory Regulation: The specific control strategies required to constrain a vehicle within some tolerance to a trajectory
* Task Allocation and Scheduling: Determining the optimal distribution of tasks amongst a group of agents within time and equipment constraints
* Cooperative Tactics: Formulating an optimal sequence and spatial distribution of activities between agents in order to maximize the chance of success in any given mission scenario

Autonomy is commonly defined as the ability to make decisions without human intervention. To that end, the goal of autonomy is to teach machines to be "smart" and act more like humans. The keen observer may associate this with the developments in the field of [[artificial intelligence]] made popular in the 1980s and 1990s, such as [[expert system]]s, [[neural network]]s, [[machine learning]], [[natural language processing]], and vision. However, the mode of technological development in the field of autonomy has mostly followed a bottom-up approach, such as [[hierarchical control system]]s,<ref>Shim, D. H, Kim, H. J., Sastry, S., [http://robotics.eecs.berkeley.edu/~sastry/pubs/PDFs%20of%20Pubs2000-2005/Publications%20of%20Postdocs/ShimDavid/ShimHierarchicalControl2000.pdf ''Hierarchical Control System Synthesis for Rotorcraft-based Unmanned Aerial Vehicles''].</ref> and recent advances have been largely driven by the practitioners in the field of [[Control (science)|control science]], not computer science.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} Similarly, autonomy has been and probably will continue to be considered an extension of the controls field.

To some extent, the ultimate goal in the development of autonomy technology is to replace the human pilot. It remains to be seen whether future developments of autonomy technology, the perception of the technology, and, most importantly, the political climate surrounding the use of such technology will limit the development and utility of autonomy for UAV applications. Also as a result of this, [[synthetic vision]] for piloting has not caught on in the UAV arena as it did with manned aircraft. NASA utilized synthetic vision for test pilots on the [[HiMAT]] program in the early 1980s (see photo), but the advent of more autonomous UAV autopilots greatly reduced the need for this technology.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}

Interoperable UAV technologies became essential as systems proved their mettle in military operations, taking on tasks too challenging or dangerous for troops. NATO addressed the need for commonality through STANAG (Standardization Agreement) 4586. According to a NATO press release, the agreement began the ratification process in 1992. Its goal was to allow allied nations to easily share information obtained from unmanned aircraft through common ground control station technology. Aircraft that adhere to the [[STANAG]] 4586 protocol are equipped to translate information into standardized message formats; likewise, information received from other compliant aircraft can be transferred into vehicle-specific messaging formats for seamless interoperability. Amendments have since been made to the original agreement based on expert feedback from the field and an industry panel known as the Custodian Support Team. Edition Two of STANAG 4586 is currently under review. There are many systems available today that are developed in accordance with STANAG 4586, including products by industry leaders such as AAI Corporation, [[CDL Systems]], and Raytheon, all three of which are members of the Custodian Support Team for this protocol.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

===Endurance===
Because UAVs are not burdened with the physiological limitations of human pilots, they can be designed for maximized on-station times. The maximum flight duration of unmanned aerial vehicles varies widely. Internal combustion engine aircraft endurance depends strongly on the percentage of fuel burned as a fraction of total weight (the [[Louis Charles Breguet|Breguet]] endurance equation) and so is largely independent of aircraft size.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}

[[File:UAV-741-F.jpg|thumb|UEL UAV-741 Wankel engine for UAV operations]]
Because of the small size, weight, very low vibration and high power to weight ratio, [[Wankel engine|Wankel rotary engines]] are increasingly being used in UAV aircraft.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rotarynews.com/node/view/1020 |title=New rotary takes flight in India |publisher=RotaryNews.com |accessdate=2014-02-06}}</ref> The engine is approximately one third of the size and weight of a piston engine of equivalent power output, which offers significant advantages for UAV aircraft.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rotronuav.com/ |title=Rotron Advanced Rotary Engines for UAV, VTOL & Military Applications |publisher=Rotronuav.com |accessdate=2014-02-06}}</ref> Additionally: the engine rotors cannot seize, since rotor casings expand more than rotors; the engine is not susceptible to shock-cooling during descent; it does not require an enriched mixture for cooling at high power and having no reciprocating parts, there is less vulnerability to damage when the engines revolves higher than the designed maximum running operation. The attributes of the Wankel engine transpire into less fuel usage in UAVs giving greater range or a higher payload.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rotronuav.com/capability/ |title=Rotron Rotary Engine Operational Capabilities |publisher=Rotronuav.com |accessdate=2014-02-06}}</ref>

Solar-electric UAVs hold potential for unlimited flight, a concept originally championed by the [[AstroFlight Sunrise]] in 1974<ref name="ProjectSunrisePg1">{{cite web|url = http://www.projectsunrise.info/First_Solar_Powered_Aircraft.html|title = Project Sunrise pg 1|accessdate = September 23, 2009|last = Boucher|first = Roland|authorlink = |year = undated}}</ref><ref name="ProjectSunrisePg13">{{cite web|url = http://www.projectsunrise.info/Flight__Tests.html|title = Project Sunrise pg 13|accessdate = September 23, 2009|last = Boucher|first = Roland|authorlink = |year = undated}}</ref><ref name="google2004">{{Cite book|url = http://books.google.com/books?isbn=1563476444|title = Unmanned aviation: a brief history of unmanned aerial vehicles|accessdate = September 23, 2009|last = Newcome|first = Laurence R.|authorlink = |year = 2004}}</ref><ref name="NASA2008">{{cite web|url = http://www.nasa.gov/centers/dryden/news/FactSheets/FS-054-DFRC.html|title = Solar-Power Research and Dryden|accessdate = September 15, 2009|last = Curry |first = Marty|authorlink = |date=March 2008}}</ref> and the much later Aerovironment [[Helios Prototype]], which was destroyed in a 2003 crash.

This approach is advocated by [[Jordin Kare]] and Thomas Nugent.

One of the major problems with UAVs is the lack of inflight refueling capability. In 2012, the US Air Force was promoting research that should end in an inflight UAV refueling capability.<ref name="xconomy.com">[http://www.xconomy.com/san-diego/2010/07/01/northrop-grumman-planning-first-uav-to-uav-aerial-refueling/2/ Northrop Grumman Planning First UAV-to-UAV Aerial Refueling]</ref> A UAV-UAV simulated refuelling flight using two [[Northrop Grumman RQ-4 Global Hawk|Global Hawk]]s was achieved in 2012.<ref>Kwan, Carissa (5 October 2012)   [http://www.irconnect.com/noc/press/pages/news_releases.html?d=10007491 Two Global Hawk Unmanned Aircraft Fly in Close Formation, Move AHR Program Closer to Autonomous Aerial Refueling] Northrop Grumman multimedia release, Retrieved 1 April 2013</ref>

One of the uses for a high endurance UAV would be to "stare" at the battlefield for a long period of time to produce a record of events that could then be played backwards to track where improvised explosive devices ([[Improvised explosive device|IEDs]]) came from.  Air Force Chief of Staff [[John P. Jumper]] started a program to create these persistent UAVs, but this was stopped once he was replaced.<ref>{{YouTube|ojGcX2H81NQ|counter_ied_backtracking.mpg}}{{dead link|date=March 2012}}</ref>

In 2007, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ([[DARPA]]) revealed a program to develop technology for a UAV with an endurance capability of over 5 years.

==Existing UAV systems==
{{update|section|date=September 2013}}

UAVs have been developed and deployed by many countries around the world. For a list of models by country, see: ''[[List of unmanned aerial vehicles]]''.  The use of unmanned aerial systems, however, is not limited to state powers: non-state actors can also build, buy and operate these combat vehicles.<ref name="Singer">Singer, Peter W. [http://www.brookings.edu/articles/2009/11_robotic_revolution_singer.aspx "A Revolution Once More: Unmanned Systems and the Middle East"], [http://www.brookings.edu/ The Brookings Institution], November 2009.</ref>

The export of UAVs or technology capable of carrying a 500&nbsp;kg payload at least 300&nbsp;km is restricted in many countries by the [[Missile Technology Control Regime]].  At the center of the American military's continued UAV research is the MQ-X, which builds upon the capabilities of the Reaper and Predator UAVs. As currently conceived, the MQ-X would be a stealthier and faster fighter-plane sized UAV capable of any number of missions: high-performance surveillance; attack options, including retractable cannons and bomb or missile payloads; and cargo capacity.<ref>Singer, Peter W. [http://www.brookings.edu/articles/2010/0517_robots_singer.aspx "How the US Military Can Win the Robotic Revolution"], [http://www.brookings.edu/ The Brookings Institution], 17 May 2010.</ref>

China has exhibited some UAV designs, but its ability to operate them is limited by the lack of high endurance domestic engines, satellite infrastructure, and operational experience.<ref>Axe, David.

==Public opinion in the US==

In February 2013, [[Fairleigh Dickinson University]]'s PublicMind poll found that 48% of American voters believe it is "illegal for the U.S. government to target its own citizens living abroad with drone attacks. Just 24% say that it's legal."<ref>Fairleigh Dickinson University's PublicMind. (February 7, 2013) [http://publicmind.fdu.edu/2013/drone Public Say It's Illegal to Target Americans Abroad as Some Question CIA Drone Attacks] Press release.</ref> "The public clearly makes an assumption very different from that of the Obama administration or Mr. Brennan: the public thinks targeting American citizens abroad is out of bounds," Peter Woolley, founding director of PublicMind and professor of political science at FDU, said to CNN.<ref>CNN Political Ticker blog. (February 7, 2013) [http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2013/02/07/poll-americans-back-drone-attacks-but-not-on-u-s-citizens-abroad/ Poll: Americans back drone attacks, but not on U.S. citizens abroad]</ref>

In the same poll, however, by a wide six-to-one margin (75% vs.13%), voters approved of the U.S. military using UAVs to carry out attacks abroad <U+201C>on people and other targets deemed a threat to the U.S.<U+201D> Republicans, men, and whites approve more strongly than Democrats, women, and non-whites, but approval is robust in all demographic categories. Voters also approve of the CIA using UAVs to carry out attacks abroad by a strong three-to-one margin (65% vs. 21%), but this approval is significantly less than approval for the U.S. military carrying out such attacks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://publicmind.fdu.edu/2013/drone/ |title=Respondents Question CIA Drone Attacks |publisher=Publicmind.fdu.edu |accessdate=2013-08-27}}</ref>

Despite this broad-based public support, there are a number of vocal critics of the increasing use of UAVs to track and kill terrorists and militants. A major criticism of drone strikes is that they result in excessive collateral damage. David Kilcullen and Andrew Exum wrote in the [http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/17/opinion/17exum.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0 New York Times] that "according to Pakistani sources, they have also killed some 700 civilians. This is 50 civilians for every militant killed, a hit rate of 2 percent." Other studies have put the civilian casualty rate anywhere between 4 and 35 percent.<ref>{{cite news|last=Shane|first=Scott|title=C.I.A. Is Disputed on Civilian Toll in Drone Strikes|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/12/world/asia/12drones.html?pagewanted=all|accessdate=July 2, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=August 11, 2011}}</ref> It is difficult to reconcile these figures because the drone strikes are often in areas that are inaccessible to independent observers and the data includes reports by local officials and local media, neither of whom are reliable sources. Critics also fear that by making killing seem clean and safe, so-called surgical UAV strikes will allow the United States to remain in a perpetual state of war. However, others maintain that drones "allow for a much closer review and much more selective targeting process than do other instruments of warfare" and are subject to Congressional oversight.<ref name="etzioni2013">{{cite journal|last=Etzioni|first=Amitai|title=The Great Drone Debate|journal=Military Review|date=March<U+2013>April 2013|url=http://icps.gwu.edu/files/2013/03/Etzioni_DroneDebate.pdf}}</ref> Like any military technology, armed UAVs will kill people, combatants and innocents alike, thus "the main turning point concerns the question of whether we should go to war at all."<ref name="etzioni2013"/>

==Morality==

The <U+201C>unmanned<U+201D> aspect of UAVs is primarily what sets them apart from manned aircraft. This aspect also raises certain moral concerns. Some believe that the asymmetry of fighting humans with machines that are controlled from a safe distance lacks integrity and honor that was once valued during warfare. Others feel that if such technology is available, then there is a moral duty to employ it in order to save as many lives as possible.<ref>{{cite news|last=Carroll|first=Rory|title=The philosopher making the moral case for US drones|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/02/philosopher-moral-case-drones|newspaper=The Guardian|date=2 August 2012}}</ref> Another potential moral issue with UAVs is that because they do not allow for pilot casualties, some fear that they will be used more frivolously, and that human lives affected by UAV-based strikes will not be regarded with as much consideration as with manned aerial attacks.

===Civilian death===

Some critics emphasize that the use of drones promotes not only a physical, but emotional disengagement from on the ground combat, for example, which is historically the foundation of military combat. This has a number of implications. Individuals taking on a critique of drone use challenge the supposed sense of morality and ethics that is taken on when justifying drone use. The evolution of new types of warfare creates a growing detachment from direct combat via the increased use of drones, and distances combatants from the consequences of their actions. Therefore, the use of drones is often associated with the idea that it is more ethical; the minimization of U.S. casualties due to this distancing, for example, is another reason drone use is increasingly looked at as an improved technique of war. Critics argue this detachment is failing to address the reality of innocent civilians being killed through this war strategy.

===Technology===
The use of drones can be understood as a manifestation and extension of the technological revolution in military affairs (RMA) discourse. The hegemonic masculinities in the American military influenced the development of technology as it became more prevalent following the [[Second World War]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Blanchard|first=Eric|title=Feminism and International Relations: Conversations about the Past, Present and Future|year=2011|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|page=152|authorlink=The Technoscience Question in Feminist International Relations: Unmanning the U.S. War on Terror|editor=J. Ann Tickner and Laura Sjoberg|chapter=The Technoscience Question in Feminist International Relations: Unmanning the U.S. War on Terror}}</ref> The entrenchment of this masculinity is even apparent in the present day, as women quite often have inferior positions to men in technology research, development, and use. These concerns are not only limited to drone use; [[cyborgs]] are also a manifestation of technology and new wars developing from RMA. These new types of technologies create new ways in which soldiers are conceptualized. Traditionally, soldiers were considered to be physical combatants, whereas now, technology in warfare blurs the distinction between autonomous users and who is representative of a soldier.<ref>{{cite book|last=Masters|first=Cristina|title=Gender Matters in Global Politics: A Feminist Introduction to International Relations|year=2010|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|page=183|authorlink=Cyborg Soldiers and Militarised Masculinities|editor=Laura J. Shepherd}}</ref>

===Examples===

One of the more mobilized groups engaged in this dialogue is [[Code Pink]], a grassroots peace movement concerned with global social justice.  This is a group primarily composed of women and led by women, seeking to mobilize against the United States military and the particular wars or battle campaigns they associate themselves with, either economically or militarily.<ref>{{cite book|last=Blanchard|first=Eric|title=Feminism and International Relations: Conversations about the Past, Present and Future|year=2011|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|page=147|authorlink=The Technoscience Question in Feminist International Relations: Unmanning the U.S. War on Terror|editor=J. Ann Tickner and Laura Sjoberg|chapter=The Technoscience Question in Feminist International Relations: Unmanning the U.S. War on Terror}}</ref> For example, Code Pink has facilitated a number of summits and campaigns against drones internationally and domestically.

==Legality==

A confidential Justice Department memo concludes that the U.S. government can order the killing of American citizens if they are believed to be <U+201C>senior operational leaders<U+201D> of [[Al-Qaeda]] or <U+201C>an associated force<U+201D> <U+2013> even if there is no intelligence indicating they are engaged in an active plot to attack the U.S.<ref name="Isikoff">{{cite web|last=Isikoff|first=Michael|title=Justice Department memo reveals legal case for drone strikes on Americans|url=http://openchannel.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/02/04/16843014-justice-department-memo-reveals-legal-case-for-drone-strikes-on-americans?lite|accessdate=2013}}</ref> The secrecy surrounding such strikes is quickly emerging as a central issue in the hearing of [[White House]] counterterrorism adviser [[John O. Brennan]], a key architect of the UAV campaign, to be CIA director. Brennan was the first administration official to publicly acknowledge UAV-based strikes in a speech last year, calling them <U+201C>consistent with the inherent right of self-defense.<U+201D> In a separate talk at the Northwestern University Law School, Attorney General [[Eric Holder]] specifically endorsed the constitutionality of targeted killings of Americans, saying they could be justified if government officials determine that the target poses <U+201C>an imminent threat of violent attack.<U+201D><ref name="Isikoff"/> But the confidential Justice Department <U+201C>[[white paper]]<U+201D> introduces a more expansive definition of self-defense or imminent attack than described by Brennan or Holder in their public speeches  It refers, for example, to what it calls a <U+201C>broader concept of imminence<U+201D> than actual intelligence about any ongoing plot against the U.S. homeland. "The condition that an operational leader presents an <U+2018>imminent<U+2019> threat of violent attack against the United States does not require the United States to have clear evidence that a specific attack on U.S. persons and interests will take place in the immediate future,<U+201D> the memo states.<ref name="Isikoff"/> Instead, an <U+201C>informed, high-level<U+201D> official of the U.S. government may determine that the targeted American has been <U+201C>recently<U+201D> involved in <U+201C>activities<U+201D> posing a threat of a violent attack and <U+201C>there is no evidence suggesting that he has renounced or abandoned such activities.<U+201D> (The memo does not define <U+201C>recently<U+201D> or <U+201C>activities.<U+201D>)

As in Holder<U+2019>s speech, the confidential memo lays out a three-part test that would make targeted killings of American lawful: in addition to the suspect being an imminent threat, capture of the target must be <U+201C>infeasible, and the strike must be conducted according to <U+201C>[[laws of war]] principles.<U+201D> But the memo elaborates on some of these factors in ways that go beyond what the attorney general said publicly. For example, it states that U.S. officials may consider whether an attempted capture of a suspect would pose an <U+201C>undue risk<U+201D> to U.S. personnel involved in such an operation. If so, U.S. officials could determine that the capture operation of the targeted American would not be feasible, making it lawful for the U.S. government to order a killing instead, the memo concludes. The undated memo is entitled <U+201C>Lawfulness of a Lethal Operation Directed Against a U.S. Citizen who is a Senior Operational Leader of [[Al Qaeda]] or An Associated Force.<U+201D>  It was provided to members of the Senate Intelligence and Judiciary committees in June 2013 by administration officials on the condition that it be kept confidential and not discussed publicly.<ref name="Isikoff"/> Although not an official legal memo, the white paper was represented by administration officials as a policy document that closely mirrors the arguments of classified memos on targeted killings by the Justice Department<U+2019>s  [[Office of Legal Counsel]], which provides authoritative legal advice to the president and all executive branch agencies. The administration has refused to turn over to Congress or release those memos publicly or to even publicly confirm their existence. A source with access to the white paper, which is not classified, provided a copy to [[NBC News]].<ref name="Isikoff"/>

The white paper also includes a more extensive discussion of why targeted strikes against Americans does not violate constitutional protections afforded to American citizens as well as a U.S. law that criminalizes the killing of U.S. nationals overseas. It also discusses why such targeted killings would not be a war crime or violate a U.S. executive order banning assassinations. <U+201C>A lawful killing in self-defense is not an assassination,<U+201D> the white paper reads. <U+201C>In the Department<U+2019>s view, a lethal operation conducted against a U.S. citizen whose conduct poses an imminent threat of violent attack against the United States would be a legitimate act of national self-defense that would not violate the assassination ban. Similarly, the use of lethal force, consistent with the laws of war, against an individual who is a legitimate military target would be lawful and would not violate the assassination ban.<U+201D><ref name="Isikoff"/>
