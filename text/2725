Doctor '''William "Will" Zimmerman''' is a main character and male lead of the Canadian [[fantasy]]-[[science fiction]] [[television series]] ''[[Sanctuary (TV series)|Sanctuary]]''. He is portrayed by [[Robin Dunne]]. Will is introduced in the series as a [[Forensic psychiatry|forensic psychiatrist]] who was recruited by [[Helen Magnus]] ([[Amanda Tapping]]), head of the Sanctuary Network, to become her recent prot<U+00E9>g<U+00E9>.

Dunne was apporached to appear on the series by director [[Martin Wood]], whom he worked with before, but was initially reluctant to appear in the original web series. Dunne's portrayal of Will vastly differed in the first season, while the second would introduce more darkness to the character.

Some television critics compared the character to ''[[Stargate SG-1]]'' character [[Daniel Jackson (Stargate)|Daniel Jackson]]. Dunne's portrayal of Will earned him a [[Leo Award]] for "Best Lead Performance by a Female in a Dramatic Series" in 2010. He was nominated a further two Leo Awards in the same categories and a Constellation Award, in which he narrowly lost to ''[[Doctor Who]]'' actor [[David Tennant]].

===Season one===
The [[Sanctuary (season 1)|first season]] begins with Will investigating the deaths of two police officers; though the police believe they found the killer, Will believes there was a child in the apartment, but his theory was rebuked. He is later recruited by Helen Magnus to join her Sanctuary team, an organization who track down several abnormals around the world and give them refuge at one of their bases, and become her new prot<U+00E9>g<U+00E9>. She too believes there was a child, Alexei (Cainan Weibe),<ref name=ep101/> who killed his victims with an appendage when he feels scared.

In one final effort to convince her to stop, Will is to die so he can encounter Kali, along with two other beings, in an [[afterlife]] to convince them to stop the tsunamis.

==Characterization==
{{Rquote|right|''I really like the commitment that Will has.

Will Zimmerman is described by Syfy as "a brilliant forensic psychiatrist" and a "master of behavioral science" who "can translate the most veiled human signals into case-breaking deductions."<ref name=syfy1/> However, his fascination with otherworldy explanations for horrific crimes cost him the respect of his peers and position. His qualities have attracted the attention of Magnus, who offers him a position in the Sanctuary.<ref name=syfy1>{{cite web |url=http://www.syfy.com/sanctuary/cast/will_zimmerman |title=Sanctuary Cast, Will Zimmerman |accessdate=August 10, 2011 |publisher=[[Syfy|Syfy.com]]}}</ref> He would become her newest prot<U+00E9>g<U+00E9> throughout the series.

And really, they're two people that depend on each other for survival. And therefore, that's where the respect comes out of."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blastr.com/2011/04/stars-spill-11-behind-the.php |title=11 behind-the-scenes secrets about tonight's return of Sanctuary |first=Kathie |last=Huddleston |date=April 15, 2011 |accessdate=August 10, 2011 |publisher=[[Blastr]]}}</ref>

In a [[Blastr]] interview, Dunne explained Will's journey throughout the first season, and what has become of him for the second; "[In the first season] he spent time getting used to the sanctuary and having his foot in both worlds, but not sure which way he was going to go. By the end of season one, he jumped right into the sanctuary and resigned himself to that life. Now there's a lot going on for Will. Already he's had to deal with some pretty major things. These things that happen in the first few episodes [on the second season] dredge up some old memories of his past. There's definitely more of a darkness to Will, and he's kind of wrestling with some demons."<ref name=dunneinterview/>

==Conceptual history==
[[File:Robin Dunne.JPG|thumb|upright|Robin Dunne, at the Comic-Con panel in 2008 promoting the series.]]
[[Damian Kindler]] conceived the series in 2001, and several of his original ideas ended in the finale product, one of them was Magnus "co-op[ing] a young psychiatrist to help her track down monsters and help people."<ref>{{cite video |people=[[Damian Kindler]] |title=Welcome to the Sanctuary |date=2009 |medium=Sanctuary: The Complete First Season (DVD) Disc 4 |publisher=[[E1 Entertainment]]}}</ref> Dunne was approached by director [[Martin Wood]], who he worked with a few years before. He was given the script and enjoyed "everything" about it, including his character. However, Dunn had some initial reluctance to appear on the show as it would start as a web series, and web series were not given enough media coverage at the time he was approached. However, he agreed to appear and went to [[Vancouver]] to film it.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.buddytv.com/articles/sanctuary/exclusive-interview-with-sanct-23713.aspx |title=Exclusive Interview with 'Sanctuary' Star Robin Dunne (listen to the audio file) |first=John |last=Kubicek |date=October 17, 2008 |accessdate=August 11, 2011 |publisher=[[BuddyTV]]}}</ref> After the series was adapted for television, the producers found that Dunne's portrayal of Will differed vastly.<ref name="ac_101">{{cite video |people=[[Damian Kindler]], [[Amanda Tapping]], [[Martin Wood]] |date=2009 |title=Audio Commentary for "Sanctuary for All, Part 1" |medium=Sanctuary: The Complete First Season (DVD) Disc 1 |publisher=[[E1 Entertainment]]}}</ref> The episode "Requiem" featured a scenario where Will has to make a difficult decision to kill Magnus when she becomes a threat, even thought Will already came to be an established prot<U+00E9>g<U+00E9>.<ref name="ac_109">{{cite video |people=[[Damian Kindler]], [[Amanda Tapping]], [[Martin Wood]] |date=2009 |title=Audio Commentary for "Requiem" |medium=Sanctuary: The Complete First Season (DVD) Disc 3 |publisher=[[E1 Entertainment]]}}</ref> By the first season finale, the producers wanted to introduce a potential love interest for Will.

In the first few episodes in the second season, Dunne has said that playing Will was challenging, yet exciting for the character's journey.<ref name=dunneinterview>{{cite news |url=http://scifiwire.com/2009/05/sanctuarys-robin-dunne-te.php |title=Sanctuary's Robin Dunne teases season two |first=Brian |last=Cairns |date=May 8, 2009 |accessdate=June 16, 2009 |publisher=[[Blastr]]}}</ref> With regards to season three, Kindler said that Will would be instrumental in changing the audience's perspective on the series, since in the season's second episode "[[Firewall (Sanctuary)|Firewall]]", the unsolved mysteries that were locked in Will's mind would be unlocked and become the focal points of what the team would be doing. Kindler also decided to allow Will another love interest that would not be killed unlike Clara Griffin.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blastr.com/2010/10/sanctuarys-back-and-heres.php |title=Sanctuary's back (and here are 6 things you'll want to know) |first=Kathie |last=Huddleston |date=October 15, 2010 |accessdate=August 11, 2011 |publisher=[[Blastr]]}}</ref>

==Reception==
Some reviewers commented that Zimmerman is somewhat of ''Sanctuary'<nowiki>s</nowiki>'' equivalent of [[Daniel Jackson]] from ''Stargate SG-1''.<ref name=aboutscifi>{{cite web |url=http://scifi.about.com/od/sanctuary/fr/SANC_review.htm |title=Review: 'Sanctuary' Premiere |first=Mark |last=Wilson |accessdate=June 16, 2009 |publisher=about.com}}</ref><ref name=tvsquad>{{cite news |url=http://www.tvsquad.com/2008/10/04/sanctuary-sanctuary-for-all-season-premiere/ |title=Sanctuary: Sanctuary for All (series premiere) |first=Jason |last=Hughes |date=October 4, 2008 |accessdate=June 14, 2009 |publisher=TV Squad}}</ref> Mark Wilson of ''About.com'' stated that Zimmerman is the one character who "really pulls the viewer into Sanctuary's world.

Over the course of the series, Dunne's portrayal of Will have resulted in four award nominations, one of which was won. In 2009, he was nominated for a [[Gemini Award]] for "Best Performance by an Actor in a Continuing Leading Dramatic Role," for his role in "Requiem", but lost out to ''[[Flashpoint (TV series)|Flashpoint]]'' actor [[Enrico Colantoni]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.geminiawards.ca/gemini24/press/GEM24FullListNominationsandWinners.pdf |title=24th Annual Gemini Awards Full List of Nominations & Winners |accessdate=August 9, 2011 |publisher=Gemini Awards.ca}}</ref> In 2010, Dunne won a [[Leo Award]] for "Best Lead Performance by a Female in a Dramatic Series" for the season two episode "[[Pavor Nocturnus (Sanctuary)|Pavor Nocturnus]]".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.leoawards.com/winners_by_name_2010.html |title=Leo Awards, 2010 Winners by Name |accessdate=August 9, 2011 |publisher=Leo Awards.com}}</ref> In the same year, he was nominated for a Constellaton Award for "Best Male Performance in a 2009 Science Fiction Television Episode", but lost out to ''[[Doctor Who]]'' actor [[David Tennant]], for his role in the episode "[[The Waters of Mars]]", by only one percent of the votes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://constellations.tcon.ca/special1.shtml |title=The Constellation Awards - A Canadian Award for Excellence in Film & Television Science Fiction |accessdate=August 9, 2011 |publisher=Constellation Awards}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://constellations.tcon.ca/2010.shtml#W |title=Looking Back At...
