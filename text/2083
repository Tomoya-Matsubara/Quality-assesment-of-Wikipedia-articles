Jill made her debut appearance in 1996 as one of the protagonists of the original ''[[Resident Evil (1996 video game)|Resident Evil]]'' game, in which she is a member of the U.S. special police unit [[Special Tactics And Rescue Squad|STARS]] trapped in a mysterious mansion along with her team partner [[Chris Redfield]]. Jill is featured in several ''Resident Evil'' games including ''[[Resident Evil 3: Nemesis]]'', ''[[Resident Evil: The Umbrella Chronicles]]'', ''[[Resident Evil 5]]'' and ''[[Resident Evil: Revelations]]'', where she is in conflict against the shadowy company [[Umbrella Corporation]] and its splinter groups. Jill is also a founding member and key field operative of the paramilitary organization [[Bioterrorism Security Assessment Alliance|BSAA]].

Jill has received favorable critical reception, having been described as "a classic example" of a female horror game character, and featuring on numerous top character lists. She is also widely regarded as one of the most attractive female [[protagonist]]s in video games, and has sparked video game [[meme]]s. The [[Resident Evil (film series)|film series']] version of Jill was portrayed by [[Sienna Guillory]] and based off the game character's various incarnations. She was introduced as a co-protagonist of ''[[Resident Evil: Apocalypse]]'', made a brief appearance in ''[[Resident Evil: Afterlife]]'', and returned as the main antagonist of ''[[Resident Evil: Retribution]]''.

== Appearances ==
=== In video games ===
Jill Valentine first appears as one of two [[player character|playable]] protagonists of the original [[Resident Evil (1996 video game)|''Resident Evil'']] game (1996), in which she is an explosives expert of Raccoon Police Department's [[Special Tactics And Rescue Squad]] (STARS) and a partner to [[Chris Redfield]]. Jill's family ethnic background is half-[[French American|French]], half-[[Japanese American|Japanese]],<ref>''Computer & Video Games'' 170 (January 1996), page 16.</ref> and she is a former operative of the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]]'s secretive special unit known as [[Delta Force]],<ref>''Resident Evil 3'' Dreamcast manual, page 10.</ref> where she was an explosives expert.<ref name=ca>{{cite web|author=CapcomUnityVideos |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALR9KPT6dDI |title=Jill Valentine Tribute - Capcom Unity |work=Official [[Capcom]] channel on [[YouTube]] |date=14 February 2013 |accessdate=3 January 2015}}</ref> Before the game begins, the STARS, including Jill's Alpha team, are deployed to investigate a series of bizarre murders in the Arklay Mountains, a fictional area, where they discover and enter [[Umbrella Corporation]]'s Arklay Research Facility [[biological warfare]] site. Inside, with Chris missing, Jill initially works with [[Barry Burton]], another Alpha team member, as they inspect the mansion and battle its undead residents. Eventually, she and Chris discover that STARS commander, [[Albert Wesker|Captain Wesker]], had betrayed them. After defeating the monster [[Tyrant (Resident Evil)|Tyrant]] released by Wesker, Jill escapes the self-destructing mansion in [[Brad Vickers]]' helicopter along with Chris, Barry and the Bravo team's sole survivor [[Rebecca Chambers (character)|Rebecca Chambers]].<ref name=ca/><ref name=babe>{{cite web |url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/2010/01/08/babe-of-the-day-julia-voth |title=Babe of the Day: Julia Voth |last1=Hainsworth |first1=Jay |date=3 September 2009 |work=[[IGN]] |accessdate=3 January 2015}}</ref>

Jill returns as the protagonist of ''[[Resident Evil 3: Nemesis]]'' (1999), where she is forced to side with a mercenary named [[Carlos Oliveira (Resident Evil)|Carlos Oliveira]], a member of the Umbrella Corporation's paramilitary force who was betrayed by their employer. Through the game, Jill and Carlos cooperate to escape from the now-dead [[Raccoon City]] before it is destroyed with a nuclear strike by the U.S. government. Along the way, they fight [[Nemesis (Resident Evil)|Nemesis]], a modified Tyrant super soldier sent by Umbrella to dispose of the remaining STARS members. After several encounters with Nemesis, Jill is infected with the zombiefying T-virus, though Carlos is able to procure a vaccine from the nearby hospital. Finally, Jill defeats Nemesis and Barry Burton returns to Raccoon City to bring her and Carlos to safety moments before the city's destruction.<ref name=ca/><ref name=story>{{cite web |url=http://www.nintendoworldreport.com/feature/29110 |title=Resident Evil: The Story So Far |last1=Miller |first1=Zachary |date=29 January 2012 |work=[[Nintendo World Report]] |accessdate=3 January 2015}}</ref> Jill is also featured as a playable character in the "Heroes Mode" [[multiplayer]] section of the non-[[Canon (fiction)|canon]] [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] game ''[[Resident Evil: Operation Raccoon City]]'' (2012).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.joystiq.com/2011/12/15/heroes-mode-revealed-for-resident-evil-operation-raccoon-city/ |title=Heroes Mode revealed for Resident Evil: Operation Raccoon City |last1=McElroy |first1=Justin |date=15 December 2011 |work=[[Joystiq]] |accessdate=3 January 2015}}</ref>

During the game, however, Chris finds information suggesting that she may still be alive. Eventually, he discovers that Jill is under control of  Wesker, who used Jill's DNA and the remnants of the T-virus within her body to perfect his new Uroboros virus. Chris and his new partner [[Sheva Alomar]] manage to subdue Jill and free her from Wesker's influence.<ref name=ca/><ref>{{cite video game|title=[[Resident Evil 5]] |developer=Capcom |work=[[Capcom]] |date=13 March 2009 |platform=PS3 |version=1.0 |level=5-3|isolang= |quote=Wesker:So Slow to catch on.&nbsp;<U+2013> Pulls back hood on cloak and reveals Jill's face/Chris:Jill...}}</ref> Jill then works with a fellow BSAA agent Josh Stone, Sheva's mentor, to assist Chris and Sheva in defeating Wesker. Demand from fans wishing to play as Jill led to two additional DLC scenarios (also included in the Gold Edition of ''Resident Evil 5''): ''Lost in Nightmares'', showing the events leading up to Jill's disappearance, and ''Desperate Escape'', showing her fight to escape the facility she was being held in. She is also one of the playable characters in ''[[Resident Evil: The Mercenaries 3D]]'' (2011), an action game based on "The Mercenaries" [[minigame]] from ''Resident Evil 4'' and ''Resident Evil 5''.<ref name="reveal">{{cite web |url=http://www.capcom-unity.com/jgonzo/blog/2010/09/28/resident_evil:_the_mercenaries_3d_announced_for_nintendo_3ds |title=Resident Evil: The Mercenaries 3D Announced For Nintendo 3DS |date=28 September 2010 |work=[[Capcom]] |accessdate=3 January 2015}}</ref>

Jill and her new partner, Parker Luciani, now out of contact and uninformed of the dire situation they face, find the ship infested with a new breed of leech-like zombies, infected with a new, stronger strain of the T-virus: the T-Abyss virus. Meanwhile, Chris and his new partner Jessica make their way to the ship to find Jill and some answers. Together, they slowly unravel a global conspiracy involving an earlier outbreak of the original strain of the T-virus at the city of Terragrigia, and a botched investigation by a rival agency, the Federal Bioterrorism Commission (FBC). During this mission Jill is exposed to the T-Abyss and receives an experimental vaccine.

Outside of the ''Resident Evil'' series, Jill appears as a player character in the crossover fighting game ''[[Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes]]'' (2000), wearing her STARS uniform. She returns as a playable character in ''[[Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds]]'' and ''[[Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3]]'' (2011), where her design is based on her appearance in ''Resident Evil 5'', available as downloadable content.<ref>{{cite web |title=Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds Collector's Edition |accessdate=3 January 2015 |work=[[GameStop]] |url=http://www.gamestop.com/xbox-360/games/marvel-vs-capcom-3-fate-of-two-worlds-collectors-edition/88341}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://ign.com/games/marvel-vs-capcom-3-fate-of-two-worlds/ps3-92677 |title=Marvel Vs.

==== Design and portrayal ====
During development of the original ''Resident Evil'', Jill was conceived as physically weaker than the game's male protagonist Chris Redfield, but she was given more skills and weapons to compensate for this.<ref name="Resident Evil: Director's Cut">{{cite video game|title=Resident Evil: Director's Cut |developer=Capcom |publisher=Capcom |date=September 1997 |platform=PlayStation|level=Interview with Shinji Mikami and Hiroyuki Kobayashi |language=Japanese}}</ref> The game's director [[Shinji Mikami]] said about Jill and [[Claire Redfield|Claire]]: "I don't know if I've put more emphasis on women characters, but when I do introduce them, it is never as objects. In some games, they will be peripheral characters with ridiculous breast physics. I avoid that sort of obvious eroticism. I also don't like female characters who are submissive to male characters, or to the situation they're in. I won't portray women in that way. I write women characters who discover their interdependence as the game progresses, or who already know they are independent but have that tested against a series of challenges."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/sep/30/shinji-mikami-evil-within-resident-evil|title=Shinji Mikami: the godfather of horror games|author=Keith Stuart|work=[[The Guardian]] |date=30 September 2014 |accessdate=3 January 2015}}</ref> The development team for ''Resident Evil 3: Nemesis'', which was also overseen by Mikami, said Jill was deliberately designed to make her "beautiful for everybody" and appeal to both male and female gamers, as males would find her physically attractive and females would see her as a tough role model.<ref>"Comments from the Development Team", ''Resident Evil 3&nbsp;<U+2013> Design Notes,'' Biohazard 3 Last Escape Official Guide Book, (Capcom, 1999).</ref>

[[File:JuliaVothErinCummings09TIFF.jpg|thumb|left|[[Julia Voth]] with [[Erin Cummings]] in 2009. Voth portrayed a homage character "Jill" (later changed to "Gillian") in ''[[Project S.E.R.A.]]'']]

For the 2002 [[Resident Evil (2002 video game)|remake of ''Resident Evil'']], Capcom producer [[Hiroyuki Kobayashi (producer)|Hiroyuki Kobayashi]] said the team wanted Jill to be "a little cuter" so that "her action and atmosphere has charm". Her facial and physical appearance from the remake onwards is based on Canadian model and actress [[Julia Voth]], and her body was scanned into computers to make her look as much like Voth as possible. Character designer Kenichiro Yoshimura said that he "made Jill's face as much similar as I could to the model actress face."<ref name=ky>"Character sculpture by Kenichiro Yoshimura," ''Biohazard's development behind the story,'' Biohazard official website (Capcom, 2002).</ref> However, so that she remains a tough character, her body is designed to be "not skinny, more like muscular".<ref>Characters and New Enemies, ''Biohazard Official Navigation Book'' (Capcom, 2002) [[Enterbrain]].</ref>

[[File:Jill valentine battlesuit.png|thumb|A stylized version of Jill Valentine under [[Albert Wesker|Wesker]]'s control in ''[[Resident Evil 5]]'', as seen in ''[[Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3]]'' (that look was also used in the films ''[[Resident Evil: Afterlife|Afterlife]]'' and ''[[Resident Evil: Retribution|Retribution]]'')]]

On the subject of changes to Jill and Chris Redfield's appearance in ''Resident Evil 5'', production director Yasuhiro Anpo said that he tried "to preserve their image and imagined how they would have changed over the passage of time" and so they "made a new design that retained their signature color<U+2014>green for Chris, blue for Jill<U+2014>to carry over the same look from the past. The facial structures are mainly based on the visuals of the Nintendo GameCube version, and we added various details to these in order to develop a realistic structure."<ref>As quoted in "Character Concepts," ''Resident Evil 5: The Complete Official Guide, Collector's Edition'' (Prima Games, 2009), page 195.</ref> Jill's character model was paler than usual in this entry to the series and her hair was blonde, both of which were explained in-universe as being due to a pigment abnormality sustained while her body was under experimentation. Capcom producer [[Jun Takeuchi]] said Jill's [[Unlockable (gaming)|unlockable]] "classic look" STARS uniform from the original game was his favorite extra costume in ''Resident Evil 5''.<ref>{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120902062120/http://www.ugo.com/games/resident-evil-5-interview-with-jun-takeuchi |url=http://www.ugo.com/games/resident-evil-5-interview-with-jun-takeuchi |title=Resident Evil 5 - Interview with Jun Takeuchi] |date=2 March 2009 |work=[[UGO Networks|UGO]] |accessdate=3 January 2015 |archivedate=2 September 2012}}</ref>

Jill was voiced by [[Catherine Disher]] in ''Resident Evil 3'' and '' Marvel vs. Capcom 2''. Heidi Anderson voiced her in the 2002 GameCube remake of the first game. [[Patricia Ja Lee]] provided the voice and motion capture in ''The Umbrella Chronicles'', ''Resident Evil 5'' and all of its later released [[downloadable content]] (DLC), and ''Resident Evil: The Mercenaries 3D''. [[Kari Wahlgren]] assumed the role in ''Marvel vs. Capcom 3''; [[Michelle Ruff]] lent her voice to the character in ''Resident Evil: Revelations'' and ''Resident Evil: Operation Raccoon City''. Ruff said about her role: "Jills's voice says a lot about her personality. I kept her in my lower register. She's all business and not 'girly' at all. Almost military-ish."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.residentevil.com.br/entrevistas/michelleruff/english/ |title=Interviews: Michelle Ruff |work=REVIL |accessdate=3 January 2015}}</ref> {{clear left}}

==== Gameplay ====
Jill was one of the first two player characters in the ''Resident Evil'' series. In the original game, Jill plays very differently to Chris as she runs slower, can take less damage and is less accurate with firearms, but has two more inventory slots and an access to stronger weapons (including starting armed with a gun, while Chris begins with only a knife). She also carries a [[lock picking|lockpick]] capable of opening many doors and caches, knows how to play [[piano]] (which is useful in-game), and is aided by the overprotective Barry.<ref name="Resident Evil: Director's Cut"/> In the game's 2002 remake, she has a [[taser]] as her personal defensive weapon.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/2012/05/24/revisiting-the-resident-evil-remake |title=Revisiting the Resident Evil Remake |last1=Thomas |first1=Lucas M |date=24 May 2012 |work=[[IGN]] |accessdate=3 January 2015}}</ref> In ''Resident Evil 3: Nemesis'', Jill will enter the "Live Selection Mode" during certain sections of the game, in which the player is prompted to quickly choose between one of two possible actions (the choice of action affects the direction of the game and story, including which ending the player receives). It was also during this game that Jill became the first character to be able to perform a quick 180-degree turn, which has since become a staple of the series.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ign.com/games/resident-evil-3-nemesis/dc-15478 |title=Resident Evil 3: Nemesis  |work=[[IGN]] |accessdate=3 January 2015}}</ref>

In ''Marvel vs. Capcom 2'', Jill is a very fast and agile character that is able to summon monsters to attack her opponent.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/2009/07/09/marvel-vs-capcom-2-jill-vs-storm |title=Marvel vs. Capcom 2: Jill vs. Storm |last1=Goldstein |first1=Hilary |last2=de Souza|first2=Alex |date=9 July 2009 |work=[[IGN]] |accessdate=3 January 2015}}</ref> She can also heal the player's active character if she is summoned as a support character.
