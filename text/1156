'''Grindcore''', often shortened to '''grind''', is an [[extreme music]] genre that emerged during the mid<U+2013>late 1980s. It draws inspiration from some of the most abrasive music genres <U+2013>  including [[death metal]], [[industrial music]], [[Noise music|noise]] and the more extreme varieties of [[hardcore punk]].

Grindcore is characterized by heavily [[Guitar distortion|distorted]], [[Guitar tunings|down-tuned guitars]],<ref name= johnson200704>Johnson 2007, page 04.</ref><ref name = carcassmaniacs/> extreme [[tempo]]s, frequently accompanied by [[blast beat]]s, songs often lasting no more than two minutes (some are seconds long), and vocals which consist of [[Death growl|growls]] and high-pitched screams.<ref name= "vonhavoc">Felix von Havoc, Maximum Rock'n'Roll #198. [http://www.havocrex.com/press/article/1/20] Access date: June 20, 2008.</ref> Lyrical themes range from social and political issues ([[Napalm Death]]) to gore ([[Carcass (band)|Carcass]]) and humor ([[Anal Cunt]]).<ref name=comedy>{{cite web|url= http://www.decibelmagazine.com/features/apr2007/comedygrind.aspx|title= The History of Comedy Grind|author= Bartkewicz, Anthony|month= April | year= 2007|publisher= [http://www.decibelmagazine.com Decibel Magazine]|accessdate= 2008-06-21}}</ref> The style is most prevalent in North America and in Europe.

==Characteristics==
===Blast beat===
{{main|Blast beat}}
{{listen|filename=blast_beat.ogg|title=An example of a blastbeat|description=A blast beat played at tempos of 124, 160, 200 and 240 BPM, respectively.|format=[[Ogg]]}}
The blast beat is a drum beat characteristic of grindcore in all its forms,<ref name=macgregor>Adam MacGregor, Agoraphobic Nosebleed review, ''Dusted'', June 11, 2006. [http://www.dustedmagazine.com/reviews/2945] Access date: October 2, 2008.</ref> although its usage predates the genre itself. In Adam MacGregor's definition, "the blast-beat generally comprises a repeated, sixteenth-note figure played at a very fast tempo, and divided uniformly among the kick drum, snare and ride, crash, or hi-hat cymbal."<ref name=macgregor/> Blast beats have been described as "maniacal percussive explosions, less about rhythm per se than sheer sonic violence."<ref name=greenway>Strub, Whitney. [http://www.popmatters.com/music/interviews/napalm-death-060511.shtml"Behind the Key Club: An Interview with Mark 'Barney' Greenway of Napalm Death"]. ''PopMatters'', May 11, 2006. Accessed on September 17, 2008.</ref> Napalm Death coined the term,<ref name=greenway/> though this style of drumming had previously been practiced by others. Daniel Ekeroth argues that the blast beat was first performed by the Swedish [[D-beat]] group Asocial on their 1982 demo.<ref>Ekeroth, p. 22.</ref> [[Dirty Rotten Imbeciles|D.R.I.]] ("No Sense"<ref name=macgregor/>), [[Sepultura]] ("Antichrist"<ref>Sepultura, 1985, track 11.</ref>), [[Stormtroopers of Death|S.O.D.]] ("Milk"<ref>Stormtroopers of Death, 1985, track 11.</ref>), [[Sarc<U+00F3>fago]] ("Satanas"<ref>Sarc<U+00F3>fago, 1986, track 10.</ref>), [[Cryptic Slaughter]] and [[Repulsion (band)|Repulsion]]<ref name=repulsion/> also included the technique prior to Napalm Death's emergence.

===Guitar tuning===
The [[Gramophone record|vinyl]] [[A-side]] of Napalm Death's debut, ''[[Scum (album)|Scum]]'', is set to [[standard tuning]], while on side B the guitars are tuned down 2<U+00BD> steps. Their [[From Enslavement to Obliteration|second]] album and 1989's ''[[Mentally Murdered]]'' [[Extended play|EP]] were tuned to [[C (musical note)|C]][[Sharp (music)|#]]. ''[[Harmony Corruption]]'', their third offering, was tuned up to a [[D tuning|D]].<ref name= johnson200704>Johnson 2007, page 04.</ref> Fellow grindcore practitioners Carcass also had the habit of the downtuning their guitars - specifically, to [[B tuning|B]].<ref name=carcassmaniacs>{{cite web|url=

===Song length===
One well-known characteristic of grindcore and related genres is the 'microsong': songs lasting only a few seconds. In 2001, the ''[[Guinness Book of World Records]]'' awarded Brutal Truth the record for "Shortest Music Video" for 1994's "[[Extreme Conditions Demand Extreme Responses|Collateral Damage]]". The song lasts 4 seconds. In 2007, the video for the Napalm Death song "[[You Suffer]]" set a new "Shortest Music Video" record: 1.3 seconds.<ref name= "OCW">{{cite web|url= http://www.ocweekly.com/music/music/extreme-extremeness/24665|title= Extreme Extremeness|author= McPheeters, Sam|date= 2006-03-09|publisher= [http://www.ocweekly.com Orange County Weekly]|accessdate= 2008-06-18}}</ref>

Along with the microsong, it is characteristic of early grindcore to have diminutive song lengths. Such is the example of Carcass' ''[[Reek of Putrefaction]]'' (1988), where the song span averages about 1 minute and 48 seconds.<ref>Carcass (1988).</ref>

===Lyrical themes===
Napalm Death's songs address a variety of [[anarchist]] concerns, in the tradition of [[anarcho-punk]].<ref name= decibel2007/> These themes include [[anti-racism]], [[feminism]], [[anti-militarism]], and [[anti-capitalism]]. A number of grindcore musicians remain committed to political and ethical causes.<ref>"Grindcore Special," p. 46.</ref> Other grindcore groups, such as Carcass, have expressed [[body horror|disgust with the body]], and are famous for their [[vegetarianism]].<ref name=carcassmaniacs/> Carcass' work is sometimes identified as the origin of the [[goregrind]] style, which is devoted to these bodily themes.<ref>{{cite book

==History==<!--This section is redirected to from [[Proto-grindcore]].-->
===Precursors===
The early grindcore scene relied on an international network of [[tape trading]] and [[DIY ethic|DIY]] production.<ref name=grind44>"Grindcore Special," p. 44.</ref> The most widely acknowledged precursors of the grindcore sound are [[Siege (band)|Siege]],<ref>Steven Blush, "Boston Not L.A.", ''American Hardcore'', Feral House, p. 171.</ref> a [[hardcore punk]] group, and [[Repulsion (band)|Repulsion]], an early [[death metal]] outfit.<ref name=repulsion>Matthew Widener, "Scared to Death: The Making of Repulsion's ''Horrified''", ''Decibel'' no. 46, August 2008, p. 63-69.</ref>
Siege, from [[Weymouth, Massachusetts]], were influenced by classic [[Music of the United States#Rock, metal and punk|American]] [[hardcore punk|hardcore]] ([[Minor Threat]], [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]], [[Void]]) and by [[Music of the United Kingdom (1980s)|British]] groups like [[Discharge (band)|Discharge]], [[Venom (band)|Venom]], and [[Mot<U+00F6>rhead]].<ref name=Siege>Mudrian 2004, p. 50.</ref> Siege's goal was maximum velocity: "We would listen to the fastest punk and hardcore bands we could find and say, <U+2018>Okay, we<U+2019>re gonna deliberately write something that is faster than them'", drummer Robert Williams recalled.<ref name=Siege/>

Repulsion, from [[Flint, Michigan]], cited [[street punk]] groups like [[Discharge (band)|Discharge]] and [[Charged GBH]], [[crossover thrash]] such as [[Dirty Rotten Imbeciles]] and [[Corrosion of Conformity]], [[thrash metal]] like [[Slayer]], [[Metallica]], and [[Sodom (band)|Sodom]], early [[black metal]] ([[Venom (band)|Venom]]) and [[death metal]] ([[Possessed (band)|Possessed]]), hardcore punk, like [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]], and older [[hard rock]], as inspirational.<ref name=repulsion/> The group is often credited with inventing the classic grind [[blast beat]] (played at 190 [[beats per minute|bpm]]), as well as its distinctive bass tone.<ref name=repulsion/> [[Shane Embury]], in particular, advocates the band as the origin of Napalm Death's later innovations.<ref name=repulsion/> [[Kevin Sharp (heavy metal)|Kevin Sharp]] of [[Brutal Truth]] declares that "''[[Horrified]]'' was and still is the defining core of what grind became; a perfect mix of hardcore punk with metallic gore, speed and distortion."<ref>"Grindcore Special," p. 41.</ref>

Other groups in the British grindcore scene, such as [[Heresy (band)|Heresy]] and [[Unseen Terror]], have emphasized the influence of American [[hardcore punk]], including [[Septic Death]], as well as Swedish [[D-beat]].<ref>"Grindcore Special," p. 43.</ref> [[Sore Throat]] cites Discharge, [[Disorder (band)|Disorder]], and a variety of European D-beat and thrash metal groups, including [[Hellhammer]],<ref>"Grindcore Special," p. 45.</ref> and American hardcore groups, such as [[Poison Idea]] and DRI.<ref>"Grindcore Special," p. 45.</ref> [[Japanese hardcore]], particularly [[GISM]], is also mentioned by a number of originators of the style.<ref name=grind52>"Grindcore Special," p. 52.</ref> Other key groups cited by current and former members of Napalm Death as formative influences include [[Discharge (band)|Discharge]],<ref name= decibel2007>{{cite web|url= http://www.decibelmagazine.com/features/mar2007/justinbroadrick.aspx|title= Justin Broadrick|author= Bartkewicz, Anthony|month= March | year= 2007|publisher= [http://www.decibelmagazine.com Decibel Magazine]|accessdate= 2008-06-19}}</ref> [[Amebix]],<ref name= knac2003>{{cite web|url= http://www.knac.com/article.asp?ArticleID=1770|title= Fire in the Belly: Interview With Napalm Death's Mark "Barney" Greenway|author= Atkinson, Peter|date= 2003-02-07|publisher= [http://www.knac.com KNAC.COM]|accessdate= 2008-06-19}}</ref> [[Throbbing Gristle]],<ref name= mudrian3104>Mudrian 2004, page 31.</ref> and the aforementioned Dirty Rotten Imbeciles.<ref name= mudrian3104>Mudrian 2004, page 31.</ref> [[Post-punk]], such as [[Killing Joke]]<ref name= decibel2007/> and [[Joy Division]],<ref>Interview with Mick Harris, DVD half of Napalm Death's ''[[Scum (album)|Scum]]'' 20 year anniversary [[reissue]].</ref> was also cited as an influence on early Napalm Death.

===Napalm Death===
{{Main|Napalm Death}}
Grindcore, as such, was developed during the mid-1980s in the United Kingdom by [[Napalm Death]], a group who emerged from the [[crust punk]] scene.<ref name=crust>"Crustgrind," "Grindcore Special" part 2, p. 46</ref> The name "grindcore" is said to have been coined by Napalm Death's second drummer, [[Mick Harris]]. When asked about coming up with the term, Harris said the following:

{{cquote|Grindcore came from "grind", which was the only word I could use to describe [[Swans (band)|Swans]] after buying their first record in '84. Then with this new hardcore movement that started to really blossom in '85, I thought "grind" really fit because of the speed so I started to call it grindcore.<ref>Mudrian 2004, page 35.</ref>}}

Other sources contradict Harris' claim. In a ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' magazine article written about the genre, Steven Blush declares that "the man often credited" for dubbing the style grindcore was [[Shane Embury]], Napalm Death's bassist since 1987. Embury offers his own account of how the grindcore "sound" came to be:

{{cquote|As far as how this whole sound got started, we were really into [[Celtic Frost]], Siege - which is a hardcore band from [[Boston]] - a lot of hardcore and death-metal bands, and some industrial-noise bands like the early Swans. So, we just created a mesh of all those things. It's just everything going at a hundred miles per hour, basically.<ref name= blush36>Blush 1991, page 36</ref>}}

[[Earache Records]] founder [[Digby Pearson]] concurs with Embury, saying that Napalm Death "put hardcore and metal through an accelerator."<ref>Ibid., p. 35.</ref> Pearson, however, said that grindcore "wasn't just about the speed of [the] drums, blast beats, etc." He claimed that "it actually was coined to describe the guitars - heavy, downtuned, bleak, harsh riffing guitars [that] 'grind', so that's what the genre was described as, by the musicians who were its innovators [and] proponents."<ref>{{cite web|url= http://askearache.blogspot.com/2007_04_01_archive.html|title= Godflesh/PSI etc - are they Grind?|author= Pearson, Digby|date= 2007-04-26|publisher= [http://askearache.blogspot.com Ask earache - BraveWords.com]|accessdate= 2008-06-15}}</ref>

Napalm Death's seismic impact inspired other British grindcore groups, among them [[Extreme Noise Terror]],<ref name=crust/> [[Carcass (band)|Carcass]] and [[Sore Throat]].<ref name= "vonhavoc"/> Early American grind practitioners included [[Terrorizer]] and [[Ass<U+00FC>ck]].<ref name= "vonhavoc"/> [[S.O.B.

Journalist Kevin Stewart-Panko argues that the American grindcore of the 1990s borrowed from three sources: British grindcore, American thrashcore, and [[death metal]].<ref name=usgrind>Kevin Stewart-Panko, "Altered States," "Grindcore Special" part 2, p. 42-43.</ref> As early Napalm Death albums were not widely distributed in the United States, American groups tended to take inspiration from later works such as ''[[Harmony Corruption]]''.<ref name=usgrind/> American groups also often employ riffs taken from [[crossover thrash]] or [[thrash metal]].<ref name=usgrind/> [[Brutal Truth]] was a groundbreaking group in the American scene at the beginning of the 1990s.<ref name= "vonhavoc"/> However, Sharp indicates that they were more inspired by the thrash metal of [[Dark Angel (band)|Dark Angel]] than the British groups.<ref>"Grindcore Special," p. 41.</ref> [[Discordance Axis]], a group without a bass player, had a more technical style of playing than many of the predecessors, and had a much more ornate visual and production style.<ref name=usgrind/> [[Scott Hull]] is prominent in the contemporary grindcore scene, through his participation in [[Pig Destroyer]] and [[Agoraphobic Nosebleed]].<ref name = m265/> ANb's ''[[Frozen Corpse Stuffed with Dope]]'' has been described as "the ''[[Paul's Boutique]]'' of grindcore", by ''Village Voice'' critic Phil Freeman, for its "hyper-referential, impossibly dense barrage of samples, blast beats, answering machine messages, and incomprehensibly bellowed rants."<ref>Phil Freeman, "Gratuitous Grindcore Gross-Out Gimps' Glade and Guns Get Guffaws", ''Village Voice'', September 13, 2005.

[...] the genre is a part of the British musical experience.<ref>James Hoare, Terrorizer, #180, February 2009, p. 1.</ref>}} Grindcore's impact quickly spread through the world of [[extreme music]].
