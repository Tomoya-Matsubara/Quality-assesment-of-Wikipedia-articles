'''"El Curruch<U+00E1>"'''' is a well-known [[Venezuelan]] folk song in the [[joropo]] tradition, composed by [[Juan Bautista Plaza]] with lyrics by [[Vincente Emilio Sojo]]. <ref name="Labonville2007">{{cite book|author=Marie Elizabeth Labonville|title=Juan Bautista Plaza and Musical Nationalism in Venezuela|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Va4LCUDJ_VgC|accessdate=10 April 2013|date=12 July 2007|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=978-0-253-11696-3}}</ref>  

After its premire in 1928 the piece became quite popular, in part because of its connection with joropo.  It is lighter than much of Plaza's work; he never intended it to be viewed as [[art music]], but as a popular piece, and later referred to it as "a little youthful sin."  <ref name="Aponte2008">{{cite book|author=Pedro Rafael Aponte|title=The Invention of the National in Venezuelan Art Music, 1920--1960|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Gk8N_C1Gk48C|accessdate=10 April 2013|year=2008|publisher=ProQuest|isbn=978-1-109-05320-3|page=169}}</ref>

It has been performed by singer [[Jes<U+00FA>s Sevillano]], the [[Quinteto Contrapunto]] vocal ensemble, and flutist [[Hu<U+00E1>scar Barradas]], among others.
