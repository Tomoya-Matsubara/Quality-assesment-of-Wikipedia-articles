'''One Rincon Hill''' is a [[residential]] complex that is currently under [[construction]] on the apex of [[Rincon Hill]] in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]], [[California]], [[United States]]. The complex, designed by Solomon, Cordwell, Buenz and Associates and developed by Urban West Associates, consists of two [[skyscraper]]s that share a common [[townhouse]] podium. One tower, ''One Rincon Hill North Tower'', is planned to reach a height 495 feet (151 m) with 45 [[Floor|stories]].{{ref label|note01|A|f}}<ref name="EMP2">{{Cite web|title=One Rincon Hill North Tower|url=http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/bu/?id=1rinconhillnorthtower-sanfrancisco-ca-usa|publisher=Emporis.com|accessdate=2007-09-23}}</ref> The other tower, ''One Rincon Hill South Tower'', is 60 stories and stands 641&nbsp;feet (195&nbsp;m) tall.{{ref label|note01|A|e}}{{ref label|note02|B|c}} The South Tower contains a number of unique elements, such as high-speed elevations and a large water tank, designed to move residents effectively and help the skyscraper survive high-winds and [[earthquake]]s, respectively. Both skyscrapers and the townhomes contain a total of 709 residential units.

The building site, located right next to the western approach of the [[San Francisco <U+2013> Oakland Bay Bridge]], formerly contained a clock tower. The clock tower was demolished shortly after the city approved the One Rincon Hill project. Construction of the townhomes and the South Tower lasted from 2005 to 2008, but was stopped for brief periods of time due to seismic concerns and a construction accident. As the South Tower neared completion, it generated controversy concerning blocked views, pricing, and the architectural style of the One Rincon Hill complex.<ref name="SFGATEOPIN"/>

==Description==
;Location
The complex is located on a 1.3 [[acre]] (0.5 [[hectare|ha]])<ref name="SFGATEPRICE"/> on the apex of the Rincon Hill neighborhood. The site is bounded by Harrison Street to the west, the Fremont Street [[exit ramp]] to the north, the western approach to the Bay Bridge (Interstate 80) on the east, and the First Street [[entrance ramp]] to the south.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://maps.google.com/maps?ie=UTF8&ll=37.785957,-122.392427&spn=0.00184,0.005085&t=h&z=18|title=Google Maps|publisher=[[Google]]|accessdate=2008-08-11}}</ref><ref name="EMPCTB">{{Cite web|title=Clock Tower Building|url=http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/bu/?id=clocktowerbuilding-sanfrancisco-ca-usa|publisher=Emporis.com|accessdate=2007-09-24}}</ref>

;Earthquake engineering
In order to support the 60 story condo tower, One Rincon Hill South Tower will have a 12&nbsp;foot (4&nbsp;m) thick massive foundation embedded deep into [[serpentine]] rock. Although some engineers view serpentine rock with suspicion, there are massive structures, such as the [[Golden Gate Bridge]], that have foundations on rock that is largely serpentine.<ref name="SFGATEENG">{{Cite web|title=Tall, skinny&nbsp;... stable|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/chronicle/archive/2006/07/02/BAGD5JO3A41.DTL|date=2006-07-02|accessdate-2007-09-24|publisher=''San Francisco Chronicle''|accessdate=2007-09-24}}</ref> Rising out of the foundation are the concrete core and large, tall columns of steel-reinforced concrete called outriggers. The core is attached to large outrigger columns by steel-buckling restrained braces that are designed to transfer building loads in an earthquake. These V-shaped restraining braces are said to act like a shock-absorber during earthquakes. The braces are also encased in a concrete and steel casing in order to prevent the braces from buckling and losing their strength. Many of these engineering technologies used in One Rincon Hill South Tower are new to the United States.<ref name="SFGATEENG"/><ref name="YouTubeEng"/>

;Water tanks
At the top of the building is a large tank, capable of holding up to 50,000 [[gallon]]s (189,250 [[litre]]s) of water, which will weigh 416,500 [[pound (mass)|pound]]s (185,440 kg).<ref name="SFGATEWATER"/><ref name="YouTubeEng">{{Cite web|title=San Francisco One Rincon Hill Earthquake Proof|url=http://youtube.com/watch?v=h3UVMHjvFWs&mode=related&search=|publisher=KRON4 and [[YouTube]]|accessdate=2007-09-23}}</ref> A similar 50,000 gallon (189,250 liter) tank is located in the basement for firefighting purposes.<ref name="SFGATEWATER"/> There are two liquid damper screens in each tank to control the flow of the water in order to counter the sway from the powerful [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] winds, which can sometimes reach hurricane-force.<ref name="SFGATEENG"/>

;Elevators
The South Tower contains one freight elevator and three for residents to use. The elevators are the second fastest in the city of San Francisco, second only to those in [[555 California Street]] and tied with those in [[555 Mission Street]].<ref name="SPEC">{{Cite web|title=555 Mission Street Specifications|url=http://www.555missionst.com/property/specifications.html|accessdate=2007-09-26|abbr=on}}</ref> Nevertheless, the elevators of the South Tower can travel from the first floor to level 61 (the mechanical level) in only 26 seconds to speed passenger traffic flow. This means the elevators can travel about 1,200 vertical feet (366 m) in a minute. In addition to the high speed, the elevators come equipped with artificial intelligence control systems. These systems figure out passenger traffic patterns and dispatch the three elevators to handle passenger needs accordingly. For safety purposes, the bottom of each elevator shaft has a cylinder filled with hydraulic oil to stop a falling elevator without injuring the passengers inside.<ref name="EL"/>

;Residences
The entire project will provide 695 [[condominium|condos]] located in the highrises and 14 [[townhome]]s located at the foot of the towers for a total of 709 units.<ref name="NCSORH">{{Cite web|title=One Rincon Hill brings new grace to Bay area|url=http://onerinconhill.com/popup_news_020207.asp|publisher=Newcity Skyline|date=2007-02-02|accessdate=2007-09-24}}</ref> 376 of those condo units are located in the South Tower and the North Tower contains the other 319 units.<ref name="SFBIZDEV"/><ref name="SFMOVE">{{Cite web|title=One Rincon residents are moving in|publisher=''San Francisco Chronicle''|first=Carl|last=Nolte|date=2008-03-07|accessdate=2008-04-21|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/03/07/BAH3VF2F1.DTL}}</ref> Because of their height, both towers will offer spectacular vistas of the surrounding landscapes.<ref name="ORHAerial"/> There are 26 different [[floor plan]]s for the 695 condos which are financially beyond the reach of many citizens residing in San Francisco.<ref name="NCSORH"/> The units vary greatly in price from USD $500,000<ref name="SFGATEPRICE">{{Cite web|title=ONE RINCON: Building a High-Rise CITY'S SKYLINE MOVING UPSCALE Condos in the high-rise towers will start at $500,000 -- it's pricey, but there is a killer view from the top|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/06/14/BAGBEJDLGJ1.DTL|date=2006-06-14|accessdate=2007-09-24|publisher=''San Francisco Chronicle''}}</ref> to USD $2,500,000,<ref name="SFGATECONST">{{Cite web|title= Dance of the concrete SAN FRANCISCO: Pouring the floors for the {{convert|600|ft|m|sing=on}} One Rincon Hill tower involves a blend of high technology and old-fashioned muscle -- it is also a race against the clock|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/04/16/BAGQAP986G1.DTL&hw=one+rincon+hill&sn=001&sc=1000|date=2007-04-17|accessdate=2007-09-24|publisher=''San Francisco Chronicle''}}</ref> depending on view and the size of the unit (600 to 2,000 [[Square feet|ft<U+00B2>]] or 56 to 186 [[Square metre|m<U+00B2>]]).<ref name="SFGATEPRICE"/> The project opened up a sales office on June 16, 2006 and even before the opening, condo-buyers placed deposits for 130 of the South Tower's 376 condo units in a selling spree.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Condo units fly out door, before doors even open|url=http://sanfrancisco.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/stories/2006/06/19/tidbits1.html|publisher=''San Francisco Business Times''|date=2006-06-16|accessdate=2007-09-24}}</ref> The Sales Center is rumored to have cost USD $2,000,000 to build.<ref name="SFGATEPRICE"/> The condo units in One Rincon Hill South Tower are selling well for a building that has not been completed yet.<ref name="SFGATECONST"/> The first residents began moving into the South Tower in February 2008.<ref name="SFMOVE"/><ref>{{Cite web|title=New residents unpack at S.F. condo towers: It can be lonely at the top|publisher=San Francisco Business Times|accessdate=2008-03-24|date=2008-02-29|first=J.K.|last=Dineen|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/stories/2008/03/03/story3.html}}</ref> Sales for the North tower are set to begin in early-2009.<ref name="SFBIZDEV"/>

A 183&nbsp;feet (56&nbsp;m) tall clock tower, owned by [[UNION 76]] and then [[Bank of America]] was originally on the site.<ref name="EMPCTB"/> However, this was deemed an ineffective use of the land, and so in 2003, Urban West Associates bought the land and later proposed the first version of the complex on the same site.<ref name="SFGATENS">{{Cite web|title=A NEW SKYLINE RINCON HILL|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2003/06/15/MN190427.DTL|date=2003-06-15|publisher=''San Francisco Chronicle''|accessdate=2007-09-24}}</ref> The proposal, named 475 First, consisted of a 28 and 33 story residential tower and would have 506 residential units.<ref name="SFGATENS"/> The city, after the initial proposal, changed the zoning in Rincon Hill neighborhood and raised height limits.<ref>{{Cite web|title=SAN FRANCISCO|url=http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2004/02/04/BAGL84OIAF1.DTL|date=2004-02-04|publisher=''San Francisco Chronicle''|accessdate=2007-09-24}}</ref> The developer proposed a second (current) version of One Rincon Hill in response to these zoning changes.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Rincon Hill on the rise|url=http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2005/04/18/BAG7KCAJG11.DTL|publisher=''San Francisco Chronicle''|date=2005-04-18|accessdate=2007-09-24}}</ref> The second and final version project was approved by the city on August 4, 2005.<ref name="EMPORHComplex"/> Before construction of One Rincon Hill, the clock tower was razed to make way for the construction of the towers.<ref name="EMPORHComplex"/><ref>{{Cite web|title=The city has a chance to create a great neighborhood on Rincon Hill|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2005/09/29/DDGA1EUURN1.DTL&hw=bay+bridge+clock+tower&sn=021&sc=265|author=John King|date=2005-09-29|publisher=''San Francisco Chronicle''|accessdate=2007-09-24}}</ref> 

===Construction===
:''For a detailed gallery of the construction, see [[User:SF Construction Photos#One Rincon Hill|SF Construction Photos]]''
====South Tower====
Three months after San Francisco approved of the project, construction began on the South Tower and townhouses with a groundbreaking ceremony on November 10, 2005. The South Tower was the [[List_of_tallest_buildings_in_San_Francisco#Under_construction|second-tallest tower under construction]] in San Francisco. However, building work began without an approved construction permit from the city's Department of Building Inspection and Construction, and city engineers stopped the project.

== Criticism ==
With condo prices set at USD $5-600,000 to USD $2,000,000, many critics have noted that the One Rincon Hill complex is too expensive for most San Franciscans.<ref name="SFGATEPRICE"/><ref name="NCSORH"/> (As stated above, the total initial development cost was $290 million, so the average development cost per unit with 709 units total is approximately $409,000.) In addition, few construction workers currently building the south tower can afford to purchase a unit in the tower.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Crew adores Rincon tower but can't afford to live there|url=http://onerinconhill.com/popup_news_081306.asp|date=2006-08-13|publisher=''San Francisco Chronicle''|accessdate=2007-09-24}}</ref> However, the developer Urban West Associates has contributed a total of USD $38.5 million to funds like the South of Market Community Stabilization Fund in order to address this concern.<ref name="NCSORH"/>

The height and placement of the South Tower is also a concern to residents living east to northeast of [[Twin Peaks, San Francisco, California|Twin Peaks]], because new building projects in the [[South of Market]] district are located on the line of sight between the Bay Bridge and Twin Peaks.<ref>{{Cite web|title=One Rincon Hill Thread-Post 719|url=http://forum.skyscraperpage.com/showthread.php?t=107919&page=29|author=Donald Swearingen|publisher=SkyscraperPage|accessdate=2007-08-17}}</ref><ref name="BLOCK">{{cite web|url=http://maps.google.com/maps?ie=UTF8&ll=37.773021,-122.414303&spn=0.058889,0.162735&t=h&z=13|title=Google Maps|publisher=[[Google]]|accessdate=2008-08-11}}</ref> One Rincon Hill South Tower has obstructed the view of the bridge from [[Dolores Park]] and the hillside neighborhoods to its immediate south-southwest. Moreover, the completed structure blocks views of the City's hills once afforded to incoming travelers on the upper deck of the Bay Bridge itself.<ref name="BLOCK"/>

The building's architectural design generated a wide range of opinions.<ref name="SFGATEOPIN">{{Cite web|title=Towering opinions on Rincon high-rise, from 'elegant' to 'atrocity'|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/08/13/BA1URGRN2.DTL&hw=One+Rincon+Hill&sn=009&sc=1000|date=2007-08-13|author=Carl Nolte|publisher=''San Francisco Chronicle''|accessdate=2007-09-24}}</ref> Some residents of San Francisco and bloggers of the website SocketSite regarded the South Tower as an elegant structure. However, the website Curbed San Francisco  named One Rincon Hill South Tower as the ugliest building in the city, surpassing the [[San Francisco Marriott]] (often called the Jukebox Building) by a wide margin.<ref name="SFGATEOPIN"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://sf.curbed.com/archives/2007/04/02/the_curbed_sf_ugly_building_contest_bigger_longer_unfinished.php|title=The Curbed SF Ugly Building Contest: Bigger, Longer, Unfinished|first=Philip|date=2007-04-02|publisher=Curbed San Francisco|accessdate=2008-08-11}}</ref> Based on these remarks, the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' considers this building to be the most controversial landmark in San Francisco since the completion of the [[Transamerica Pyramid]].<ref name="SFGATEOPIN"/>

Sources like the corresponding SkyscraperPage thread list the tower at {{Convert|641|ft|m|0}} tall with 60 floors, leaving out the topmost two levels. [http://forum.skyscraperpage.com/showthread.php?t=107919 Source.] However, the San Francisco project rundown thread on the same site lists the tower at {{Convert|641|ft|m|0}} with only 55 floors, omitting the five underground and topmost two non-residential levels. [http://forum.skyscraperpage.com/showthread.php?t=24868 Source.] Emporis lists the building at 605 feet (184 m) and omits the lobby level in addition to the seven nonresidential levels from the floor count, leading to a count of 54 floors. [http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/bu/?id=1rinconhillsouthtower-sanfrancisco-ca-usa Source.] Another site gives no height figure but mentions the tower has 62 levels. [http://www.luxist.com/2007/08/15/one-rincon-hill/ Source.] At least one ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' article states the building is {{Convert|641|ft|m|0}} tall with 62 levels, which includes the seven nonresidential levels. [http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/object/article?f=/c/a/2007/08/13/BA1URGRN2.DTL&o=0 Source.] However, another Chronicle article uses a different measuring location, stating that the south tower has {{Convert|605|ft|m|0}} and 60 floors.
