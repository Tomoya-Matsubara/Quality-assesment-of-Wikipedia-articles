'''''Beyonc<U+00E9>''''' <!-- Don't add "stylized as BEYONCE", it's unnecessary --> is the fifth [[studio album]] by American recording artist [[Beyonc<U+00E9>]], released on December 13, 2013 by [[Parkwood Entertainment]] and [[Columbia Records]]. Described as a visual album, ''Beyonc<U+00E9>'' is a simultaneous audio and visual experience where non-linear short films accompany its songs to illustrate the concepts that were conceived during its composition.  It has been identified as one of the most explicit albums ever recorded, with [[feminist]] themes that are much darker than her previous material, including sex, fear, loss and the insecurities of marriage and motherhood.

The album began production in 2012 in New York where musicians were gathered in unconventional circumstances where they lived and worked with Beyonc<U+00E9> for a month. During extensive touring in 2013, the nature of the project changed as she desired to put together short films and favored an unexpected release. As a consequence, the album's status and its visual aspect were kept out of public knowledge. She resumed recording in strict secrecy and held sessions with [[rock (music)|rock]] musician [[Boots (musician)|Boots]] who worked on most of the album. Their collaboration led to more sonically experimental material which combined [[rhythm and blues]] with [[electronic music]]; songs from these sessions were loosely structured and characterized by eccentric musical effects 
and diverse vocal styles including [[Rapping|rap]], [[Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|streams of consciousness]] and [[falsetto]].

''Beyonc<U+00E9>'' was released digitally without prior announcement, which led to a hysterical response from the public. It received rave reviews from music critics, who commended its production, themes and Beyonc<U+00E9>'s vocals and was ranked as the best album of 2013 by several publications. It debuted at number one on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], giving Beyonc<U+00E9> her fifth consecutive number one album, and sold 828,773 copies worldwide in three days, becoming the fastest-selling album in [[iTunes Store]] history. It spawned four singles<U+2014>"[[XO (song)|XO]]", "[[Drunk in Love]]", "[[Partition (song)|Partition]]" and "[[Pretty Hurts (song)|Pretty Hurts]]"<U+2014>and has sold 3.36 million units globally.

In mid-2013, a newly discovered musician [[Boots (producer)|Boots]], notable for fronting rock band [[Blonds (band)|Blonds]], signed a publishing deal with Jay-Z's [[Roc Nation]]. In an interview for Pitchfork after the album's release, Boots was coy when answering questions about how Beyonc<U+00E9> discovered his demo or of his work previous to the project, only confirming his signing. In June 2013, they met in person for the first time and presented her with material he felt would resonate with her. However, Beyonc<U+00E9> was more interested in his experimental material, and he reluctantly played her the piano demo of "Haunted" on his cellphone, believing its instrumental to be lacklustre. She disagreed and refused to ignore it, saying "this shit has to knock harder than any rap album out there". At a later meeting, he played her a [[Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream of consciousness]] rap called "Ghost", which he wrote after an exasperating meeting with a potential record label. Boots began by composing a [[melody]] that reminded him of a hypnotic state, then layering guitar [[arpeggios]] to resemble the work of English electronic musician [[Aphex Twin]]. Subsequently, "Ghost" became the first half of "Haunted"; he later described Beyonc<U+00E9> as the "only visionary in the room" for her ability to find potential in scraps of songs. Following these sessions, Boots would go on to work on eighty percent of ''Beyonc<U+00E9>''.<ref name=boots>{{cite news|last=Greene|first=Jason|title=Beyonc<U+00E9>'s Muse|url=http://pitchfork.com/features/articles/9309-beyonces-muse/|accessdate=March 17, 2014|publisher=Pitchfork|date=January 21, 2014}}</ref>

Tourso designed ''Beyonc<U+00E9>''{{'}}s album cover. The original mock up was submitted in Puerto Rico where Tourso directed the video for "Heaven". Over the next three months, he considered over a hundred options for the cover, only to proceed with his original idea. He was inspired by the cover of [[Metallica]]'s [[Metallica (album)|1991 eponymous fifth album]] to create a bold statement, specifically to deviate from a "beauty shot" of Beyonc<U+00E9> which he felt would be expected. Tourso used a font similar to boxing-match placards to represent abrasive masculinity; which was contrasted by the greyish-pink font which he described as "a subversion of femininity".<ref name=atlantic>{{cite news|last1=Kornhaber|first1=Spencer|title=Beyonc<U+00E9>'s 'Flawless': The Full Story|url=http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2014/06/the-full-story-of-beyonces-flawless/373480/|accessdate=July 5, 2014|work=[[The Atlantic]]|date=June 26, 2014}}</ref>

It's all about the single, and the hype. It's so much that gets between the music and the art and the fans. I felt like, I don't want anybody to get the message, when my record is coming out.

The publication also noted the album's sexual tone and loose song-structure as distinct features.<ref name="telegraph"/> [[Jon Pareles]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' described the tracks as "steamy and sleek, full of erotic exploits and sultry vocals; every so often, for variety, they turn vulnerable, compassionate or pro-feminist".

[[Pitchfork Media]] writer Carrie Battan concludes it is "her most explicit and sonically experimental music to date, exploring sounds and ideas at the grittier margins of popular music".<ref name="pitchfork"/> ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]''{{'}}s Anupa Mistry felt it was Beyonc<U+00E9>'s best album and "more textured than its predecessors in both sound and content". Mistry also believed the album signified her evolvement from "diva-pop R&B [...] into a different lane, albeit subtly and gracefully".<ref name="spin"/> Andy Kellman of [[AllMusic]] called the album "a career highlight" and "her most entertaining and sexually explicit work, yet substantive in every respect.".<ref name="allmusic"/> Nick Catucci, writer for ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', found the singer indulging in "clashing impulses<U+2014>between strength and escape, megapop and fresh sounds, big messages and resonant lyrics".<ref name="Entertainment Weekly"/> Evan Rytlewski of the ''[[The A.V.

Mof Gimmers who reviewed the album for ''[[The Quietus]]'' was fond of the confidence displayed on ''Beyonc<U+00E9>'', calling it "a bold, expansive body of work" and "one of the strongest albums of the year".<ref>{{cite news|last1=Gimmers|first1=Mof|title=Reviews: Beyonc<U+00E9> <U+2013> Beyonc<U+00E9>|url=http://thequietus.com/articles/14122-beyonce-review|accessdate=July 28, 2014|work=[[The Quietus]]|date=December 14, 2013}}</ref> [[PopMatters]]' David Amidon praised the album's honest, albeit highly sexual nature.
