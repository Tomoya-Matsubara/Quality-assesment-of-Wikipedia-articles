The '''North-West Frontier Province''' (NWFP) ([[Urdu]]: '''<U+0634><U+0645><U+0627><U+0644> <U+0645><U+063A><U+0631><U+0628><U+06CC> <U+0633><U+0631><U+062D><U+062F><U+06CC> <U+0635><U+0648><U+0628><U+06C1>''') is the smallest in size of the [[Subdivisions of Pakistan|four provinces]] of [[Pakistan]] and is home to the [[Pashtuns]] (Pakhtoons). Neighbouring regions include [[Afghanistan]] to the west and north, and the [[Northern Areas, Pakistan|Northern Areas]] and [[Kashmir]] to the northeast and east. The [[Federally Administered Tribal Areas, Pakistan|Federally Administered Tribal Areas]] form a buffer between the NWFP and [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Baluchistan]]. [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]] and [[Islamabad Capital Territory]] are to the south and east. The principal language is [[Pashto language|Pashto]] and the provincial capital is [[Peshawar]]. Some Pashtuns refer to the province as '''[[Pakhtunkhwa]]''' ('''<U+067E><U+069A><U+062A><U+0648><U+0646><U+062E><U+0648><U+0627><U+0647>''') which means ''"Pashtun Area"'' in [[Pashto]], while the province is sometimes referred to as '''Sarhad''' ('''<U+0633><U+0631><U+062D><U+062F>''') in [[Urdu]]. 

== Geography ==
Most of NWFP is located on the [[Iranian plateau]] and/or [[Eurasian landplate]], while peripheral eastern regions are located near the [[Indian subcontinent]] and this has led to seismic activity in the past (see [[2005 Pakistan earthquake|Kashmir Quake]]).[http://www.peakbagger.com/range.aspx?rid=43] The famous [[Khyber Pass]] links the province to Afghanistan, while the [[Kohalla Bridge]] in [[Circle Bakote]] is a major crossing point over the [[Jhelum River|Jhelum river]] in the east. The province has an area of [[1 E10 m<U+00B2>|74,521]] [[square kilometre|km<U+00B2>]] and its districts include [[Hazara Division]], home to the town of [[Havelian]], the western starting point of the [[Karakoram Highway]]. The capital and largest city of the province is [[Peshawar]] and other main cities include [[Nowshera]], [[Mardan]], [[Mansehra]], [[Charsadda]], Ayubia, Nathia Gali and [[Abbottabad]]. The province's main districts include [[Dera Ismail Khan]], [[Kohistan|Kohat]], [[Bannu (district)|Bannu]], [[Peshawar]], and [[Hazara Division]].The region varies in topography from dry rocky areas in the south to forests and green plains in the north. The climate can be extreme with intensely hot summers to freezing cold winters. Despite these extremes in weather, agriculture remains important and viable in the area. The hilly terrain of [[Swat (Pakistan)|Swat]], [[Kalam]],[[Upper Dir]], [[Naran]] and [[Kaghan]] is renowned for its beauty and attracts a great many tourists from neighbouring regions and from around the world. Swat-Kalam is also termed 'a piece of [[Switzerland]]' as there are many landscape similarities between it and the mountainous terrain of Switzerland. 

The chai-khanas of [[Peshawar]]'s Old City allow visitors to witness the multicultural inhabitants in a relaxed setting. The Khyber Bazaar, Qissa Kahani Bazaar and other parts of Peshawar can remind visitors of an [[Arabian Nights]] tale. 

The [[Takht-i-Bahi]] is perhaps the most impressive Buddhist ruin in the province and dates back to the 1st century BCE.

It covers an area of 74,521 km<U+00B2>. According to the 1998 census, the total population of N.W.F.P. was approximately 14 million out of whom 52% are males and 48% females. The density of population is 187 per km<U+00B2> and the intercensal change of population is of about 30%. Geographically the province could be divided into two zones: the northern one extending from the ranges of the [[Hindu Kush]] to the borders of Peshawar basin; and the southern one extending from Peshawar to the Derajat basin. The northern zone is cold and snowy in winters with heavy rainfall and pleasant summers with the exception of Peshawar basin, which is hot in summer and cold in winter. It has moderate rainfall. The southern zone is arid with hot summers and relatively cold winters and scantly rainfall. Its climate varies from very cold (Chitral in the north) to very hot in places like D.I. Khan. The major rivers that criss cross the province are Kabul River, Swat River, Chitral River, Panjgora River, Bara River, Karam River, Gomal River and Zob River.

Its snow-capped peaks and lush green valleys of unusual beauty attract tourists and mountaineers from far and wide while its art and architecture no less known than the historic [[Khyber Pass]]. Once the cradle of [[Gandhara]] civilization, the area is now known for its devout Muslims who zealously guard their religion and culture and the way of life that they have been following for centuries.

==Climate==
The [[climate]] of North-West Frontier province varies immensely for a region of its size, most of the many climate types found in Pakistan.

===Chitral District===
The north, comprising Chitral District, has a typically continental steppe climate, with average annual [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] ranging from 100[[millimetre|mm]] per year in the far north to 23 inches in Drosh in the south. Most of this precipitation from frontal cloudbands during the winter and heavy [[thunderstorm]]s in the spring. Of Chitral's average 16.5 inches of rainfall per year, 350 mm falls from December to May. At high elevations in the Hindukush, [[snow]]fall can be much heavier than this and consequently large [[glaciers]] are a prominent feature of the landscape. snow also cuts off even Chitral town from the outside world for most of the year. Temperatures in the valleys vary from 86 <U+00B0>F in July to as low as 32 <U+00B0>F in January.

===Dir, Swat and Hazara===
Further south, in the districts of [[Dir]], [[Swat (Pakistan)|Swat]] and [[Hazara]], the climate becomes more typical of the Indian subcontinent, although a considerable proportion of the annual precipitation still comes from frontal cloudbands during the winter months.

The combination of a short but powerful (owing to orography) summer monsoon with frequent winter cloudbands gives a bimodal rainfall regime in central parts of NWFP. Dir and Hazara districts are some of the wettest places in Pakistan: annual rainfall at Dir averages 58 inches, of which 400 mm falls during the summer monsoon from July to September and twice that amount during the winter rainy season from December to April. At [[Abbottabad]] further east, the annual rainfall averages about 47 inches, but as much as 25 inches falls during the south-west monsoon. In Swat, rather more sheltered, the annual rainfall averages around 33 inches, with about 17 inches expected between June and September. A similar climate to that of Dir, though drier, prevails in a small area around [[Parachinar]] in the Federally Adminsitered Tribal Areas.

In all areas October and November are the driest months with rainfalls generally under 30 mm per month except in the most exposed areas.

Temperatures in this region are somewhat warmer than in [[Chitral]], and even at 1,200 metres in Abbottabad the heat and humidity can be oppressive during the monsoon season. In winter, most of Swat receives significant snowfall, but in Hazara temperatures usually are around 41 <U+00B0>F.

===Southern North-West Frontier Province===
This region, south of the Himalaya/Hindukush foothills, has the typically hot and dry climate of much of Pakistan. Temperatures in summer are quite oppressively hot, and in the south around Mardan temperatures of 113 <U+00B0>F are not uncommon, whilst in Peshawar 40 <U+00B0>C is par for the course in summer. In winter, however, this region is both warmer and generally drier than the rest of NWFP, with temperatures being around 62 <U+00B0>F in Peshawar and over 68 <U+00B0>F in the extreme south of the province. Nights, however, can still be quite cold during the winter.

Southern NWFP experiences little (and very erratic) monsoonal rain, with Peshawar and Dera Ismail Khan both averaging around 4.5 inches of rain in July and August and almost nothing in June or September. Moreover, in many years no summer rain of significance occurs. In winter, rainfall usually peaks in March but Peshawar averages less than 10 inches between December and May and Dera Ismail Khan less than 4.5 inches. On certain mountain slopes such as around [[Kohat]], winter rainfall may predominate, though this is unpredictable

The NWFP has an estimated population of roughly 21 million that does not include more than 3 million [[Afghanistan|Afghan]] refugees and their descendants in the province.[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9056228][http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/home/opendoc.pdf?tbl=SUBSITES&page=SUBSITES&id=434fdc702]

The major language spoken in the NWFP is [[Pashto]] and most of its residents are [[Pashtun]]s, especially in the lowlands and the southern areas of the NWFP. The main Pashtun tribes in the South are the [[Yousafzai|Yusufzai]], [[Khattak]], [[Marwat]], [[Afridi]],[[Shinwari]], [[Orakzai]], [[Bangash]], [[Mahsud]], [[Mohmand]], [[Wazir]], and [[Gandapur]] and some smaller tribes. Further north, the prominent Pashtun tribes are, [[Swati]], [[Tareen]],[[Tanoli]], [[Jadoon]] and [[Mashwani]].

The mountainous extreme north regions of the province is also home to diverse ethnic groups and languages, such as [[Khowar]], [[Hindko]], Kohistani, [[Shina]], [[Torwali]], [[Kashmiri]], [[Kalasha of Chitral|Kalasha]] and Kalami. 

In addition, Afghan refugees, although predominantly Pashtun (including the [[Ghilzai]] and [[Durrani]] tribes), include hundreds of thousands of [[Persian language|Persian]]-speaking [[Tajiks]] and [[Hazara]]s as well other smaller groups found throughout the province.

Nearly all of the inhabitants of the NWFP are [[Muslim]] with a [[Sunni]] majority and significant minority of [[Shia]]s and [[Ismaili]]s. Many of the [[Kalasha of Chitral|Kalasha]] of Southern Chitral still retain their ancient [[Animist]]/[[Shamanist]] religion.

==History==
===Ancient History===
Since ancient times, the region had been invaded by numerous groups including the [[Persians]], [[Greeks]], [[Scythians]], [[Kushans]], [[Huns]], [[Arabs]], [[Turkic peoples|Turks]], [[Mongols]], [[Mughals]], [[Sikhs]], and the [[United Kingdom|British]]. Between 2000 and 1500 BC ,Aryans split off into an Iranian branch, represented by the [[Pakhtuns]] who dominated most of the region, and various [[Dardic languages|Dardic]] peoples which came to populate much of the north. 

The Vale of Peshawar was home to the Kingdom of [[Gandhara]] from around the 6th century BC and later ancient [[Peshawar]] became a capital of the [[Kushan Empire]]. The region was visited by such notable historical figures as [[Darius II]], [[Alexander the Great]], [[Marco Polo]], [[Mountstuart Elphinstone]], and [[Winston Churchill]], among others.

The region was, in ancient times, a major centre of [[Buddhism]] as attested by recent archaeological and hermeneutic evidence. [[Kanishka]], a prominent [[Kushan]] ruler was one of the prominent Buddhist kings. 

"The region of Gandhara has long been known as a major centre of Buddhist art and culture around the beginning of the Christian era. But until recently, the Buddhist literature of this region was almost entirely lost. Now, within the last decade, a large corpus of Gandharan manuscripts dating from as early as the 1st century A.D. has come to light and is being studied and published by scholars at the University of Washington. These scrolls, written on birch-bark in the Gandharan language and the [[Kharosthi]] script, are the oldest surviving Buddhist literature, which has hitherto been known to us only from later and modern Buddhist canons. They also institute a missing link between original South Asian Buddhism and the Buddhism of East Asia, which was exported primarily from Gandhara along the Silk Roads through Central Asia and thence to China".
:Lecture: " Rediscovering the lost Buddhist literature of Gandhara" by Prof. Richard Salomon, University of Washington, Seattle at Stanford University (2005)

The Hindu [[Shahi]] Kings
 
Up until the advent of Islam, the [[NWFP]] was ruled by the [[Shahi]] kings. When [[Hs<U+00FC>an-tsang]] visited the region early in the 7th century CE, the Kabul valley region was ruled by a Hindu Kshatriya king, who is identified as the Shahi Khingal, and whose name has been found in an inscription found in Gardez.

The Hindu Shahi kings of Kabul and Gandhara may have had links to some ruling families in neighbouring Kashmir and other areas to the east. The Shahis, though Hindu, were rulers of a predominantly Buddhist and Zoroastrian population and were thus patrons of numerous faiths, and various artifacts and coins from their rule have been found that display their multicultural domain. The last Shahi rulers, Jayapal, Anandapal and Trilochanpal, fought invading Muslim Turks from Central Asia and were gradually defeated.

===Arrival of Islam===
Buddhism remained prominent in the region until the [[Muslim]] Arabs and Turks conquered the area before the 2nd millennium AD. Over the centuries local Pakhtun and Dardic tribes were converted to Islam, while retaining some local traditions such as [[Pashtunwali]] or the Pakhtun code of honour. The NWFP became part of larger Islamic empires including the [[Ghaznavid Empire]] and the empire of [[Muhammad of Ghor]] and was nominally controlled by the [[Delhi Sultanate]] and [[Ilkhanate|Ilkhantate Empire]] of the [[Mongols]]. The Muslim technocrats, bureaucrats, soldiers, traders, scientists, architects, teachers, theologians and Sufis flocked from the rest of the Muslim world to Islamic [[Sultanate]] in [[South Asia]] including NWFP.

The NWFP was an important borderland that was often contested by the [[Mughals]] and [[Safavids]] of Persia. During the reign of the Mughal emperor [[Aurangzeb]], the NWFP required formidable military forces to control and the emergence of Pakhtun nationalism through the voice of local warrior poet [[Khushal Khan Khattak]] united some of the tribes against the various empires around the region. The area, as a predominantly Pakhtun region, merged following a ''[[loya jirga]]'' with the [[Durrani Empire]] founded by [[Ahmad Shah Durrani]] in 1747, but the areas now known as NWFP were largerly autonomous.

===Sethana family===
{{Cleanup|February 2007}}
Sethana family<U+2019>s influence started with the advent of their fore father Hazrat Pir Baba Syed Ali Tirmzi in Swat. From 1820, Sethana became place of resistance against the Sikhs and fight continued for 26 years till 1846. In fact, Sethana family dominated the political scene in Usafzai area for 200 years. In 1824, Maharaja Ranjit Singh attacked Sethana itself with 1,00000 soldiers. Syed Akbar Shah was born in 1793- ruled Swat till 1857. His total period of rule on Hazara and Swat lasted for 12 years. His capital was at Ghalegai in Abakhel area of Swat. His great grand father Syed Zaman Shah went from Buner to Sethana and after that the family extended from Buner, Malka and Swat to Sethana. In 1841, the great Indus flood destroyed Sethana followed by burning and destruction of Sethana by Sikhs and British and ultimately in 1973 it submerged under Tarbela Dam Lake. In 1852, Syed Akbar Shah fought the British at Malakand. In 1856, a mutiny supported by Nawab of Dir was crushed. In 1856, five hundred British native Infantry soldiers defected to Badshah Sahib Syed Akbar Shah but Akhund Sahib was against them and recommended their departure from Swat. He died at the age of 70 on 11th May 1857 on the day of mutiny in India. The British passed this remark <U+201C> Today we have received bad news of mutiny but the good news is that Syed Akbar Shah has died otherwise the shape of the mutiny would have been different.<U+201D>Syed Ahmed Shahid Brevly was given total protection by Syed Akbar Shah and his family and even after the death of Syed Ahmed Shahid his disciples were given protection in Sethana.  Syeds of Sethana suffered at the hands of Sikhs and later on British for a very long time. They lost their State and property time and again for the cause of Islam.
2.His son Shehzada Syed Mubarik Shah became the ruler and fought the forces of General Chamberlain gallantly in 1863 at Ambela. He could rule only for one year. At this stage, Akhund Sahib also started conspiring against the family. Infact Akhund Sahib during the life of Syed Akbar Shah started saying that he would not support the family after the death of Badshah Sahib keeping in mind the circumstances and future planning for take over by his family. By this time he had amassed huge properties and created influence by helping public through Badshah Sahib at the same times giving full support to him. The famous Enfield Rifle was used in Sethana for the first time in Subcontinent by the British forces.     
3. Syed Abdul Jabbar Shah. His father Syed Mehmood Shah was killed by Hassan Zai tribes. When he was 6 months old his cousin Feroz Shah came from Malka, attacked Sethana and killed all family male members in 1878. He was removed by a female servant and taken to a nearby village Kia and given protection by Ghulam Khel tribe. At a very young age, he left for India and lived with his stepbrother who was borne and lived in Lukhnow since his child hood. In Azam Garh, he studied with a Persian scholar Maulvi Qamaruddin, Maulvi Nazir ud Din and Maulvi Kabir Ullah who were  Arabic and Persian teachers in Banaras. He came back and again went for studies in 1890. In 1897, he took part in Landakai war . In 1899, Nawab of Amb Akram khan appointed him as his Minister at a very young age. After the death of Nawab, his son Khan Zaman Khan became ruler. He married the daughter of Nawab of Amb in 1907. From childhood, he developed love for Islam and history mainly because of his family background. He had photographic memory, whatever, he studied once, he never forgot till his death. He was Hafiz-e-Quran and wrote many books mainly on the history of Pakhtoons (Al Hibrat, Bani Israel and Four Hundred Years old history of Frontier). He went on foot right up to Qundoos north Afghanistan in 1905 to confirm his ancestral history. According to Sir Olaf Caroe, <U+201C> he was an authority on the history of Pathans.<U+201D> In 1903, he went to Delhi and met a very respected personality and Saint Shah Abdul Kher Mujaddi. In 1908, he re-captured Sethana with the help of Nawab of Amb and constructed Fort and house. In 1908, he married the daughter of ruler of Bokhara who had come to Abbottabad after revolution via Afghanistan with the help of Amir Abdul Rehan of Kabul.
He ruled Swat from 28 April 1914 to 1918. His capital was at Niphikhel area Bandi Bala. Immediately after taking over  as ruler, he organized an Army and proper income tax in Islamic way. Shariat law was to be followed. The Army was properly paid monthly pay.
After 2 years in 1916, Mian Gul  Abdul Wadood CAST (Gujar) mutinied but was arrested. He pardoned him and Mian Gul fought under his command against Nawab of Dir.He gave in writing on Holy Quran that he would never rise against him.  His written  statement of request for Pardon duly stamped is still available. He was sent for Hajj but on his return, he conspired with the British and with their active help overthrew him. British have confirmed their help against him and their animosity against Syed family in number of  books. In 1912, Sir Sahibzada Abdul Qayum requested him for help for Islamia College. He got Rs. 1,00,000/- from Nawab Khan Zaman Khan and gave it to him. Again in 1939, he was exiled by the British to Hyderabad Deccan. The Nizam appointed him as his Defense Minister and remained there till 1945. While he was in Hyderabad, he was again asked by Sahibzada Sahib for help for Islamia College. He again got Rs. 1,50,000/- from Nizam and sent it to him. Mian Gul<U+2019>s status as ruler was accepted in 1926, although he was supported and installed by the British.

===British Era===
[[Image:Shabkadr_Fort_outside_Peshawar_attacked_by_tribesmen.jpg|thumb|250px|Afghan tribesmen attacking the British-held Shabkadr Fort outside Peshawar in 1897]]

A series of conflicts known as the [[Anglo-Afghan wars]] during the imperialist [[Great Game]] between the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Russia]], led to the eventual dismemberment of Afghanistan. The annexation of the region led to the demarcation of the [[Durand Line]] and administration as part of British South Asia. The Durand line is a term for the poorly marked 1,519 mile border between Afghanistan and Pakistan. 
After fighting in two wars against Afghans, the British succeeded in 1893 in imposing the Durand line, dividing Afghanistan and what was then [[British India]]. Named for Sir Mortimer Durand, the foreign secretary of the British colonial government, it was agreed upon by representatives of both governments. While the Afghan side greatly resented the border and viewed it as a temporary development, the British viewed it as being a permanent settlement. One of the two representatives of the Afghan government was the revered Ahmadi Sahibzada Abdul Latif of Khost. The border was drawn intentionally to cut through the [[Pakhtun]] tribes.

The British, who had captured most of rest of South Asia without significant problems, faced a number of difficulties here. The first war with the [[Pathans]] resulted in a devastating defeat, with just one soldier coming back alive (out of a total of 14,800 people). Unable to enforce their writ in the region, they changed tactics and played a game of [[divide and rule]], installing puppet [[Pashtun]] rulers as well as dividing the Pashtuns through artificially created regions and ruling indirectly so as to reduce the chance of confrontation.

The province was formed on November 9, 1901 as a Chief Commissioner province. The Chief Commissioner was the chief executive of the province. He ran the administration with the help of his principal advisers and civil servants better known as judicial and revenue commissioners. 

The formal inauguration of the province took place five and half months later on April 26, 1902 on the occasion of the historical "Darbar" in Shahi Bagh in Peshawar held by [[Lord Curzon]]. The province of NWFP then comprised only five districts. They were [[Peshawar]], [[Hazara]], [[Kohat]], [[Bannu]], and [[Dera Ismail Khan]]. The [[Malakand]], which consisted of three princely states of [[Dir]], [[Swat]], [[Chitral]] was included in it. The NWFP also included the four tribal administered agencies, [[Khyber]], [[Khurram]], North [[Waziristan]], and South [[Waziristan]] (now seven). The first chief commissioner of the NWFP was Harold Deane. A strong administrator, he was followed by Ross-Keppel in 1908, whose contribution as a political officer was widely known amongst the tribal/frontier people. 

The NWFP was raised to a full-fledged Governor province in 1935. The decision was actually made in the Round Table Conference held in 1931. It was agreed upon in the conference that the NWFP would be raised to a governor province with its own Legislative Council. Therefore, on January 25, 1932, the Viceroy inaugurated NWFP Legislative Council. The first provincial elections were held in 1937 and independent candidate and noted landlord Sahibzada Abdul Qayyum Khan was elected as the provinces first Chief Minister.

===After Independence===
During the early 20th century the so-called Red Shirts led by [[Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan]] agitated through non-violence for the rights of Pakhtun areas. Following independence, the NWFP voted to join [[Pakistan]] in a referendum in 1947. However, Afghanistan's ''[[loya jirga]]'' of 1949 declared the Durand Line invalid. During the 1950s, Afghanistan supported a secessionist movement but failed because the movement did not gain substantial support from the people living in NWFP.

[[President Yahya Khan]], in 1969 abolished the one unit scheme and added [[Swat (Pakistan)|Swat]], [[Dir]], [[Chitral]] and [[Kohistan]] to the new borders.

The issue kept Pakistan and Afghanistan at odds for decades until the [[Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan]] in 1979. Following the invasion over 5 million Afghan refugees poured into Pakistan, most residing in the NWFP. During the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, the NWFP served as a major base for supplying the [[Mujahideen]] who fought the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]s during the 1980s. 

The NWFP remained heavily influenced by events in Afghanistan and the civil war led to the rise of the [[Taliban]], which had emerged in the border region between Afghanistan and Pakistan as a formidable political force that nearly took-over all of Afghanistan. Following the terrorist attacks of [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11, 2001]], the NWFP became a frontline region again as part of the US-led [[War on Terror]].

==Government==
The [[Provincial Assembly of North-West Frontier Province]] is unicameral and consists of 124 seats of which 2% are reserved for non-Muslims and 17% for women only.

==Economy==
After suffering for decades due to the fallout of Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan, today they are again being targeted for totally a reverse situation. Agriculture remains important and the main cash crops include wheat, maize, rice, sugar beets, as well as various fruits are grown in the province. Some manufacturing and high tech investments in Peshawar has helped improve job prospects for many locals, while trade in the province involves nearly every product known to man, as the bazaars in the province are renowned throughout Pakistan. Unemployment has been reduced due to establishment of industrial zones.

Numerous workshops throughout the province support the manufacture of small arms and weapons of various types.

The province accounts for atleast 78% of the marble production in Pakistan. [http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/IW3P/IB/2006/05/23/000012009_20060523095241/Rendered/PDF/354991PK0rev0pdf.pdf]

==Education==
The trend towards higher education is rapidly increasing in the province and the NWFP is home to Pakistan's foremost engineering university (Ghulam Ishaq Khan Institute), which is located in Topi, a town in Swabi district. The [[University of Peshawar]] is also a notable institution of higher learning. The [[Frontier Post]] is perhaps the province's best-known newspaper and addresses many of the various issues facing the local population.

==Folk Music==
Pashto folk music is popular in NWFP and has a rich tradition going back hundreds of years. The main instruments are the Rubab, mangey and harmonium.

Khowar folk music is popular in Chitral and northern Swat. The tunes of Khowar music are very different from those of Pashto and the main instrument is the Chitrali Sitar.

A form of band music composed of clarinets (surnai) and drums is popular in Chitral. It is played at polo matches and dances. The same form of band music is also played in the neighbouring [[Northern Areas]].

== Social Issues ==
The NWFP continues to have an image problem. Even within Pakistan it is regarded as a "radical state" due to the rise of Islamist parties to power in the province and purported support for the remnants of the [[Taliban]] who are believed by some to be hiding in the province. The plagues of sectarianism, terrorism and insurrection have not been a problem in the North-West Frontier and the local economy has met with significant gains in spite of hosting millions of Afghan refugees, many of who have been integrated into the local society.

Pashtuns within the NWFP have sought to rename the province ''[[Pakhtunkhwa]]'', which translates to "Land of the Pakhtuns" in [[Pashto]]. This has been opposed by the people of the mountainous northern regions of NWFP, many of who are non-Pashtuns.
