The team planned to begin play in 2010, until cracks in the concrete structure in the south stands of Frank Clair Stadium led to the demolition of those stands; the league later set a date of 2013 for the team's debut, but lawsuits forced the delay of construction on the stadium to be pushed back even further.<ref name=delays/>

This will be the third CFL team to play in the city.  The [[Ottawa Rough Riders]], formed in 1876, was a founding member of the CFL in 1958 and played until 1996.  A new Ottawa franchise was formed as the "Renegades" in 2002, and lasted until the end of the 2005 season.<ref name="ctv" />

==History==
The [[Ottawa Renegades]] abruptly ceased operations prior to the [[2006 CFL season]]. The league liquidated the Renegades roster in a dispersal draft and placed the Ottawa CFL franchise up for sale with the intent of eventually returning to the city.

On March 25, 2008, an ownership group led by [[Ottawa 67's]] owner [[Jeff Hunt]] was awarded the franchise. The team will play at a remodelled [[Frank Clair Stadium]] now called TD Place Stadium, and will begin play in 2014 if construction remains on schedule.<ref name="CFL return">http://www.torontosun.com/sports/football/2010/06/29/14551341.html CFL will return to Ottawa</ref><ref name="Lansdowne passes">http://www.obj.ca/Local/2010-06-29/article-1426235/Lansdowne-passes-by-15-9-margin;-city-eyes-CFL-return/1 Lansdowne passes by 15-9 margin; city eyes CFL return</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cfl.ca/article/cfl-in-ottawa-on-track-for-the-2014-season |title=CFL in Ottawa on track for the 2014 season |work=Official Site of the Canadian Football League |publisher=CFL.ca |date=10 October 2012 |accessdate=2014-04-16}}</ref> While in 2008 the franchise was conditionally awarded the right to host the [[102nd Grey Cup|2014 Grey Cup]] game,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tsn.ca/cfl/story/?id=256724&lid=sublink03&lpos=headlines_main |title=Ottawa conditionally awarded 2014 Grey Cup |accessdate=November 21, 2008|date=November 21, 2008 |publisher=[[The Sports Network]]}}</ref> Jeff Hunt has indicated that he would like to postpone the game for a few years to give his franchise a better chance to play in the championship game<ref name="CFL return"/> and after lawsuits and delays, the stadium renovations will not be completed until 2014.<ref name=delays>{{cite news |work=CTV.ca |title=Lansdowne won't be ready for CFL football until 2014 |date=August 12, 2011 |url=http://ottawa.ctv.ca/servlet/an/local/CTVNews/20110812/OTT_Lansdowne_110812/20110812/?hub=OttawaHome |accessdate=August 13, 2011}}</ref> Hosting the Grey Cup is a condition included in the agreement giving Hunt control of the franchise.<ref name=garrioch64>{{cite news|last=Garrioch|first= Bruce |date=June 4, 2012|url=http://www.ottawasun.com/2012/06/04/no-grey-cup-for-ottawa-in-2014|newspaper=The Ottawa Sun |title=No Grey Cup for Ottawa in 2014}}.

Concurrently, [[Ottawa Senators]] owner [[Eugene Melnyk]] had announced plans to bid for a [[Major League Soccer]] franchise to play in Ottawa and to build a [[Ottawa Soccer Stadium|new soccer specific stadium]] near the Senators' [[Scotiabank Place]] in support of these plans.  Depending on the stadium's design it could be used by a CFL team instead of the aging Frank Clair Stadium.  However, the CFL and MLS groups have not indicated that they are co-ordinating their plans.  Furthermore, municipal officials have questioned whether the city could support both a CFL and an MLS franchise.<ref>{{cite news|last=Gordon |first=Sean |url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/LAC.20080917.SOCCER17/TPStory/Sports |title=globeandmail.com: Sports |publisher=Globe and Mail |date=September 17, 2008 |accessdate=November 24, 2008}}{{dead link|date=June 2013}}</ref>

In April 2009, the staff of the City of Ottawa presented a report to Council on the merits of the Soccer Stadium and Lansdowne proposals. The city held public hearings based on the report, which questioned the necessity of the spending, but gave a slight edge to the Lansdowne proposal. Councillors attempted to find out whether the SSE group would support sharing their stadium with a planned CFL franchise, but the SSE group rejected the possibility. On April 22, 2009, the City of Ottawa Council chose the Lansdowne Live proposal over the SSE proposal as its choice for an outdoor stadium. Over the next several months, negotiations were made leading up to August 26, where a presentation was made to Ottawa City Council would decide the fate of football in Ottawa in the foreseeable future.

On November 12 and 13, City Council held a public debate to discuss what should be done with the area at Lansdowne Park. Guest speakers included [[Mark Cohon]] and former [[Ottawa Rough Riders|Rough Riders]] [[Jock Climie]] and [[Mark Kosmos]] who presented their case as to why Lansdowne Live was an important contributor to the city of Ottawa.<ref>{{cite news|last=Garrioch |first=Bruce |url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Football/CFL/News/2009/11/11/11716031-sun.html |title=Lansdowne proposal Ottawa's last shot |publisher=Slam Sports |date=November 11, 2009 |accessdate=November 16, 2009}}</ref> The following Monday, on November 16, it was reported that Ottawa City Council had voted 15<U+2013>9 in favour of plans to redevelop Lansdowne Park to house a CFL team.<ref>{{cite news|last=Naylor |first=Dave |url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/cfls-return-to-ottawa-moves-one-step-closer/article1365927/ |title=CFL's return to Ottawa moves one step closer |publisher=Globe and Mail |date=November 17, 2009 |accessdate=November 16, 2009}}</ref> The Hunt Group had until June 2010 to sort out the details of the redevelopment with construction likely to begin in the spring of 2011.

On December 6, 2012, the CFL opened voting for the name of the team, up until December 16, 2012, on www.nameourteams.com. It was speculated that the team would be called the Rush, but this was later debunked.<ref>{{cite web|author=nurun.com |url=http://www.brantfordexpositor.ca/2012/12/21/ottawa-cfl-team-wont-be-called-rush |title=Team won't be called Rush &#124; Sports &#124; Brantford Expositor |publisher=Brantfordexpositor.ca |date=2012-12-21 |accessdate=2013-06-09}}</ref> The Rush name was nonetheless included in a list of five potential names (Nationals, Voyageurs, RedBlacks, and Raftsmen being the others) for the team in a focus group led by the team's owners in January 2013.<ref>Baines, Tim (January 23, 2013).

==2013 CFL Draft==

One year before the Ottawa franchise hits the field for the [[2014 CFL season]] they were allowed to draft four NCAA junior [[Redshirt (college sports)|redshirts]] (players who would participate in the [[2013 NCAA Division I FBS football season|2013 NCAA football season]]). The draft took place May 6, 2013. Ottawa had the last pick in the first 4 rounds of the draft (9, 18, 27, 36 overall selections). They selected [[Nolan MacMillan]] from [[Iowa Hawkeyes football|Iowa]], [[Connor Williams (Canadian football)|Connor Williams]] from [[Utah State Aggies football|Utah State]], [[Kalonji Kashama]] from [[Eastern Michigan Eagles football|Eastern Michigan]] and [[Tyler Digby]] from [[Robert Morris Colonials football|Robert Morris]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ottawacitizen.com/sports/Ottawa+picks+four+draft/8345594/story.html |title=Ottawa picks four in draft |newspaper=Ottawa Citizen}}{{dead link|date=April 2014}}</ref>

==Expansion Draft==
{{Main|2013 CFL Expansion Draft}}
The 2013 CFL Expansion Draft was a three-round [[CFL draft]] held on December 16, 2013 which assign players from existing CFL teams to the new Ottawa team. The structure of the draft was announced on January 19, 2011, which described one round for selecting import players and two rounds for selecting non-import players.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cfl.ca/article/expansion-draft-plan-approved |title=Expansion Draft plan approved &#124; CFL.ca &#124; Official Site of the Canadian Football League |publisher=CFL.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-06-09}}</ref> Additionally, if the Ottawa franchise begins play in 2014 they will be given the first pick in every round of the 2014 CFL Draft.

Ottawa selected three players from each of the [[Canadian Football League#Active teams|eight existing teams]] for a total of 24 players. Ottawa was allowed to select eight import players and 16 non-import players with [[quarterback]]s, [[Placekicker|kickers]] and [[punter (football)|punter]]s eligible within their respective import/non-import categories. Ottawa was permitted to select a maximum of two quarterbacks and one kicker/punter, but not select any two of these three players from the same team. The [[CFL Commissioner]] is authorized to resolve any dispute related to player eligibility for the Expansion Draft process.

The selections were announced live at cfl.ca on December 16, 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cfl.ca/video/index/id/93869/autostart/true |title=Expansion Draft: Round 1 Selections |work=Official Site of the Canadian Football League |publisher=CFL.ca |date=2013-12-16 |accessdate=2014-04-16}}</ref>
