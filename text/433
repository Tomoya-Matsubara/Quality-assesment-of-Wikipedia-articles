'''''Moon Museum''''' is a small [[ceramic]] [[Wafer (electronics)|wafer]] three-quarters of an inch by half an inch in size,<ref name="History"> [http://www.pbs.org/opb/historydetectives/diyinv/2010/06/diy-moon-museum.html Who is John F.?], ''[[History Detectives]]'', [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]], Season 8, Episode 1, June 7, 2010. Accessed July 14, 2010</ref> containing artworks by six prominent artists from the late 1960s. The artists with works in the "museum" are [[Robert Rauschenberg]], [[David Novros]], [[John Chamberlain (sculptor)|John Chamberlain]], [[Claes Oldenburg]], [[Forrest Myers]], and [[Andy Warhol]].<ref name="History" /> 

This wafer was supposedly covertly attached to a leg of the [[Apollo Lunar Module|Intrepid landing module]], and subsequently left on the moon during [[Apollo 12]].<ref name="UCSD"> [http://blog.ucsd.edu/artslib/2008/03/01/secret-museum-on-the-moons-surface/ Secret Museum On The Moon<U+2019>s Surface].

==History==
[[File:Moon museum nyt.jpg| thumb| left| Image of the Moon Museum from the original '' [[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' article]]

The concept for ''Moon Museum'' was brainstormed by Forrest "Frosty" Myers. He stated that "My idea was to get six great artists together and make a tiny little museum that would be on the moon."<ref name="History" /> Myers attempted several times to get his project sanctioned by [[NASA]]. He claims the agency gave him the runaround and, Myers states, "They never said no, I just could not get them to say anything."<ref name="History" /> Instead of going through the official channels he was forced to take the back route and try to smuggle it on board.

Myers contacted [[Experiments in Art and Technology]] (E.A.T.), a non-profit group that was linking artists with engineers to create new works. Through E.A.T., Myers was introduced to some scientists from [[Bell Laboratories]], specifically [[Fred Waldhauer]]. Using techniques normally used to produce telephone circuits, the scientists etched the drawings Myers had gathered onto small ceramic wafers. Either 16 or 20 of these wafers were created,<ref name="History" /> with one going on the lunar lander and the rest, copies of the original, handed out to the artists and others involved in the project.<ref name="AOL">Moye, David.

June 17, 2010, Accessed July 14, 2010.</ref>

When NASA dithered whether the wafer would be allowed onto the module, Waldhauer devised another plan. Waldhauer knew a [[Grumman Aircraft]] engineer who was working on the Apollo 12 lander module, and he proved willing to place the wafer on it.<ref>[http://www.pbs.org/aboutpbs/news/20100607_historydetectivesandywarholartonmoon.html PBS' HISTORY DETECTIVES PUTS A QUESTION TO THE NATION: IS ANDY WARHOL<U+2019>S ART ON THE MOON?]. PBS. June 7, 2010. Accessed July 14, 2010</ref> Myers asked Waldhauer how he would know if the art actually made it onto the lander, and was told that the person who worked for Grumman would send him a [[telegram]] when the wafer was in place. At 3:35 p.m. on November 12, 1969, less than two days before Apollo 12 took off, Myers received a telegram at his house from [[Cape Canaveral]], [[Florida]] stating "YOUR ON' A.O.K. ALL SYSTEMS GO," and signed "JOHN F."<ref name="History" />

The existence of the work was not revealed until Myers informed ''[[The New York Times]]'' which ran an article on the story two days after Apollo 12 left the moon and two days before they splashed down in the Pacific Ocean.<ref name="greg">[http://greg.org/archive/2008/02/28/the_moon_museum.html Holy ^%$&!

There are six artworks located on the ceramic tile, each one in black and white only. Starting in the top center is a single line by [[Robert Rauschenberg]]. To its right is a black square with thin white lines intersecting, resembling a piece of circuitry, by David Novros. Below it is  [[John Chamberlain (sculptor)|John Chamberlain]]'s contribution, a template pattern which also resembles circuitry. In the lower middle is a geometric variation on [[Mickey Mouse]], by [[Claes Oldenburg]], a popular motif for the artist at that time. Myers created the work in the lower left, a computer-generated drawing of a "linked symbol" called "Interconnection". Finally, the last drawing in the upper left is by [[Andy Warhol]]. He created a stylized version of his initials which, when viewed at certain angles, can appear as a [[rocket ship]] or a crudely drawn [[penis]].<ref name="History" /><ref name="UCSD" /> "He was being the terrible bad boy." says Myers.<ref name="History" /> Warhol's work is covered by a thumb in the image often associated with  ''Moon Museum'', but other images with the drawing visible can be found.<ref name= "greg" />

Both John Chamberlain and Claes Oldenberg have confirmed through representatives that they contributed drawings to ''Moon Museum''. <ref name="AOL" />
