==History==
[[File:Ocean Village Marina.jpg|thumb|left|Ocean Village Marina, [[Gibraltar]]]]
Ocean Village Marina was formerly Sheppard's Marina, owned by H. Sheppard & Co.<ref>{{cite book|title=Around the World Rally|year=1993|publisher=Sheridan House, Inc|isbn= 9780924486470|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=k6yjmjlItIUC&pg=PA14&lpg=PA14&dq=Sheppard's+Marina,+Gibraltar&source=bl&ots=-3Xojm9dL7&sig=iTMprUMcvLQ9IWrlHKYpgW1wM4c&hl=en&sa=X&ei=y3wqUKCQIOj1ygGel4CYCg&ved=0CEgQ6AEwBDgo#v=onepage&q=Sheppard's%20Marina%2C%20Gibraltar&f=false|author=Cornell, Jimmy |edition=illustrated|accessdate=14 August 2012|page=14}}</ref> By 2004, the marina had been sold to Ocean Village Investments Ltd and demolition had commenced.<ref>{{cite news|title=Development of Sheppard's Marina, Gibraltar|url=http://www.yachtingmonthly.com/news/406870/development-of-sheppard-s-marina-gibraltar|accessdate=14 August 2012|newspaper=Yachting Monthly|date=1 June 2004|author=Toby Hodges}}</ref> The marina retained its original name, at least informally, for several years after the sale.

On 4 June 2012, the Ocean Village Marina hosted 161 vessels which formed the [[Gibraltar Diamond Jubilee Flotilla]], celebrating sixty years of the [[Elizabeth II|Queen's]] reign.<ref name=jubilee/> The [[flotilla]] took place one day after a similar event in [[London]] up the [[Thames]]. The festivities started officially with greetings from Gregory Butcher, founder of Ocean Village,<ref>{{cite news|title=Ocean Village Reaches New Heights|url=http://www.chronicle.gi/headlines_details.php?id=18302|accessdate=14 August 2012|newspaper=Gibraltar Chronicle|date=13 February 2010}}</ref> and Ros Astengo, event organiser of Ocean Village. The [[Gibraltar Port Authority]] addressed those assembled on the topic of safety, and made recommendations regarding precautions which ranged from sunscreen to the distance between vessels. The flotilla departed from the marina at midday, sailing from the western side of the runway, passing [[Europa Point]], and returning after reaching the eastern side of the runway. Boats up to {{convert|70|m|ft}} participated in the flotilla. Small boats led the flotilla, followed by power boats over {{convert|9|m|ft}}, and, finally, sailing vessels. The ''General Elliot'', a Gibraltar Port Authority vessel, was at the head of the flotilla, and was supported by other official vessels.<ref name=flotilla>{{cite web|title=Diamond Jubilee Flotilla|url=http://www.oceanvillage.gi/161-boats-sail-from-ocean-village-for-the-jubilee-flotilla/|publisher=Ocean Village|accessdate=14 August 2012}}</ref><ref name=jubilee>{{cite news|title=Be a part of history in the Gibraltar Diamond Jubilee Flotilla|url=http://homeandlifestyle.es/events-and-exhibitions/be-a-part-of-history-in-the-gibraltar-diamond-jubilee-flotilla/|accessdate=14 August 2012|newspaper=Home and Lifestyle Magazine|date=16 May 2012}}</ref>
