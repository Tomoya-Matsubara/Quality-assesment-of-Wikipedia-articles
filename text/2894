'''Mark Twain National Forest'''  ('''MTNF''') is a U.S. [[United States National Forest|National Forest]] located in the southern half of [[Missouri]]. MTNF was established on September 11, 1939. It is named for author [[Mark Twain]], a Missouri native. The MTNF covers approximately 1.5 million acres (6,100&nbsp;km<U+00B2>), 78,000 acres (320&nbsp;km<U+00B2>) of which are Wilderness, and National Scenic River area. MTNF spans 29 counties and represents 11% of all forested land in Missouri. MTNF is divided into six distinct ranger districts: Ava-Cassville-Willow Springs, Eleven Point, Houston-Rolla-Cedar Creek, Poplar Bluff, Potosi-Fredericktown, and the Salem. The six ranger districts actually comprise nine overall unique tracts of forests. Its headquarters are in [[Rolla, Missouri]].

Some unique features of the Mark Twain include [[Greer Spring]], which is the largest spring on National Forest land, pumping an average of 214 million gallons of water per day.<ref>http://www.dnr.mo.gov/env/wrc/springsandcaves.htm</ref> The public can also visit the Glade Top Trail National Scenic Byway, which offers views of over {{convert|30|mi|km}} to the [[Boston Mountains]] in [[Arkansas]].

==History==
In the 1870s, citizens of southern Missouri began an era of extensive [[logging]] of the state's native oak, hickory, and pine forests. Lumber mills were commonplace, but by the 1920s they had disappeared, along with much of the state's native forests. Thus, in 1939 President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the MTNF into existence. In March 1933, he also created the Emergency Conservation Work Act, better known as the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] (CCC). In the area that would later become '''Mark Twain National Forest''', hundreds of young men at over fifty CCC sites worked at building roads and planting hundreds of acres of pine to preserve and enhance the natural resources of southern Missouri. Many of their contributions can still be visited and enjoyed today.
