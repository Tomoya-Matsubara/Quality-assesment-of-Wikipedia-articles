[[Image:Lech Walesa Solidarity Time.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[TIME]] magazine cover depicting [[Lech Wa<U+0142><U+0119>sa]] and the [[Solidarity]] movement "shaking up communism."]]
The '''history of Solidarity''', a Polish [[non-governmental]] [[trade union]], began in August 1980 at the [[Gda<U+0144>sk Shipyard]]s where [[Lech Wa<U+0142><U+0119>sa]] and others formed [[Solidarity]] ({{lang-pl|[[Media:Solidarnosc.ogg|Solidarno<U+015B><U+0107>]]}}). In the early 1980s, it became the first independent labor union in a [[Soviet bloc|Soviet-bloc]] country. Solidarity gave rise to a broad [[anti-communist]] [[nonviolent]] [[social movement]] that, at its height, united some 10 million members and vastly contributed to the [[fall of communism]].

[[People's Republic of Poland|Poland's communist government]] attempted to destroy the union by instituting [[Martial law in Poland|martial law]] in 1981, followed by several years of political repression, but in the end was forced to begin negotiating with the union. The [[Roundtable Talks]] between the weakened government and the Solidarity-led opposition resulted in [[Polish legislative elections, 1989|semi-free elections in 1989]]. By the end of August 1989, a Solidarity-led coalition government had been formed, and, in December 1990, Wa<U+0142><U+0119>sa [[Polish presidential election, 1990|was elected]] [[President of Poland|president]]. This was soon followed by the dismantling of the communist governmental system and by Poland's transformation into a modern [[democratic]] state. Solidarity's survival meant a break in the hard-line stance of the [[communist]] [[Polish United Workers' Party]] (''PZPR''), and was an unprecedented event not only for the [[People's Republic of Poland]]<U+2014>a [[satellite state|satellite]] of the [[USSR]] ruled by a [[Single-party state|one-party]] [[communist state|communist regime]]<U+2014>but for the whole of the [[Eastern bloc]]. Solidarity's example  led to the spread of anti-communist ideas and movements throughout the countries of the Eastern Bloc, weakening their communist governments; a process that eventually culminated in the [[Revolutions of 1989]] (the "Autumn of Nations").

<!--[[Image:Astilleros de Gdansk.jpg|thumb|right|500px|[[Gda<U+0144>sk]], 25th anniversary of [[Solidarity]], summer 2005.]]-->
In the 1990s, Solidarity's influence on [[Politics of Poland|Poland's political scene]] waned. A political arm of the "Solidarity" movement, [[Akcja Wyborcza Solidarno<U+015B><U+0107>|Solidarity Electoral Action]] (''AWS''), was founded in 1996 and would win the Polish parliamentary [[Polish parliamentary election, 1997|elections in 1997]], only to lose the subsequent, [[Polish parliamentary election, 2001|2001 elections]]. As of 2006 the Solidarity has little political influence and is more active as a traditional trade union.

==Pre<U+2013>1980 roots==
In the 1970s and 1980s, the initial success of Solidarity in particular, and of [[dissident]] movements in general, was fed by a deepening crisis within Soviet-style societies brought about by declining morale, worsening economic conditions (a [[shortage economy]]), and the growing stresses of the [[Cold War]].<ref name = "Int Soc"> {{cite web

==Early strikes (1980<U+2013>81)==
Strikes did not occur merely due to problems that had emerged shortly before the labor unrest, but due to governmental and economic difficulties spanning more than a decade. In July 1980, [[Edward Gierek]]'s government, facing economic crisis, decided to raise prices while slowing the growth of wages. At once there ensued a wave of strikes and factory occupations.<ref name = "Int Soc"/> Although the strike movement had no coordinating center, the workers had developed an information network to spread news of their struggle. A "dissident" group, the Committee for the Defense of the Workers (''KOR''), which had originally been set up in 1976 to organize aid for victimized workers, attracted small groups of working-class militants in major industrial centers.<ref name = "Int Soc" /> At the [[Lenin Shipyard]] in [[Gda<U+0144>sk]], the firing of [[Anna Walentynowicz]], a popular crane operator and activist, galvanized the outraged workers into action.<ref name = "Int Soc" /><ref name="BBC-80">{{cite web

On August 18, the [[Szczecin Shipyard]] joined the strike, under the leadership of [[Marian Jurczyk]]. A tidal wave of strikes swept the coast, closing ports and bringing the economy to a halt. With ''KOR'' assistance and support from many intellectuals, workers occupying factories, mines and shipyards across Poland joined forces. Within days, over 200 factories and enterprises had joined the strike committee.<ref name = "Int Soc" /><ref name="BBC-80"/> By August 21, most of Poland was affected by the strikes, from coastal shipyards to the mines of the [[Upper Silesian Industrial Area]]. More and more new unions were formed, and joined the federation.

Thanks to popular support within Poland, as well as to international support and media coverage, the Gda<U+0144>sk workers held out until the government gave in to their demands.

The 1991 elections were characterized by a large number of competing parties, many claiming the legacy of anti-communism, and the Solidarity party garnered only 5% of the votes.

On [[January 13]], [[1992]], Solidarity declared its first strike against the democratically elected government: a one-hour strike against a proposal to raise energy prices. Another, two-hour strike took place on December 14. On [[May 19]], [[1993]], Solidarity deputies proposed a [[motion of no confidence|no-confidence motion]]<U+2014>which passed<U+2014>against the government of Prime Minister [[Hanna Suchocka]].<ref name="WIEM"/> President Wa<U+0142><U+0119>sa declined to accept the prime minister's resignation, and dismissed the parliament.

[[Image:Marian Krzaklewski.jpg|thumb|right|100px|[[Marian Krzaklewski]], a late-1990s leader of [[Akcja Wyborcza Solidarno<U+015B><U+0107>|Solidarity Electoral Action]].]]

It was in the ensuing [[Polish parliamentary election, 1993|1993 parliamentary elections]] that it became evident how much Solidarity's support had eroded in the previous three years. Even though some Solidarity deputies sought to assume a more left-wing stance and to distance themselves from the right-wing government, Solidarity remained identified in the public mind with that government. Hence it suffered from the growing disillusionment of the populace, as the transition from a communist to a capitalist system failed to generate instant wealth and raise Poland's [[living standards]] to those in the West, and the government's financial "[[shock therapy]]" (the [[Balcerowicz Plan]]) generated much opposition.<ref name="Kubicek"/><ref name="WIEM"/>

In the elections, Solidarity received only 4.9% of the votes, 0.1% less than the 5% required in order to enter parliament (Solidarity still had 9 senators, 2 fewer then in the previous [[Senate of Poland|Senate]]). The victorious party was the [[Democratic Left Alliance]] (''Sojusz Lewicy Demokratycznej'' or ''SLD''), a [[post-communist]] [[left-wing]] party.<ref name="WIEM"/>

Solidarity now joined forces with its erstwhile enemy, the [[All-Polish Agreement of Trade Unions|All-Polish Conference of Trade Unions]] (''OPZZ''), and some protests were organized by both trade unions.<ref name="Kubicek"/> The following year, Solidarity organized many strikes over the state of the Polish mining industry. In 1995, a demonstration before the Polish parliament was broken up by the police (now again known as ''[[policja]]'') using batons and water guns. Nonetheless, Solidarity decided to support Wa<U+0142><U+0119>sa in the [[Polish presidential election, 1995|1995 presidential elections]].

In a second major defeat for the Polish [[right wing]], the elections were won by an ''SLD'' candidate, [[Aleksander Kwa<U+015B>niewski]], who received 51.72% of votes. A Solidarity call for new elections went unheeded, but the [[Sejm]] still managed to pass a resolution condemning the 1981 martial law (despite the ''SLD'' voting against). Meanwhile the left-wing ''OPZZ'' trade union had acquired 2.5 millions members, twice as many as the contemporary Solidarity (with 1.3 millions).<ref name="Kubicek"/>

[[Image:buzek.jpg|thumb|left|100px|[[Jerzy Buzek]] of [[Akcja Wyborcza Solidarno<U+015B><U+0107>|Solidarity Electoral Action]], late-1990s [[premier of Poland|prime minister]].]]

In June 1996, [[Solidarity Electoral Action]] (''Akcja Wyborcza Solidarno<U+015B><U+0107>'') was founded as a coalition of over 30 [[right-wing]] parties, uniting [[Neoliberalism|liberal]], [[Conservatism|conservative]] and [[Christian democrats|Christian-democratic]] forces. As the public became disillusioned with the ''SLD'' and its allies, ''AWS'' was victorious in the [[Polish parliamentary election, 1997|1997 parliamentary elections]].<ref name="WIEM"/> [[Jerzy Buzek]] became the new prime minister.

However, controversies over domestic reforms, Poland's 1999 entry into [[NATO]], and the accession process to the [[European Union]], combined with ''AWS''' fights with its political allies (the [[Freedom Union (Poland)|Freedom Union]]<U+2014>''Unia Wolno<U+015B>ci'') and infighting within ''AWS'' itself, as well as [[Political corruption|corruption]] (reflected in the infamous "''[[TKM]]''" slogan), eventually resulted in the loss of much public support.<ref name="WIEM"/> ''AWS'' leader [[Marian Krzaklewski]] lost the [[Polish presidential election, 2000|2000 presidential election]], and in the [[Polish parliamentary election, 2001|2001 parliamentary elections]] ''AWS'' failed to elect a single deputy to the parliament.<ref name="WIEM"/> After this debacle, the union decided to distance itself from politics.<ref name="WIEM"/>

As of 2006, Solidarity has some 1.5 million members, but little political clout. Its [[mission statement]] declares that [[Solidarity]], "basing its activities on [[Christian ethics]] and [[Catholic social teachings]], works to protect workers' interests and to fulfill their material, social and cultural aspirations."<ref>{{cite web
