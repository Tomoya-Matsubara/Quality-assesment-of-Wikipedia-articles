'''''Ericiolacerta''''' was a small (8 inches/20 centimeters) [[therocephalia]]n  [[therapsid]] from the early [[Triassic]] of South Africa. The fossils suggest that it was a small, arboreal/terrestrial carnivore, possibly hunting in packs.
==Popular Culture==
''Ericiolacerta'' was seen in the 3rd episode  of [[Walking With Monsters]].
It was shown having venom, but there is no fossil evidence to prove that..
The CGI model of this animals is actually very similar to that of the [[Thrinaxodon|cynodonts of the documentary Walking With Dinosaurs]].
