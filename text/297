==Demographics==
{{main|Demographics of Pakistan|Demographics of Afghanistan}}

[[Image:Pashtunarea.svg|right|thumb|250px|Distribution of Pashtuns in southern and eastern Afghanistan and western Pakistan ''(in red)'']]
The vast majority of Pashtuns can be found in an area stretching from western Pakistan to southwestern Afghanistan. Additional Pashtun communities live in the [[Northern Areas, Pakistan|Northern Areas]], [[Azad Kashmir]] and [[Karachi]] in Pakistan as well as throughout Afghanistan. There are smaller communities in [[Iran]] and [[India]], and a large migrant worker community in the countries of the [[Arabian Peninsula]]. Important metropolitan centers of Pashtun culture include [[Peshawar]] and [[Kandahar]]. In addition, [[Quetta]] and [[Kabul]] are ethnically mixed cities with large Pashtun populations.

Pashtuns comprise over 15.42% of [[Demographics of Pakistan|Pakistan's population]] or 25.6 million<ref name="Pakistan census"/> and in [[Demographics of Afghanistan|Afghanistan]] are 42% of the population or 12.5 million. Though no official census has been conduted in Afghanistan for decades, some higher estimates place speakers of [[Pashto language|Pashto]] at 60% to 65% of the population.<ref name="hewad">[http://www.hewad.com/ethnic.htm The ethnic composition of Afghanistan] ''WAK Foundation 1999 Norway'' (retrieved 10 January 2007)</ref> The exact measure of all of these figures remains uncertain, particularly those for Afghanistan, and are affected by approximately three million Afghan refugees (of which 81.5% or 2.49 million are ethnic Pashtuns) that remain in Pakistan.<ref name="UNHCR"/> An unknown number of refugees continue to reside in Iran.<ref name="irin">[http://www.irinnews.org/report.asp?ReportID=50927&SelectRegion=Asia Iran-Pakistan: Refugees], ''IRIN Asia, UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs'' (retrieved 7 June 2006)</ref> A cumulative population assessment suggests a total of over 40 million.<ref name="Pakistan census"/><ref name=ref name="CIA Afghanistan"/><ref name="UNHCR"/>

==History and origins==
{{seealso|History of Afghanistan|History of Pakistan}}
[[Image:AbdurRahmanKhan-A.JPG|thumb|left|150px|[[Abdur Rahman Khan|Amir Abdur Rahman Khan]], former ruler of Afghanistan (1844-1901) who agreed to the [[Durand Line]] which divided traditionally Pashtun territories.]]
The history of the Pashtuns is ancient and much of it has yet to be fully researched. From the second millennium BCE to the present, Pashtun regions have seen invasions and migrations including [[Indo-Iranians|Aryan tribes]] ([[Iranian peoples]], [[Indo-Aryans]], [[Medes]], and [[Persian people|Persians]]), [[Scythians]], [[Kushan]]s, [[Hephthalites]], Greeks, [[Arab]]s, [[Turkic peoples|Turks]], and [[Mongols]]. There are many conflicting theories about the origins of the Pashtun people, some modern and others archaic, both among historians and the Pashtuns themselves.

===Ancient references===

The Greek historian [[Herodotus]] first mentioned a people called ''Pactyan'' living on the eastern frontier of the Persian [[Satrapy]] [[Arachosia]] as early as the [[1st millennium BCE]].<ref name="Heredotus">[http://www.piney.com/Heredotus7.html Chapter 7] of ''The History of Herodotus'' (trans. George Rawlinson; originally written 440&nbsp;BCE)(retrieved 10 January 2007)</ref> In addition, the [[Rig-Veda]] mentions a tribe called the ''[[Pakthas]]'' (in the region of ''Pakhat'') as inhabiting eastern Afghanistan and some have speculated that they may have been early ancestors of the Pashtuns.<ref name="Rig Veda">[http://www.politicalgateway.com/documents/religions/rigveda7.html Rig Veda Book Seven], ''Political Gateway'' (retrieved 7 June 2006)</ref> Other ancient peoples linked to the Pashtuns includes the [[Bactrians]] who spoke a related [[Middle Iranian]] language.

Pashtuns are also historically referred to as ethnic [[Afghans]] as the terms Pashtun and Afghan were synonymous until the advent of modern Afghanistan and the division of the Pashtuns by the [[Durand Line]], a border drawn by the British in the late 19th century. According to V. Minorsky, W.K. Frazier Tyler, M.C. Gillet and several other scholars, "The word Afghan first appears in history in the Hudud-al-Alam in 982&nbsp;CE."<ref name="Khalaj">[http://www.khyber.org/articles/2005/TheKhalajWestoftheOxus.shtml The Khalaj West of the Oxus]; excerpts from "The Turkish Dialect of the Khalaj", ''Bulletin of the School of Oriental Studies'', University of London, Vol 10, No 2, pp 417-437 (retrieved 10 January 2007)</ref> It was used by the Pashtuns and refers to a common legendary ancestor known as ''Afghana''. 

It is believed that the Pashtuns emerged from the area around [[Kandahar]] and the [[Suleiman Mountains]] and began expanding millennia ago.<ref name="ISBN Social Politics"/> In this geographic location they would have often been in close contact with the Persians, while according to archaeological, morphological and hermeneutic evidence many Pashtuns were most likely [[Paganism|Pagan]], with sizable minorities of [[Buddhists]], [[Hindus]], [[Zoroastrians]] and [[Jews]] prior to the arrival of [[Muslim]] [[Arab]]s in the [[8th century|eighth century]]&nbsp;CE.<ref name="lonely planet">[http://www.lonelyplanet.com/worldguide/destinations/asia/afghanistan/essential?a=culture Background Information on Afghanistan-Pre 20th Century History], ''Lonely Planet'' (retrieved 10 January 2007)</ref>

===Anthropology and linguistics===

The origins of the Pashtuns are mixed, but their language is classified as an [[Eastern Iranian]] tongue, itself a sub-branch of the [[Indo-Iranian languages|Indo-Iranian]] branch of the greater [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] family of languages, and thus the Pashtuns are classified as an [[Iranian peoples|Iranian people]],<ref name="Britannica Pashtun">[http://www.britannica.com/ebc/article-9374656?query=Herder&ct= Pashtun], ''[[Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica]]''(retrieved 10 January 2007)</ref><ref name="CAIS">[http://www.cais-soas.com/articles/iranian-peoples_articles.htm#3.%20Iranian%20Peoples Circle of Ancient Iranian Studies] ''cais-soas.com'' (retrieved 10 January 2007)</ref><ref name="Pashto">Awde, Nicholas and Sarwan, Asmatullah: ''Pashto Dictionary & Phrasebook: Pashto-English, English-Pashto''.

V. Gankovsky, the Pashtuns began as a "union of largely East-Iranian tribes which became the initial ethnic stratum of the Pashtun ethnogenesis dates from the middle of the first millennium CE and is connected with the dissolution of the [[Hephthalites|Epthalite (White Huns)]] confederacy."<ref name="Gankovsky">Gankovsky, Yu. V., et al. ''A History of Afghanistan'', Moscow: Progress Publishers, 1982, p. 382 (retrieved 10 January 2007)</ref> Early precursors to the Pashtuns were Old Iranian tribes that spread throughout the eastern [[Iranian plateau]].<ref name="Iranian plateau">[http://www.britannica.com/eb/topic-293592/Iranian-plateau Iranian plateau], ''Encyclopaedia Britannica'' (retrieved 10 February 2007)</ref><ref name="U of T">[http://www.utexas.edu/cola/centers/lrc/eieol/aveol-0-X.html Old Iranian Online], ''University of Texas College of Liberal Arts'' (retrieved 10 February 2007)</ref>
The Pashto-speaking Pashtuns refer to themselves as Pashtuns or Pukhtuns depending upon whether they are speakers of the southern dialect or northern dialect respectively. These Pashtuns compose the core of ethnic Pashtuns who are found in western Pakistan and southern-eastern Afghanistan. Many Pashtuns have intermingled with various invaders, neighboring groups, and migrants (as have the other Iranian peoples). In terms of phenotype, the Pashtuns overall are predominantly a [[Mediterranean]] [[Caucasoid]] people,<ref name="Library of Congress: Afghanistan">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+af0037) Afghanistan Ethnic Groups: Pashtun], ''US Library of Congress'' (retrieved 10 January 2007)</ref> although light hair and eye colors are not uncommon, especially among remote mountain tribes.

===Oral traditions===
[[Image:Shabkadr_Fort_outside_Peshawar_attacked_by_tribesmen.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Pashtun tribesmen attacking the British-held Shabkadr Fort outside Peshawar in 1897]]
Some [[anthropologist]]s lend credence to the mythical oral traditions of the [[Pashtun tribes]] themselves. For example, according to the ''[[Encyclopaedia of Islam]]'', the [[Theory of Pashtun descent from Israelites]] is traced to ''Maghzan-e-Afghani'' who compiled a history for ''Khan-e-Jehan Lodhi'' in the reign of [[Mughal]] Emperor [[Jehangir]] in the [[17th century|seventeenth century]]&nbsp;CE. Another book, that corresponds with Pashtun historical records, ''Taaqati-Nasiri'', states that in the seventh century a people called the [[Children of Israel|Bani Israel]] settled in [[Ghor]], southeast of [[Herat]], Afghanistan and then migrated south and east. These Bani Israel references are in line with the commonly held view by Pashtuns that when the twelve tribes of [[Israelite|Israel]] were dispersed (see [[Israel and Judah]] and [[Lost Ten Tribes]]), the tribe of [[Tribe of Joseph|Joseph]], among other Hebrew tribes, settled in the region.<ref name="Virtual Jewish History">[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Afghanistan.html Afghanistan], ''The Virtual Jewish History Tour'' (retrieved 10 January 2007)</ref> Hence the tribal name '[[Yousafzai|Yusef Zai]]' in Pashto translates to the 'sons of Joseph'. A similar story is told by Iranian historian [[Ferishta]].<ref name="Ferishta">[http://persian.packhum.org/persian/pf?file=06901021&ct=10 Introduction]: [[Ferishta|Muhammad Q<U+0101>sim Hind<U+016B> <U+0160><U+0101>h Astar<U+0101>b<U+0101>d<U+012B> Firi<U+0161>tah]], ''History Of The Mohamedan Power In India'', The Packard Humanities Institute Persian Texts in Translation (retrieved 10 January 2007)</ref> 

Maghzan-e-Afghani's Bani-Israel theory has largely been debunked due to historical and linguistic inconsistencies. The oral tradition is believed to be a myth that grew out of a political and cultural struggle between Pashtuns and the [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]], which explains the historical backdrop for the creation of the myth, the inconsistencies of the mythology, and the linguistic research that refutes any [[Semitic]] origins.<ref name="Afghanology">[http://www.afghanology.com/BaniIsraeli.html Bani-Israelite Theory of Paktoons Ethnic Origin] ''Afghanology.com'' (retrieved 10 January 2007)</ref>

Other Pashtun tribes claim descent from [[Arabs]] including some even claiming to be descendants of the Muslim Prophet [[Muhammad]] (popularly referred to as [[sayyid]]s).<ref name="ISBN Olaf Caroe"/> Some groups from [[Peshawar]] and [[Kandahar]] (such as the [[Afridis]], [[Khattak]]s and [[Sadozai]]s) also claim to be descended from [[Alexander the Great]]'s Greeks.<ref name="Greek ancestry">[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=14986106&dopt=Abstract Investigation of the Greek ancestry of populations from northern Pakistan], ''Human Genetics'', 2004 Apr;114(5):484-90. Epub 2004 Feb 25 (retrieved 10 January 2007)</ref>

===Genetics===

Research into human [[DNA]] has emerged as a new and innovative tool being used to explore the genetic make-up of various populations in order to ascertain historical population movements. According to some [[Genetic testing|genetic research]] the Pashto-speaking Pashtuns are mainly related to other Iranian peoples as well as the [[Burusho]] of the [[Northern Areas]] of Pakistan, who speak a [[language isolate]].<ref name="Greek ancestry"/>

===Modern era===
[[Image:Hamid Karzai.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Hamid Karzai]], the [[President of Afghanistan]], is an ethnic Pashtun from [[Kandahar]].]]
The Pashtuns are intimately tied to the history of modern Afghanistan and western Pakistan stretching back to the [[Hotaki]] dynasty and later the [[Durrani Empire]].<ref name="US State Dept">[http://dosfan.lib.uic.edu/ERC/bgnotes/sa/afghanistan9407.html Afghanistan: History], ''U.S. Department of State'' (retrieved 10 October 2006)</ref> The Hotakis were [[Ghilzai]] tribesmen, who defeated the Persian [[Safavid dynasty|Safavids]] and seized control over much of [[Persian Empire|Persia]] from 1722 to 1736. This was followed by the conquests of [[Ahmad Shah Durrani]] who was a former high-ranking military commander under the ruler [[Nadir Shah]] of Persia. He founded the Durrani Empire that covered most of what is today Afghanistan, Pakistan, [[Kashmir]], [[Punjab (India)|Indian Punjab]], and [[Khorasan]] province of Iran.<ref name="PBS Map">[http://www.pbs.org/wnet/wideangle/shows/afghanistan/images/info_g2.gif Map of Durrani Empire], ''pbs.org'' (retrieved 10 October 2006)</ref><ref name="Durrani Map">[http://www.afghanland.com/history/ahmadshah.html Map of the Durrani Empire], ''Afghanland'' (retrieved 10 October 2006)</ref> After the fall of the Durrani Empire in 1818, it was the [[Barakzai]] clan that took control of Afghanistan. Specifically, the subclan known as the [[Mohamedzai]], ruled Afghanistan between 1826 to the end of [[Mohammad Zahir Shah]] reign in 1973. This legacy continues into modern times as Afghanistan is run by President [[Hamid Karzai]]. 

The Pashtuns in Afghanistan fought the British to a standstill and kept the [[Russians]] at bay during the so-called [[Great Game]], during which Afghanistan remained an independent state that played the two large imperialist empires against each other to maintain some semblance of autonomy. Despite this, during the reign of [[Abdur Rahman Khan]] (1880-1901), Pashtun regions were divided by the [[Durand Line]] and control of what is today western Pakistan was ceded to [[British India]] in 1893.<ref name="Britannica Durand">[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9031550/Durand-Line Durand Line], [[Encyclopaedia Britannica]] (retrieved 10 October 2006)</ref> In the twentieth century, various Pashtuns living under [[British India]]n rule in the [[North-West Frontier Province]] agitated for Indian independence, including [[Khan Wali Khan]] and [[Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan]] (both members of the [[Khudai Khidmatgar]], popularly referred to as the ''Surkh posh'' or "the Red shirts"), and were inspired by [[Mahatma Gandhi]]'s non-violent method of resistance.<ref name="Red Shirts">[http://www.bachakhan.com/ Khan Abdul-Ghaffar Khan], ''Bachakhan.com'' (retrieved 10 October 2006)</ref> Later, in the 1970s, Khan Wali Khan pressed for more autonomy for Pashtuns.

Pashtuns in Afghanistan attained complete independence from British intervention during the reign of King [[Amanullah Khan]], following the [[Third Anglo-Afghan War]].<ref name="iranica anglo-afghan"/> The monarchy ended with [[Mohammed Daoud Khan|Sardar Daoud Khan]] seizing control of Afghanistan in 1973, which opened the door to Soviet intervention and eventually culminated in the [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan|Saur Revolution]] or Communist take-over of Afghanistan in 1978. Starting in the late 1970s, many Pashtuns joined the Mujahideen opposition against the [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]]. These Mujahideen fought for control of Afghanistan against the Communist [[Khalq]] and the [[Parcham]] factions. More recently, the Pashtuns became known for being the primary ethnic group that comprised the [[Taliban]], which was a religious movement that emerged from [[Kandahar]], Afghanistan.<ref name="BBC Taliban">[http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/recent/sept_11/afghan_culture_03.shtml Afghanistan: At the Crossroads of Ancient Civilisations], [[BBC]] (retrieved 10 October 2006)</ref> As of late 2001, the Taliban government had been removed from power as a result of the [[US-led invasion of Afghanistan]]. 

Pashtuns have played an important role in the region of [[South Asia|South]] and [[Central Asia]]. The current President of Afghanistan, [[Hamid Karzai]] from [[Qandahar]]. In neighboring Pakistan ethnic Pashtun politicians, notably [[Ayub Khan]] and [[Ghulam Ishaq Khan]], have also attained the Presidency in the past. The Afghan royal family now represented by [[Muhammad Zahir Shah]] is also of ethnic Pashtun origin. Other prominent Pashtuns include the seventeenth century warrior poet [[Khushal Khan Khattak]], Afghan "Iron" Emir [[Abdur Rahman Khan]] and in modern times [[Ambassadors from the United States|U.S. Ambassador]] to [[Iraq]] [[Zalmay Khalilzad]] and former [[Cosmonaut]] [[Abdul Ahad Mohmand]] among many others.

==Pashtuns defined==
[[Image:Afghan girl Pashtun.JPEG|thumb|150px|A close up of a Pashtun girl from Kabul, Afghanistan.]]
Among historians, anthropologists, and the Pashtuns themselves, there is some debate as to who exactly is a Pashtun. The most prominent views are:
* Pashtuns are predominantly an [[Iranian people|Eastern Iranian people]] who are speakers of the [[Pashto]] language and live in a contiguous geographic location across Pakistan and Afghanistan. This is the generally accepted academic view.<ref name="Britannica: Pashtuns">[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9058636/Pashtun Pashtun] ''Britannica On-Line'' (retrieved 18 January 2007).</ref>
* Pashtuns are [[Muslim]], following [[Pashtunwali]], as well as being Pashto-speakers and meeting other criteria.<ref name="UPenn Gazette">[http://www.upenn.edu/gazette/0506/feature2_4.html Understanding Pashto] ''University of Pennsylvania Gazette'' (retrieved 18 January 2007)</ref> 
* In accordance with the legend of [[Qais Abdur Rashid]], the figure traditionally regarded as progenitor of the Pashtun people, Pashtuns are those whose related patrilineal descent may be traced back to legendary times.
These three definitions may be described as the ethno-linguistic definition, the religious-cultural definition, and the patrilineal definition, respectively.

===Ethnic definition===
The ethno-linguistic definition is the most prominent and accepted view as to who is and is not a Pashtun.<ref name="Library of Congress Pakhtuns">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+pk0053) Pakistan: Pakhtuns] ''US Library of Congress'' (retrieved 18 January 2007)</ref> Generally, this most common view holds that Pashtuns are defined within the parameters of having mainly eastern Iranian ethnic origins, sharing a common language, culture and history, living in relatively close geographic proximity to each other, and acknowledging each other as kinsmen. Thus, tribes that speak disparate yet mutually intelligible dialects of Pashto will acknowledge each other as ethnic Pashtuns and even subscribe to certain dialects as "proper", such as the Pukhtu spoken by the [[Yousafzai]] and the Pashto spoken by the [[Durrani]] in Kandahar.<ref name="Translation Center: Pashto">[http://www.nvtc.gov/lotw/months/february/pashto.html#dial Pashto] ''National Virtual Translation Center'' (retrieved 18 January 2007)</ref> These criteria tend to be used by most Pashtuns in Pakistan and Afghanistan as the basis for who can be counted as a Pashtun.

===Cultural definition===
The religious and cultural definition is more stringent and requires Pashtuns to be Muslim and adherents of the Pashtunwali code.<ref name="New Yorker Pashtun">[http://www.newyorker.com/fact/content/articles/011203fa_FACT1 The Pashtun Code], ''The New Yorker'' (retrieved 18 January 2007)</ref> This is the most prevalent view among the more orthodox and conservative tribesmen who do not view Pashtuns of the Jewish faith as actual Pashtuns even if they themselves might claim to be of Hebrew ancestry depending upon which tribe is in question. The religious definition for Pashtuns is partially based upon the laws of Pashtunwali, and that those who are Pashtun must follow and honor Pashtunwali. However, Pashtun society is not entirely homogenous in the religious sense, as Pashtuns, who are predominantly [[Sunni]] Muslims, can also be followers of the [[Shia]] sect among others. In addition, the [[Jews and Judaism in Pakistan|Pakistani Jews]] and the [[Jews of Afghanistan|Afghan Jewish]] population, once numbering in the thousands, have largely relocated to [[Israel]]. Overall, more flexibility can be found among Pashtun intellectuals and academics who sometimes simply define who is and is not a Pashtun based upon other criteria that often excludes religion.

===Ancestral definition===
The patrilineal definition is based on an important orthodox law of Pashtunwali. Its main requirement is that anyone claiming to be a Pashtun must have a Pashtun father. This law has maintained the tradition of exclusively patriarchal tribal lineage intact. Under this definition,  in order to be an ethnic Pashtun, there is less regard as to what language one speaks (Pashto, Persian, Urdu, English, etc.), while more emphasis is placed upon one's father. Thus, the Pathans in [[India]], for example, who have lost both the language and presumably many of the ways of their putative ancestors, can, by being able to trace their fathers' ethnic heritage back to the Pashtun tribes (who some believe are descendants of the four grandsons of [[Qais Abdur Rashid]], a possible legendary progenitor of the Pashtuns), remain "Pashtun".<ref name="Pathans in Retrospect">[http://www.afghanan.net/pashto/pashtunwali/retrospect.htm Pathans in retrospect], ''Afghanan dot Net'' (retrieved 18 January 2007)</ref> The legend states that Qais, after having heard of the new religion of Islam, traveled to meet the Muslim Prophet [[Muhammad]] in [[Medina]] and returned to Afghanistan-Pakistan area a Muslim. Qais, in turn, purportedly had many children and one son, Afghana, produced up to four sons who set out towards the east including one son who went towards [[Swat (Pakistan)|Swat]], another towards [[Lahore]], another to [[Multan]], and finally one to [[Quetta]]. This legend is one of many traditional tales among the Pashtuns regarding their disparate origins that remain largely unverifiable.

==Putative ancestry==
There are various communities which claim Pashtun descent and are largely found amongst other groups in [[South Asia|South]] and [[Central Asia]] who generally do not speak Pashto and are often considered either overlapping groups or are simply assigned to the ethno-linguistic group that corresponds to their geographic location and their mother tongue. Some groups who claim Pashtun descent include various non-Pashtun Afghans who are often conversant in [[Persian language|Persian]] rather than Pashto.<ref name="CIA Afghanistan"/> 

Many claimants of Pashtun heritage in [[South Asia]] have mixed with local Muslim populations and refer to themselves (and Pashto-speaking Pashtuns and often Afghans in general) in the [[Hindi-Urdu]] variant '''Pathan''' rather than Pashtun or Pukhtun.<ref name="Islamic Voice">[http://www.islamicvoice.com/may.2003/cseries.htm Memons, Khojas, Cheliyas, Moplahs.... How Well Do You Know Them?] ''Islamic Voice'' (retrieved 18 January 2007)</ref> These populations are usually only part-Pashtun, to varying degrees, and often trace their Pashtun ancestry putatively through a paternal lineage, and are not universally viewed as ethnic Pashtuns (see section on ''Pashtuns Defined'' for further analysis).

Some groups claiming Pashtun descent live in close proximity to Pashtuns such as the [[Hindkowan people|Hindkowans]] who are sometimes referred to as ''Punjabi Pathans'' (in publications such as [[Encyclopedia Britannica|Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica]]). The Hindkowans speak the [[Hindko language]] and are regarded as a group of mixed Pashtun and [[Punjabi people|Punjabi]] origin.<ref name="JSTOR Hindko">[http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0041-977X(1980)43%3A3%3C482%3AHIKAP%3E2.0.CO%3B2-M Hindko in Kohat and Peshawar] ''Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies'', University of London, Vol. 43, No. 3 (1980), pp. 482-510 (retrieved 18 January 2007)</ref> Culturally similar to Pashtuns, the Hinkowans often practice Pashtunwali in Pashtun-majority areas. The Hindkowans are a large minority in major cities such as [[Peshawar]], [[Kohat]], [[Mardan]], and [[Dera Ismail Khan]] and in mixed districts including [[Haripur]] and [[Abbottabad]] where they are often bilingual in [[Hindko]] and [[Pashto]].

Additionally, upwards of 20% of [[Urdu language|Urdu]]-speakers claim partial Pashtun ancestry.<ref name="Pathan Communities in India">[http://www.dawatnet.com/full2.php?id=334 Study of the Pathan Communities in four States of India], ''Dawat Magazine'' (retrieved 18 January 2007)</ref><ref name="Joshua Project">[http://www.joshuaproject.net/peoples.php Urdu speaking Pathans in India], ''Joshua Project'' (retrieved 18 January 2007)</ref> Indian Pathans claim descent from Pashtun soldiers that settled in northern India and intermarried with local Muslims during the era of the [[Delhi Sultanate]] and [[Mughal Empire]]. The [[Rohilla]] Pashtuns, after their defeat by the British, are notable for having intermarried with local Muslims. They are believed to have been bilingual in Pashto and Urdu until the mid-nineteenth century. The repression of Rohilla Pashtuns by the British in the late eighteenth century caused thousands to flee to the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] colony of [[Guyana]] in [[South America]].<ref name="Rohillas''>[http://afghanland.com/culture/guyana.html Afghans of Guyana], ''Afghanland.com'' (retrieved 18 January 2007)</ref> 

Lastly, small minorities of [[Sikhs]] and [[Hindus]], who are often bilingual in [[Pashto]] and [[Punjabi]], are estimated to be in the thousands and can be found in parts of Afghanistan.<ref name="Afghan Sikhs">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/3138282.stm Sikhs struggle in Afghanistan], ''[[BBC News]]'' (retrieved 18 January 2007)</ref>

==Culture==
{{main|Pashtun culture}}
[[Image:Pasht rug.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Pashtun vendor displaying a silk rug from Afghanistan]]
Pashtun culture was formed over the course of many centuries. Pagan traditions survived in the form of traditional dances, while literary styles and music largely reflect strong influence from the [[Culture of Iran|Persian tradition]] and regional musical instruments fused with localized variants and interpretation. Pashtun culture is a unique blend of native customs and strong influences from [[Central Asian|Central]], [[South Asia|South]] and [[Middle East|West Asia]]. 

===Language ===
{{main|Pashto language}}
The Pashtuns speak [[Pashto language|Pashto]], an [[Indo-European language]]. It belongs to the [[Iranian languages|Iranian sub-group]] of the [[Indo-Iranian languages|Indo-Iranian]] branch.<ref name="Omniglot">[http://www.omniglot.com/writing/pashto.htm Pashto language, alphabet and pronounciation], ''Omniglot'' (retrieved 18 January 2007)</ref> It can be further delineated within [[Eastern Iranian]] and Southeastern Iranian. Pashto is written in the [[Perso-Arabic script]] and is divided into two main dialects, the northern "Pukhtu" and the southern "Pashto". 

Pashto has ancient origins and bears similarities to extinct languages such as [[Avestan language|Avestan]] and [[Bactrian language|Bactrian]].<ref name="Britannica Avestan">[http://www.britannica.com/ebc/article-9356220 Avestan language], ''Encyclopaedia Britannica'' (retrieved 18 February 2007)</ref> Its closest modern relatives include [[Pamir languages]], such as [[Shughni language|Shughni]] and [[Wakhi language|Wakhi]], and more distantly [[Ossetic]] and has an ancient legacy of borrowing vocabulary from neighboring languages including [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Vedic Sanskrit|archaic Sanskrit]]. Invaders have left vestiges as well as Pashto has borrowed words from [[ancient Greek]], [[Arabic]] and [[Turkic languages|Turkic]], while modern borrowings come primarily from [[English language|English]].<ref name="ISBN Pashto Dictionary">Awde, Nicholas and Asmatullah Sarwan. 2002. ''Pashto: Dictionary & Phrasebook'', New York: Hippocrene Books Inc. ISBN 0-7818-0972-X (retrieved 18 February 2007).</ref> 

Fluency in Pashto is often the main determinant as to whether there is group acceptance as to who is and is not considered a Pashtun. Pashtun nationalism emerged following the rise of Pashto poetry that linked language and ethnic identity starting with the work of [[Khushal Khan Khattak]] and continued with his grandson [[Afzal Khan Khattak|Afzal Khan]] (author of ''Tarikh-e Morassa'', a history of the Pashtun people).<ref name="ISBN Pashto Dictionary"/> 

Pashto has national status in Afghanistan and regional status in Pakistan. In addition to their mother-tongue, many Pashtuns are fluent in [[Dari (Afghanistan)|Dari]] (Afghan Persian) and/or [[Urdu]] as well as English.

===Religion===
{{main|Islam in Pakistan|Islam in Afghanistan|Jews and Judaism in Pakistan|Jews of Afghanistan}}
Pashtuns are predominantly [[Sunni]] [[Muslims]], most of them followers of the [[Hanafite]] branch of Sunni [[Islam]]. There is a small minority of [[Twelvers|Ithna Asharia Shia]] Pashtuns largely concentrated in Afghanistan.<ref name="US Library of Congress: Afghanistan Ethnic Groups">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+af0037) Pashtun] ''US Library of Congress'' (retrieved 18 January 2007).</ref>

Studies conducted amongst the [[Ghilzai]] reveal strong linkages between tribal affiliation and membership in the larger [[ummah]] (Islamic community), as most Pashtuns believe that they are descendents of the aforementioned [[Qais Abdur Rashid]] who is purported to have been an early convert to Islam and thus bequeathed the faith to the entire Pashtun population.<ref name="Afghanistan religion">[http://www.gl.iit.edu/govdocs/afghanistan/Religion.html Meaning and Practice], ''Afghanistan Country Study: Religion'', Illinois Institute of Technology (retrieved 18 January 2007)</ref> A legacy of [[sufi]] activity remains common in Pashtun regions as evident in song and dance. Many Pashtuns are prominent [[Ulema]], or Islamic scholars, such as [[Muhammad Muhsin Khan|Dr. Muhammad Muhsin Khan]] who translated the [[Noble Qur'an (Hilali-Khan)|Noble Quran]] and [[Sahih Al-Bukhari]] and many other books into [[English language|English]].<ref name="Noble Quran">[http://firstedition.com.my/the%20noble%20quran.htm ''The Noble Quran'' (in 9 VOLUMES), Arabic-English], (ed. Dr. Muhammad Muhsin Khan) (retrieved 18 January 2007)</ref> 

Non-Muslim Pashtuns are virtually non-existent as there is limited data regarding [[Irreligion|irreligious]] groups and minorities. Following the founding of the state of [[Israel]] after [[World War II]] and ensuing decades, a tiny Pashtun [[Jewish]] population (numbering in the hundreds) left Kandahar and Peshawar.<ref name="Tufts Peshawar Jews">[http://fletcher.tufts.edu/news/2005/09/najam091605.shtml Where have Pakistan<U+2019>s Jews gone?] ''Tufts University: Fletcher School'' (retrieved 19 February 2007).</ref><ref name="Kandahar Jews">[http://bh.org.il/Communities/Archive/Afghanistan.asp The Jews of Afghanistan] ''Museum of the Jewish People'' (retrieved 19 February 2007).</ref>

===Pashto literature===
<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Khattak.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Khushal Khan Khattak]], the 17th century warrior poet of the Pashtuns.]] -->
Throughout Pashtun history, poets, prophets, kings and warriors have been amongst the most revered members of society. For much of Pashtun history, literature has not played a major role as [[Persian literature|Persian]] was the literary ''[[lingua franca]]'' used for communication purposes by neighboring peoples and generally relied upon for writing purposes. However, by the sixteenth century early written records of Pashto began to appear, the earliest of which describes Sheikh Mali's conquest of [[State of Swat|Swat]].<ref name="UCLA">[http://www.afghan-network.net/Ethnic-Groups/pashtu-history.html History of Pushto language], ''UCLA Language Materials Project'' (retrieved 18 January 2007)</ref> The advent of Pashto poetry and the revered works of [[Khushal Khan Khattak]] and [[Rahman Baba]] in the seventeenth century helped transition Pashto towards the modern period.<ref name="Rahman Baba">[http://www.pashto.org/content/view/12/26/ Rahman Baba: Poet of the Pashtuns] ''Pashto.org'' (retrieved 18 January 2007)</ref> In the twentieth century, Pashto literature gained significant prominence with the poetic works of [[Ameer Hamza Shinwari]] who was noted for his development of ''Pashto Ghazals''.<ref name="Shinwari Baba">[http://www.khyber.org/people/literary/AmirHamzaShinwariBaba.shtml Amir Hamza Shinwari Baba], ''Khyber.org'' (retrieved 18 January 2007)</ref> In recent times, Pashto literature has received increased patronage, but due to relatively high illiteracy rates, many Pashtuns continue to rely upon the oral tradition. Pashtun males continue to meet at ''chai khaana''s or tea cafes to listen and relate various oral tales of valor and history. 

Despite the general male dominance of Pashto oral story-telling, Pashtun society is also marked by some [[matriarchal]] tendencies.<ref name="Pashtun poetess">[http://www.boston.com/news/globe/ideas/articles/2005/05/22/the_tale_of_the_pashtun_poetess/?rss_id=Boston+Globe+--+Ideas+Section The tale of the Pashtun poetess], Leela Jacinto, ''The Boston Globe'', May 22, 2005 (retrieved 18 January 2007)</ref> Folktales involving reverence for Pashtun mothers and matriarchs are common and are passed down from parent to child, as is most Pashtun heritage, through a rich [[oral tradition]] that has survived the ravages of time.

===Pashtunwali===
{{main|Pashtunwali}}
The term "Pakhto" or "Pashto" from which the Pashtuns derive their name is not merely the name of their language, but is synonymous with a pre-Islamic honor code/religion formally known as [[Pashtunwali]] (or ''Pakhtunwali'').<ref name="Pakhtunwali">[http://www.afghanan.net/pashto/pashtunwali/pashtunwali.htm Pakhtunwali], Afghanan dot net (retrieved 18 January 2007)</ref> Pashtunwali is believed to have originated millennia ago during pagan times and has, in many ways, fused with Islamic tradition.<ref name="Pashtunwali">[http://afghanland.com/culture/pashtunwali.html Pashtunwali: The Way of the Pashtuns], ''Afghanland.com'' (retrieved 18 January 2007)</ref> Pashtunwali governs and regulates nearly all aspects of Pashtun life ranging from tribal affairs to individual "honor" (''nang'') and behavior. 

There are numerous intricate tenets of Pashtunwali that influence Pashtun social behavior. One of the better known tenets is ''Melmastia'' or the notion of hospitality and asylum to all guests seeking help. Perceived wrongs or injustice call for ''Badal'' or swift revenge. A popular Pashtun saying, "Revenge is dish best served cold", was borrowed by the British and popularized in the [[Western world|West]].<ref name="ISBN Insight Guide Pakistan">Halliday, Tony (ed.). 1998. ''Insight Guide Pakistan'', Duncan, South Carolina: Langenscheidt Publishing Group. ISBN 0887297366 (retrieved 19 February 2007).</ref> Men are expected to protect ''Zan, Zar, Zameen'' which translates to women, treasure, and land. Some aspects promote peaceful co-existence such as ''Nanawati'' or the humble admission of guilt for a wrong committed, which should result in automatic forgiveness from the wronged party. These and other basic precepts of Pashtunwali continue to be followed by many Pashtuns, especially in rural areas.

===Sports===

Native traditional sports include ''[[buzkashi]]'', a contest between horsemen (believed to have been brought to the region by the [[Mongols]]) that entails dragging a goat carcass and keeping it away from other players. Another Pashtun past-time is ''naiza bazi'', which also involves horsemen who compete in spear throwing.<ref>[http://www.everyculture.com/wc/Afghanistan-to-Bosnia-Herzegovina/Pashtun.html Pashtun Sports], ''World Cultures'' (retrieved 18 January 2007)</ref>

[[Polo]] is also an ancient traditional sport in the region and is a popular amongst many tribesmen such as the [[Yousafzai]]. Like other Afghans, many Pashtuns engage in wrestling (''[[Pehlwani]]''), which is often part of larger sporting events.<ref>[http://www.cp-pc.ca/english/afghanistan/sports.html Afghanistan: Sports and Recreation], ''Afghanistan'' (retrieved 18 January 2007)</ref> Another Pashtun past-time is ''naiza bazi'', which also involves horsemen who compete in spear throwing.<ref>[http://www.everyculture.com/wc/Afghanistan-to-Bosnia-Herzegovina/Pashtun.html Pashtun Sports], ''World Cultures'' (retrieved 18 January 2007)</ref> Cricket is largely a legacy of British rule in the North-West Frontier Province and many Pashtuns have become prominent participants (such as [[Shahid Afridi]] and [[Imran Khan]]).

[[Football (soccer)]] is a more recent sport that increasing numbers of Pashtuns have started to play. Children engage in various games including a form of [[marbles]] called ''buzul-bazi'' which is played with the knuckle bones of sheep. Although traditionally less involved in sports than boys, young Pashtun girls often play [[volleyball]] and [[basketball]], especially in urban areas.

===Performing arts===
Pashtun performers remain avid participants in various physical forms of expression including dance, sword fighting, and other physical feats. Perhaps the most common form of artistic expression can be seen in the various forms of Pashtun dances.

One of the most prominent dances is the ''Attan'', a dance with ancient pagan roots, that was later modified by Islamic mysticism in some regions, and has become the national dance of Afghanistan.<ref name="Attan">[http://www.virtualafghans.com/attan/ Attan: Afghanistan's National Dance], ''Virtual Afghans.com'' (retrieved 18 January 2007)</ref> A rigorous exercise, the Attan is performed as musicians play various native instruments including the ''[[dhol]]'' (drums), ''[[tabla]]s'' (percussions), ''[[Afghan Rubab|rubab]]'' (a bowed string instrument), and ''toola'' (wooden flute). Involving a rapid circular motion, dancers perform until no one is left dancing in a fashion similar to [[sufi]] [[whirling dervishes]]. Numerous other dances are affiliated with various tribes including the ''Khattak Wal Atanrh'' (eponymously named after the [[Khattak]] tribe), ''Mahsood Wal Atanrh'' (which, in modern times, involves the juggling of loaded rifles), and ''Waziro Atanrh'' among others. A sub-type of the ''Khattak Wal Atanrh'' known as the ''Braghoni'' involves the use of up to three swords and requires great skill to successfully execute. Though most dances are dominated by males, some dance performances such as the ''Spin Takray'' feature female dancers.<ref name="Pashtoon dances">[http://www.khyber.org/culture/atan/atan.shtml Khyber.org: Traditional Dances of Pashtoons], ''Khyber.org'' (retrieved 18 January 2007)</ref> Additionally, young women and girls often entertain at weddings with the ''Tumbal'' (tambourine). 

Traditional Pashtun music has ties to ''[[Klasik]]'' (traditional Afghan music heavily inspired by [[Indian classical music]]), [[Iranian music]]al traditions, and other various forms found in [[South Asia]]. Popular forms include the [[ghazal]] (sung poetry) and [[Sufi]] [[qawwali]] music.<ref name="Pashto Music">[http://www.afghan-web.com/culture/music/pashtosongs.html  Traditional Pashto Music], ''Afghanistan Online'' (retrieved 18 January 2007)</ref> General themes tend to revolve around love and religious introspection. Modern Pashto music is currently centered around the city of Peshawar due to the various wars in Afghanistan and tends to combine indigenous techniques and instruments with Iranian-inspired [[Persian music]] and Indian [[Filmi]] music prominent in [[Bollywood]].<ref name="Pashto Music2">[http://www.batkhela.com/music/ ''PashtoMusic.net''] (retrieved 18 January 2007)</ref>

Other modern Pashtun media include an established Pashto language film and tv industry that is based in Pakistan. Producers based in [[Lahore]] have created Pashto language films since the 1970s. Pashto films were once popular, but have declined both commercially and critically in recent years.<ref name="Pashto Movies">[http://www.khyber.org/video/ Pashto Movies & Video Clips], ''Khyber.org'' (retrieved 18 January 2007)</ref> Past films such as ''Yusuf Khan Sherbano'' dealt with serious subject matter, traditional stories, and legends, but the Pashto film industry has, since the 1980s, been accused of churning out increasingly lewd [[Exploitation film|exploitation]]-style films.<ref name="Exploitation films">[http://www.khyber.org/articles/2003/PashtoCinema-Craziness.shtml Pashto Cinema-Craziness], ''Khyber.org'' (retrieved 18 January 2007)</ref><ref name="Pushto Movies">[http://www.thehotspotonline.com/blahblah/articles/pushto.htm The Sublime and Surreal World of Pushto Movies], ''The Hot Spot Online'' (retrieved 18 January 2007)</ref> Pashtun lifestyle and issues have been raised by Western and Pashtun expatriate film-makers in recent years. Notable films about the Pashtun experience include British film-maker [[Michael Winterbottom]]'s ''[[In This World]]'',<ref name="Indiewire">[http://www.indiewire.com/people/people_030918winter.html Michael Winterbottom Talks About His Tragic Road Movie, "In This World"], ''Indiewire.com'' (retrieved 18 January 2007)</ref> which chronicles the struggles of two Afghan youths who leave their refugee camps in Pakistan and attempt to move to the [[United Kingdom]] in search of a better life, and the British mini-series ''[[Traffik]]'' (re-made as ''[[Traffic (2000 film)|Traffic]]'' for US audiences) which featured a Pashtun man (played by [[Jamal Shah]]) struggling to survive in a world with few opportunities outside the drug trade.<ref name="IMDB">[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096716/ Traffik], ''IMDB'' (retrieved 18 January 2007)</ref> In addition, numerous actors of Pashtun descent also work in India's [[Bollywood]] film industry including [[Kader Khan]] and [[Feroz Khan]].

==Institutions==
{{for|a list of tribal groupings|Pashtun tribes}}

A prominent institution of the Pashtun people is the intricate system of tribes. The Pashtuns remain a predominantly tribal people, but the world-wide trend of urbanization has begun to alter Pashtun society as cities such as Peshawar and Quetta have grown rapidly due to the influx of rural Pashtuns and Afghan refugees.<ref name="MIT">[http://web.mit.edu/cis/www/migration/pubs/rrwp/14_ethno-religious.html How Ethno-Religious Identity Influences the Living Conditions of Hazara and Pashtun Refugees in Peshawar, Pakistan], ''Department of Urban Studies and Planning, MIT'' (retrieved 10 October 2006)</ref> Many still identify themselves with various [[clan]]s despite this trend towards urbanization.

More precisely, there are several levels of organization within the Pashtun tribal system: the ''[[Tabar]]'' (tribe) is subdivided into kinship groups called ''[[Khel]]s''. The ''Khel'' in turn is divided into smaller groups (''[[Pllarina]]'' or ''Plarganey''), each of which consists of several extended families or ''[[Kahols]]''.<ref name="Jirga">[http://unpan1.un.org/intradoc/groups/public/documents/APCITY/UNPAN017434.pdf Jirga - A Traditional Mechanism of Conflict Resolution in Afghanistan] by Ali Wardak, ''un.org'' (2003), p.7 (retrieved 10 October 2006)</ref> "A large tribe often has dozens of sub-tribes whose members may see themselves as belonging to each, some, or all of the sub-tribes in different social situations (co-operative, competitive, confrontational) and identify with each accordingly."<ref name="Jirga"/> Pashtun tribes are divided into four 'greater' tribal groups: [[Sarbans]], [[Qais Abdur Rashid|Batans]], [[Qais Abdur Rashid|Ghurghusht]] and [[Qais Abdur Rashid|Karlans]].

In addition to the tribal hierarchy, another prominent Pashtun institution is that of the ''[[Jirga]]'' or 'Senate' of elected [[Elder (administrative title)|elder]]s and wise men. Most decisions in tribal life are made by members of the Jirga, which is the main institution of authority that the largely egalitarian Pashtuns willingly acknowledge as a viable governing body.<ref name="HRW">[http://hrw.org/press/2002/04/qna-loyagirga.htm Q & A on Afghanistan's Loya Jirga Process], ''[[Human Rights Watch]]'' (retrieved 10 October 2006)</ref>

Pashtuns often observe special occasions upon which to celebrate and/or commemorate events, which are also quite often national holidays in Pakistan and Afghanistan. A common [[Turko-Iranian]] celebration known as ''[[Nouruz]]'' (or New Year) is often observed by Pashtuns.<ref name="Noruz">[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9056297/Noruz Noruz], ''[[Encyclopaedia Britannica]]'' (retrieved 10 October 2006)</ref> Most prominent are [[Muslim holidays]] including ''[[Ramadan]]'' and ''[[Eid al-Fitr]]''. Muslim holidays tend to be the most widely observed and commercial activity can come to a halt as large extended families gather together in what is often both a religious duty and a festive celebration.

==Women==
[[Image:Afghan woman Pashtun.jpg|thumb|300px|left|A Pashtun woman in Kabul, Afghanistan.]]
The lives of Pashtun women vary from those who reside in conservative rural areas, such as the [[Federally Administered Tribal Areas|tribal belt]], to those found in relatively freer urban centers.<ref name="Women's Rights">[http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/people/features/ihavearightto/four_b/report-azami.shtml I have a right to], ''BBC World Service'', Fri January 16, 2006 (retrieved 10 October 2006)</ref> Though many Pashtun women remain tribal and illiterate, others have become educated and gainfully employed.<ref name="Women's Rights"/> The ravages of the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan and the [[Wars in Afghanistan|Afghan wars]], leading to the rise and fall of the Taliban, caused considerable hardship amongst Pashtun women as many of their rights were curtailed in favor of a rigid interpretation of [[Wahabbism|Islamic law]]. The difficult lives of Afghan female refugees gained considerable notriety with the iconic image of the so-called "Afghan Girl" ([[Sharbat Gula]]) depicted on the June 1985 cover of [[National Geographic Magazine]].<ref name="Sharbat Gula">[http://www.nationalgeographic.com/ngm/100best/storyA_story.html Along Afghanistan's War-torn Frontier], ''National Geographic'', June 1985 (retrieved 10 October 2006)</ref> In addition, the male-dominated code of ''Pashtunwali'' often constrains women and forces them into designated traditional roles that separate the genders.<ref name="Women and Pashtunwali"/><ref name="Safia Amajan">[http://www.guardian.co.uk/afghanistan/story/0,,1923314,00.html Afghan teacher and public servant gunned down by the Taliban outside her home], ''The Guardian'', Fri January 16, 2006 (retrieved 10 October 2006)</ref> The pace of change and reform for women has been slow as a result of the wars in Afghanistan and the isolation and instability of tribal life in Pakistan.  

Modern social reform for Pashtun women began in the 20th century. During the early 20th century, Queen [[Soraya Tarzi]] of Afghanistan was an early feminist leader whose advocacy of social reforms for women was so radical that it led to the fall of her and her husband [[King Amanullah]]'s dynasty.<ref name="Queen Soraya">[http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/SIGNS/journal/issues/v32n1/60219/60219.html Abandoning the Wardrobe and Reclaiming Religion in the Discourse on Afghan Women's Islamic Rights], Leela Jacinto, ''University of Chicago, Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society'' 2006, vol. 32, no. 1 (retrieved 10 October 2006)</ref> Even during the tumultuous Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, civil rights remained an important issue as feminist leader [[Meena Keshwar Kamal]] campaigned for women's rights and founded the Revolutionary Women of Afghanistan (RAWA) in the 1980s.<ref name="RAWA">[http://www.rawa.org/waves.htm Making Waves: Interview with RAWA], ''RAWA.org'', Fri January 16, 2006 (retrieved 10 October 2006)</ref> 

Today, Pashtun women vary from the traditional housewives who live in seclusion to urban workers, some of whom seek or have attained parity with men.<ref name="Women's Rights"/> However, due to numerous social hurdles, the literacy rate for Pashtun women remains considerably lower than that of males.<ref name="Pakistan Education and Gender">[http://www.statpak.gov.pk/depts/pco/statistics/pop_education/pop_education_sex.html Population by Level of Education and Gender], ''Pakistan Census'', Fri January 16, 2006 (retrieved 10 October 2006)</ref><ref name="Afghan women literacy">[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/03/29/world/main683742.shtml Laura Bush Meets Afghan Women], ''CBS News'', Fri January 16, 2006 (retrieved 10 October 2006)</ref> Abuse against women is also widespread and yet is increasingly being challenged by women's rights organizations which find themselves struggling with conservative religious groups as well as government officials in both Pakistan and Afghanistan. According to researcher Benedicte Grima's book ''Performance of Emotion Among Paxtun Women'', "a powerful ethic of forbearance severely limits traditional Pashtun women's ability to mitigate the suffering they acknowledge in their lives."<ref name="Paxtun Women">Grima, Benedicte. 1992.[http://www.amazon.com/Performance-Emotion-Among-Paxtun-Women/dp/0292727569 ''Performance of Emotion Among Paxtun Women''], University of Texas Press. ISBN 0292727569 (retrieved 10 October 2006)</ref>

Pashtun women often have their legal rights curtailed in favor of their husbands or male relatives as well. For example, though women are technically allowed to vote in Afghanistan and Pakistan, many have been kept away from ballot boxes by males.<ref name="BBC Women">[http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/people/features/ihavearightto/four_b/report-azami.shtml I have a right to - Muhammad Dawood Azami: Pashto], ''BBC World Service'' (retrieved 10 October 2006)</ref> Traditionally, Pashtun women have few inheritance rights and are often charged with taking care of large extended families of their spouses.<ref name="Afghan Family">[http://www.gl.iit.edu/govdocs/afghanistan/Family.html Afghanistan Country Study: Family],  ''Government Documents Depository Website, Paul V. Galvin Library, Illinois Institute of Technology'' (retrieved 10 October 2006)</ref> Another tradition that persists is ''swara'', a practice that involves giving a female relative to someone in order to rectify a dispute.

Despite obstacles, many Pashtun women have begun a process of slow change. While most Pashtun women are illiterate, a rich [[oral tradition]] and resurgence of poetry has been inspirational to many Pashtun women seeking to learn to read and write.<ref name="Pashtun poetess"/> As a sign of further female emancipation, a Pashtun woman recently became one of the first female fighter pilots in Pakistan's Air force.<ref name="BBC First Female Pilots">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4533367.stm Pakistan's first women fighter pilots], Zaffar Abbas, ''BBC News'', 11 May 2005 (retrieved 10 October 2006)</ref> In addition, numerous Pashtun women have attained high political office both in Pakistan and, following recent elections, in Afghanistan, where the percentage of female representatives is one of the highest in the world.<ref name="BBC Warlords">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/4434782.stm Warlords and women in uneasy mix], Andrew North, ''BBC News'', 14 November 2005 (retrieved 10 October 2006)</ref> Substantial work remains though for Pashtun women who hope to gain equal rights with men who remain disproportionately dominant in most aspects of Pashtun society. Human rights organizations, including the [[Afghan Women's Network]], continue to struggle for greater [[women's rights]] as does the [[Aurat Foundation]] in Pakistan, which attempts to safeguard women from domestic abuse.<ref name="AWN">[http://www.afghanwomensnetwork.org/index.php?q=node/32 About AWN], ''Afghan Women's Network''  (retrieved 10 October 2006)</ref><ref name="Aurat">[http://www.brain.net.pk/~apisf/ Aurat Publication and Information Service Foundation], ''Aurat Foundation'', Fri January 16, 2006 (retrieved 10 October 2006)</ref>
