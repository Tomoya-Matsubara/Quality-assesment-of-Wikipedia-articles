'''Logan Fontenelle''' (1825 <U+2013> July 16, 1855), also known as '''''Shon-ga-ska''''' (White Horse), was a trader of [[French people|French]] and [[Omaha]] ancestry, who served for years as an interpreter to the US Indian agent at the [[Fontenelle's Post|Bellevue Agency]] in Nebraska. He was especially important during the negotiations with Omaha leaders in 1853-1854 about ceding land to the United States prior to settlement on a [[Indian reservation|reservation]]. His mother was a daughter of [[Big Elk]], the principal chief, and his father was a respected French-American [[fur trader]].
 
European Americans thought Fontenelle was a chief, but he was never adopted into the Omaha. As they had a [[patrilineal]] system, because of his white father, adoption would have been the only way he could have advanced to chief.<ref name="TrueLogan"/> The Omaha considered him a [[half-breed]] and, because of his father, a "white man."<ref name="TrueLogan"/> Fontenelle lived on the reservation and died young at the age of 30, killed with five Omaha by an enemy band of [[Sioux]] while on the tribal summer buffalo hunting trip.

Fontenelle acted as an interpreter in Omaha negotiations during 1853-1854 for land cessions, first in Nebraska, with 60 Omaha men and the US Indian agent Gatewood; they came to agreement in January 1854. Later that year, Fontenelle accompanied a delegation of seven [[gente]] chiefs of the Omaha who went to Washington, DC for further talks. Fontenelle was one of the signatories of the treaty, perhaps because he was the only Omaha speaker who was literate in English. Forced to accept changes to the treaty, the Omaha signed on that trip to cede {{convert|4000000|acre|km2}} of their land to the United States, believing they were securing protection from the Sioux. Within a couple of years, the Omaha removed to a reservation in northeast Nebraska in the Blackbird Hills, essentially present-day [[Thurston County, Nebraska|Thurston County]].

==Biography==
=== Early years ===
Logan Fontenelle was born at [[Fort Atkinson (Nebraska)|Fort Atkinson]], [[Nebraska Territory]] in 1825.<ref>Morton, J.S. and Watkins, A. "Chapter 2: Aboriginal Inhabitants." ''History of Nebraska; From the Earliest Explorations of the Trans-Mississippi Region''. Lincoln, NE: Western Publishing and Engraving Company. p. 32.</ref>  He was the oldest son of four born to ''Me-um-bane,'' a daughter of the Omaha principal chief [[Big Elk]] (1770-1846/1853), and her husband [[Fontenelle's Post|Lucien Fontenelle]], a [[Louisiana Creole people|French Creole]] [[fur trader]] from [[New Orleans]]. Their other children were Albert (b. 1827), Tecumseh (b. 1829) (named after the [[Tecumseh|Shawnee chief]]), Henry (b. 1831) and Susan (b. 1833).<ref>[http://www.lewisandclarktravel.com/index.php/site/escape_from_death_and_a_sisters_revenge_the_daughters_of_omaha_chief_big_el Kira Gale,  "Escape from Death and a Sister<U+2019>s Revenge: the Daughters of Omaha Chief Big Elk"], Kira Gale Blog at Lewis and Clark Road Trips, 13 April 2007, accessed 30 November 2011</ref> The senior Fontenelle sent his sons to [[St. Louis, Missouri]] for European-American schooling. His daughter Susan was educated at home with her mother and family.

In 1828, Lucien Fontenelle purchased the former Pilcher's Post, becoming the agent at what became known as [[Fontenelle's Post]]. He represented the [[American Fur Company]] on the [[Missouri River]] in what developed as [[Bellevue, Nebraska|Bellevue]], [[Sarpy County, Nebraska]]. In 1832, with the fur trade declining sharply, Fontenelle sold the post to the US government. 

It used the complex for the headquarters of the regional Indian agency, called the Upper Missouri Indian Agency or Bellevue Agency, which administered relations with the Omaha and other regional tribes. In the following decades, the Indian agent had the lead for negotiating with regional tribes for land cessions for sale to American settlers.

=== Return to Nebraska ===
After his father died in 1840, the 15-year-old Logan Fontenelle returned from St. Louis to Nebraska, where he began to work as an interpreter for the US [[Indian Agent]] at the Bellevue Agency. He also worked as a trader. Several years later, in August 1846 he acted as an interpreter for [[Big Elk]] when he signed an illegal treaty with [[Brigham Young]] to allow the [[Mormon pioneers]] to create [[Cutler's Park|a settlement]] on Omaha territorial lands. (The United States wanted to be a party to all treaties related to Native American territory.) Not having guns, the tribal leaders were seeking aid from the Mormons for protection from the [[Sioux]], who had been raiding them. They likely thought it a bad deal in the end, as the Mormons consumed many of their local resources and did little to protect them.<ref name="Boughter">[http://books.google.com/books?id=TzmMfX_RMusC&dq=Betraying+the+Omaha+Nation%2C+1790-1916.&q=Logan+Fontenelle#v=snippet&q=Logan%20Fontenelle&f=false Judith A. Boughter, ''Betraying the Omaha Nation, 1790-1916''], University of Oklahoma Press, 1998, p. 49</ref> 

Fontenelle allied with the future Omaha chief [[Joseph La Flesche]] (1822<U+2013>1888), a [[M<U+00E9>tis people (United States)|M<U+00E9>tis]] [[fur trader]] who had been adopted as a son of the principal chief [[Big Elk]]. About 1848, the Omaha removed to the Bellevue Agency. By that time designated by Big Elk as his successor, LaFlesche brought his family to settle with the tribe.  

About this time, LaFlesche and Fontenelle established a ferry over the [[Platte River]] near the present-day site of [[Columbus, Nebraska]] to accommodate the increasing migrant traffic. Later, they started another ferry over the [[Elkhorn River]] near [[Fremont, Nebraska]]. After making a profit, they sold the ferries to English immigrants.<ref name="Friend">[http://books.google.com/books?id=8zwrAAAAYAAJ&q=Logan+Fontenelle#v=onepage&q=Logan%20Fontenelle&f=false "Joseph La Flesche: Sketch of the Life of the Head Chief of the Omaha"], first published in the (Bancroft, Nebraska) ''Journal''; reprinted in ''The Friend'', 1889, Vol. 62, p. 274, accessed 23 August 2011</ref>

=== Treaty negotiations ===

The US Indian Agent [[James M. Gatewood]] had been under pressure by the government to gain a land cession from the Omaha. In turn, they wanted protection by the US government against the [[Sioux]], who made frequent raids on them, and economic means to ensure their future.<ref name="Boughter pp. 61-62">Boughter, ''Betraying the Omaha,'' pp. 61-62</ref>  In January 1854, 60 Omaha leaders met in council to discuss the treaty; they were reluctant to delegate so important a matter even to their [[gente]] chiefs. Together, the large group of men negotiated a treaty with the US Indian Agent Gatewood. Fontenelle acted as the interpreter. The treaty included provision for payments of tribal debts to the traders Fontenelle, Louis Saunsouci, and Peter Sarpy.<ref name="Boughter pp. 61-62"/> 

The Omaha finally designated seven chiefs: Joseph LaFlesche (Iron Eye), Two Grizzly Bears, Standing Hawk, Little Chief, Village Maker, Noise, and Yellow Smoke to represent them and accompany Gatewood to Washington to conclude the negotiations, but authorized little room for changes.<ref name="Boughter pp. 61-62"/> Fontenelle and Saunsouci went with the chiefs as interpreters.<ref name="TrueLogan"/><ref name="Boughter pp. 61-62"/> [[Joseph LaFlesche]] had been designated by Big Elk as his successor and in 1853 had become chief of the ''Wezhinshte'' gens.<ref name="TrueLogan"/> Both he and Fontenelle signed the Treaty of 1854, together with five [[gente]] chiefs, whereby the tribe sold nearly all its land to the government.<ref name="Boughter p. 66">Boughter, Betraying the Omaha, p. 66</ref>  

The reservation was established on land in the Blackbird Hills, comprising present-day [[Thurston County, Nebraska|Thurston County]]. The terms were changed by the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] to be less favorable than those negotiated by Gatewood and the 60 Omaha in Nebraska.<ref name="Boughter p. 66"/> Among the changes: Omaha were to receive considerably less money for their land, and the President was to have the discretion to distribute the annuities in cash or goods, rather than all in cash as the Omaha wanted.<ref name="Boughter p. 66"/>  Payments were to be made until 1895. 

About 800 Omaha removed to the reservation, and their number increased over the following decades to 1100 in 1881.<ref name=Andreas/>  Under the treaty terms, the Omaha tribe received "$40,000 per annum for three years from January 1, 1855; $30,000 per annum for the next succeeding ten years; $20,000 per annum for the next succeeding fifteen years; and $10,000 per annum for the next succeeding twelve years," to 1895.<ref name=Andreas/>  The President of the United States, based on recommendations by the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs|US Indian Office]] (and the agent in the field, who had the most authority in the matter), was to determine the proportions of the annuity to be received in money and in goods.<ref name=Andreas>[http://www.kancoll.org/books/andreas_ne/blackbird/blackbird-p1.html  "Blackbird County"], in A. T. Andreas, ''History of the State of Nebraska,'' Wm. G. Cutler, 1882, The Kansas Collection, accessed 20 August 2011</ref>

=== Death ===
In 1855 a band of [[Brul<U+00E9>]] Sioux killed and scalped Fontenelle and five of his party, who were part of the Omaha summer buffalo hunt, along Beaver Creek in present-day [[Boone County, Nebraska]].<ref>Hyde, G. (1988) ''The Pawnee Indians (Civilization of the American Indian Series)''. University of Oklahoma Press. p. 242</ref><ref>(nd) [http://www.nebraskahistory.org/publish/markers/texts/logan_fontenelle.htm "Logan Fontenelle"], Nebraska State Historical Society, Retrieved 6/22/07.</ref> John Bigelk, nephew of Big Elk, described the Sioux attack: "They killed the white man, the interpreter, who was with us."<ref name="TrueLogan"/> As the historian Melvin Randolph Gilmore has noted, Bigelk called Fontenelle
<blockquote>"a white man because he had a white father. This was a common designation of [[mixed-race|half-breeds]] by full-bloods, just as a [[mulatto]] might commonly be called a [black] by white people, although as much white as black by race."<ref name="TrueLogan"/></blockquote>Because the tribe was [[patrilineal]], it considered children's social identity to be tied to that of their father.

== Chiefdom dispute ==

Some historians contend that Fontenelle was made a chief of the Omaha in 1853 after the death of Big Elk. This assertion is contradicted by contemporary accounts that Fontenelle was respected, but only the whites thought he was a chief. They were the only ones to commemorate him after his death.<ref name="TrueLogan"/> 

It appears confusion arose because he accompanied the chiefs to Washington, DC as an interpreter. The [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] (BIA) also used Saunsouci as an interpreter. For some reason, the officials included Fontenelle's name as one of the seven chiefs on the treaty, which he signed, but the name of chief Two Grizzly Bears was not included, nor did he sign. Fontenelle was the only one of the group who was literate and could read what was on the treaty.<ref name="TrueLogan">[http://www.usgennet.org/usa/ne/topic/resources/OLLibrary/collections/vol19/v19p064.htm  Melvin Randolph Gilmore, "The True Logan Fontenelle"], ''Publications of the Nebraska State Historical Society,'' Vol. 19, edited by Albert Watkins, Nebraska State Historical Society, 1919, pp. 64-65, at GenNet, accessed 25 August 2011</ref> Boughter suggests that Gatewood may have represented him to the BIA officials as a chief, or the Omaha did to increase his stature. He may have been recognized as a chief because of "charitable acts" and gifts to the tribe.<ref name="Boughter p. 66"/> 

An 1889 sketch of [[Joseph LaFlesche]] in the Bancroft ''Journal'' said he was the only chief of the Omaha to have had any European blood; as noted, he was adopted as a son by Big Elk, which was the way he fully entered the tribe.<ref name="Friend"/> Although A. T. Andreas called Fontenelle the "last great chief" of the Omaha in his 1882 history of Nebraska,<ref name=Andreas/> the assertion of chieftainship is not supported by the evidence of tribal structure and contemporary views provided in 1919 by Melvin R. Gilmore, curator of the State Historical Society of North Dakota and the 20th-century historian Judith Boughter; it appears that only the whites thought Fontenelle was a chief in his own lifetime and during the decades after his death.<ref name="TrueLogan"/> As Gilmore noted, the Omaha had a tribal structure that had [[patrilineal]] hereditary leadership; because children belonged to their father's [[gens]], there was no place in the tribe for a child fathered by a European or American, unless the person was officially adopted by a person in the tribe.<ref name="TrueLogan"/>

==Legacy==
As European Americans overestimated Fontenelle's influence in the tribe, they honored him with several place names and a monument:
* [[Fontenelle Forest]] in [[Bellevue, Nebraska|Bellevue]]
* [[Fontenelle Boulevard]] in Omaha was designed to take drivers to the town of [[Fontenelle, Nebraska]] in [[Washington County, Nebraska|Washington County]]. The town was named for Fontenelle after he led a party of white settlers from Illinois to that town's location on a scouting party for land.<ref name="Logan">(nd) [http://www.nde.state.ne.us/SS/notables/fontenelle.html Logan Fontenelle].
