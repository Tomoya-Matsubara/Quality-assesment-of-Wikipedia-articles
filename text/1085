The '''Temple of Eshmun''' ({{lang-ar|<U+0645><U+0639><U+0628><U+062F> <U+0627><U+0634><U+0645><U+0648><U+0646>}}) dedicated to [[Eshmun]], the [[Phoenecian]] god of healing, is situated by the [[Awali (river)|Awali river]], {{convert|2|km|mi}} northeast of [[Sidon]] in southwestern [[Lebanon]]. The site was occupied from the 7th century BCE to the 8th century CE, suggesting an integrated relationship with the nearby city of Sidon. Although originally constructed by Sidonian king [[Eshmunazar]] II in the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid era]] ({{circa}} 529<U+2013>333 BCE) to celebrate the city's recovered wealth and stature, the temple complex was greatly expanded by Bodashtart, Yatan-milk and later monarchs. Due to the expansion works spanning many centuries of alternating independence and foreign [[hegemony]], the sanctuary features a wealth of different architectural and decorative styles and influences.

The sanctuary consists of an [[esplanade]] and a grand court limited by a huge [[limestone]] terrace wall that supports a monumental [[podium]] which was once topped by Eshmun's Graeco-Persian style [[marble]] temple. The sanctuary features a series of ritual [[Ritual purification|ablution]] basins fed by canals channeling water from the Asclepius river (modern [[Awali (river)|Awali]]) and from the sacred "Ydll" spring;<ref group="nb">The [[Phoenicians]] did not mark [[Vowel|vowels]] at all until the [[Punics|Punics]] fitfully added a system of [[Matres lectionis|matres lectionis]] (vowel letters); for this reason the Phoenician inscription "Ydll" may be transcribed with a number of variant spellings (Yidlal, Yadlol etc.)    Franz L.

The sanctuary site has yielded many artifacts of value, especially those inscribed with [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician texts]], providing valuable insight into the site's history and that of ancient Sidon.

The Eshmun Temple declined and fell into oblivion as [[paganism]] was overrun by [[Early Christianity|Christianity]] and its large limestone blocks were used to build later structures. The temple site was rediscovered in 1900 by local [[Treasure hunting|treasure hunters]] who stirred the curiosity of international scholars. Maurice Dunand, a French archaeologist, thoroughly excavated the site from 1963 until the beginning of the [[Lebanese Civil War]] in 1975. After the end of the hostilities and the retreat of [[Israel]] from [[South Lebanon]], the site was rehabilitated and inscribed to the [[World Heritage Site]] tentative list.

==Eshmun==
{{Main|Eshmun}}

Eshmun was the Phoenician god of healing and renewal of life; he was one of the most important divinities of the Phoenician [[Pantheon (gods)|pantheon]] and the main male divinity of [[Sidon]]. Originally a nature divinity, and a god of spring vegetation, Eshmun was equated to [[Babylonian]] deity [[Tammuz (deity)|Tammuz]]. His role later expanded within the Phoenician pantheon, and he gained celestial and cosmic attributes.<ref name="JWA">{{Cite book | publisher = Kessinger Publishing | isbn = 0766176711, 9780766176713 | pages = 136<U+2013>140 | last = Walter Addison | first = Jane | title = Healing Gods of Ancient Civilizations | year = 2003 }}</ref>

The myth of Eshmun was related by the 6th century CE [[Syria|Syrian]] [[Neoplatonism|philosopher]] [[Damascius]] and 9th century CE [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch]] of [[Constantinople]] [[Photios I of Constantinople|Photius]]. They recount that Eshmun, a young man from [[Beirut]], was hunting in the woods when [[Astarte]] saw him and was stricken by his beauty. She harassed him with her amorous pursuit until he  [[Emasculation|emasculated]] himself with an [[axe]] and died. The grieving goddess revived Eshmun and transported him to the heavens where she made him into a [[Heaven|uranic]] god.<ref group="nb">in [[Damascius]]<U+2019> ''Life of Isidore'' and Photius'  ''Bibliotheca Codex 242''</ref><ref name = "wmb"/>

From a historical perspective, the first written mention of Eshmun goes back to 754 BCE, the date of the signing of the treaty between [[Assyria]]n king [[Ashur-nirari V]] and Mati'el, king of [[Arpad (Syria)|Arpad]]; Eshmun figures in the text as a patron of the treaty.<ref name="ddup"/>
Eshmun was identified with [[Asclepius]] as a result of the [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenic]] influence over Phoenicia; the earliest evidence of this equation is given by coins from [[Amrit]] and [[Acre, Israel|Acre]] from the 3rd century BCE. This fact is exemplified by the Hellenized names of the [[Awali (river)|Awali]] river which was dubbed ''Asclepius fluvius'', and the Eshmun Temple<U+2019>s surrounding groves, known as the groves of Asclepius.<ref name= "JWA" />

==History==
===Historical background===
In the 9th century BCE, the [[Assyria]]n king [[Ashurnasirpal II]] conquered [[Mount Lebanon|the Lebanon]] mountain range and its coastal cities. The new sovereigns exacted tribute from Sidon, along with every other [[Phoenicia]]n city. These payments stimulated Sidon<U+2019>s search for new means of provisioning and furthered Phoenician emigration and expansion, which peaked in the 8th century BCE.<ref name="ddup"/>
When Assyrian king [[Sargon II]] died in 705 BCE, the Sidonian king [[Luli]] joined with the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]] and [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]] in an unsuccessful rebellion against Assyrian rule,<ref name="teoh">{{Cite book | edition = 6, illustrated | publisher = Houghton Mifflin Harcourt | isbn = 9780395652374 | page = 36 | last = Stearns | first = Peter | authorlink = Peter Stearns | coauthors = William Leonard Langer | title = The Encyclopedia of world history: ancient, medieval, and modern, chronologically arranged | year = 2001 }}</ref> but was forced to flee to [[Kition]] (modern [[Larnaca]] in [[Cyprus]]) with the arrival of the Assyrian army headed by [[Sennacherib]], Sargon II's son and successor. Sennacherib instated [[Ittobaal]] on the throne of Sidon and reimposed the annual tribute.<ref name="teoh"/> 
When [[Abdi-Milkutti]] ascended to Sidon's throne in 680, he also rebelled against the Assyrians. In response, the Assyrian king [[Esarhaddon]] laid siege to the city. Abdi-Milkutti was captured and beheaded in 677 BCE after a three-year siege, while his city was destroyed and renamed Kar-Ashur-aha-iddina (the harbor of Esarhaddon). Sidon was stripped of its territory, which was awarded to [[Baal I]], the king of rival [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] and loyal [[vassal]] to Esarhaddon.<ref name="ddup"/><ref name="bible"/> Baal I and Esarhaddon signed a [[treaty]] in 675 in which Eshmun<U+2019>s name features as one of the deities invoked as guarantors of the covenant.<ref group="nb">Eshmun's name is transcribed in Akkadian as  <U+201C>''Ia-su-mu-nu''<U+201D>  in the Esarhaddon treaty</ref><ref name = "wmb">{{Cite book | publisher = Wm.

Sidon returned to its former level of prosperity while Tyre was besieged for 13&nbsp;years (586<U+2013>573 BCE) by the [[Chaldea]]n king [[Nebuchadnezzar II]].<ref name = "west">{{Cite book | edition = 2, illustrated, revised | publisher = Cambridge University Press | isbn = 9780521795432 | pages = 58<U+2013>60 | last = Aubet | first = Mar<U+00ED>a Eugenia | title = The Phoenicians and the West: politics, colonies and trade | year = 2001 }}</ref> Nevertheless, the Sidonian king was still held in exile at the court of [[Babylon]].<ref name="ddup"/><ref name = "ANET" >{{Cite book | edition = 3 | publisher = Princeton University Press | isbn = 9780835788014  | last = Pritchard | first = James B.| title = Ancient Near Eastern Texts: Relating to the Old Testament | year = 1992 }}</ref> Sidon reclaimed its former standing as Phoenicia<U+2019>s chief city in the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid era]] ({{circa}} 529<U+2013>333 BCE).

===Decline===
The first hit to the Eshmun sanctuary was by an earthquake in the 4th century BCE, which demolished the marble temple atop the podium; this structure was not rebuilt but many chapels and temples were later annexed at the base of the podium.<ref name = "paul"/><ref name = "NJ">{{Cite book | publisher = Dar el Mashreq | isbn = N/A | last = Jidejian | first = Nina | title = Sidon, through the ages | year = 1971 | unused_data = <!-- pages = 287 --> }}</ref> The temple site remained a place of pilgrimage in the [[Ancient history|ancient world]] until the advent of [[Christianity]], when the cult of Eshmun was banned and a [[Christian church]] was built at the temple site across the [[Roman roads|Roman street]] from the podium.<ref name = "GB">{{Cite book | edition = illustrated | publisher = University of Michigan | isbn = N/A | last = Barraclough | first = Geoffrey | authorlink =Geoffrey Barraclough| title = The Christian world: a social and cultural history | year = 1981}}</ref><ref name = "NJ"/> Remnants and mosaic floors of the [[Byzantine]] church can still be seen on the site. Another earthquake hit Sidon around 570 CE; [[Antoninus of Piacenza|Antonin de Plaisance]], an Italian Christian pilgrim, described the city as partly in ruins.

==Function==
Eshmun<U+2019>s cult enjoyed a particular importance at Sidon as he was the chief deity after 500 BCE. Aside from the extramural sanctuary at Bustan el-Sheikh, Eshmun also had a temple within the city. The extramural Eshmun Temple was associated with purification and healing; ritual lustral ablutions were performed in the sanctuary<U+2019>s sacred basins supplemented by running water from the Asclepius River and the <U+201D>Ydll<U+201D> spring water which was considered to have a sacred character and therapeutic quality.<ref name = "wmb"/><ref name= "RR">{{Cite journal | issn = 1988-9100 | volume = 1 | pages = 21<U+2013>40 | last = Rodriguez | first = Raquel | title = El uso c<U+00FA>ltico del agua en el mundo fenicio y P<U+00FA>nico.

During the civil war, upon a request from then Lebanese director general of antiquities Maurice Chehab, Maurice Dunand moved more than 2000 artifacts from Sidon to a subterranean chamber at the [[Byblos Castle|Byblos crusader castle]], {{convert|30|km|mi}} north of Beirut. In 1981, the depot was looted and around 600 sculptures and architectural elements were stolen and smuggled out of Lebanon. Rolf Stucky, ex-director of the Institute of Classical Archeology of [[Basel]] affirmed during a conference in Beirut in December 2009 the successful identification and return of eight sculptures to the Lebanese national museum.<ref name="LOLJ"/>
