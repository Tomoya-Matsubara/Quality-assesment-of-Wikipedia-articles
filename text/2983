The '''Lambeth Homilies''' are a collection of [[Homily|homilies]] found in a manuscript (MS Lambeth 487) in the [[Lambeth_Palace#Lambeth_Palace_Library|Lambeth Palace Library]] in [[Canterbury]], England. The collection contains seventeen sermons and is notable for being one of the latest examples of [[Old English]], written as it was c. 1200, well into the period of [[Middle English]].<ref name=sisam>{{cite journal|last=Sisam|first=Celia|year=1951|title=The Scribal Tradition of the ''Lambeth Homilies''|journal=[[The Review of English Studies]]|volume=2 n.s.|issue=6|pages=105<U+2013>13|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/511023}}</ref>

==Date and provenance==
Julius P. Gilson of the British Museum dated the manuscript 1185<U+2013>1225.<ref name=sisam/> It is copied from two very different [[Exemplar (textual criticism)|exemplars]] in different [[Orthography|orthographies]], both from the twelfth century and both from the same area in the [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]]; the older (E) contains eleventh-century documents transliterated into Middle English; the newer (L) contains only Middle English texts.<ref name=Trips>{{cite book|last=Trips|first=Carola|title=From Ov to Vo in Early Middle English|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=zUD_MLxwN_8C&pg=PA22|accessdate=5 September 2012|year=2002|publisher=John Benjamins|isbn=9789027227812|page=22}}</ref> Until R. M. Wilson's 1935 investigation of the dialect, the collection was thought to be written in the [[Middlesex]] dialect of the London area; since Wilson, the West Midlands are generally accepted as its provenance.<ref name=wilson/>

Since the devotional poem which concludes the manuscript ("On Ureisun of ure Louerde") is usually "associated with a group of texts written for or by women", ownership by a thirteenth-century woman is considered a possibility.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.le.ac.uk/english/em1060to1220/mss/EM.Lamb.487.htm|title=London, Lambeth Palace, 487|last=Swan|first=Mary|date=June 2012|work=The Production and Use of English Manuscripts: 1060 to 1220|accessdate=6 September 2012}}</ref> The authoress of a 1929 article could not prove that the author of the Homilies was to be identified as the author of the ''[[Ancrene Wisse]]'', a twelfth-century religious tract written for an audience of female recluses, but considered it a possibility.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Allen|first=Hope Emily|year=1929|title=On the Author of the Ancren Riwle|journal=[[Modern Language Association|Publications of the Modern Language Association]]|volume=44|issue=3|pages=635<U+2013>80|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/457407}}</ref>

==Contents==
According to R. M. Wilson, one of the seventeen sermons (no. 7) is certainly of Middle English origin; two (nos. 9 and 10) are adaptations in Middle English of material originally in Old English. The sermons are followed by an incomplete ''[[Poema Morale]]'' and a likewise unfinished "On Ureisun of ure Louerde", a brief devotional poem.<ref name=wilson>{{cite journal|last=Wilson|first=R.M.|year=1935|title=The Provenance of the Lambeth Homilies with a New Collation|journal=[[Leeds Studies in English]]|volume=4|pages=24<U+2013>43|url=http://ludos.leeds.ac.uk:8881/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&object_id=134404&local_base=GEN01}}</ref> The sermons are written in one hand, by the scribe who also wrote the unfinished part of the ''Poema Morale'', which breaks off on f.65a; a different scribe started the devotional poem on f.65b.<ref name="sisam"/> It shares five sermons (and the ''Poema Morale'') with the [[Trinity Homilies]].<ref name=Trips/>

Sermon no.2 incorporates material from a sermon by [[Wulfstan (died 1023)|Wulfstan]]; sermons 9, 10, and 11 incorporate material by [[<U+00C6>lfric of Eynsham]]. The influence of Parisian schools of rhetoric was discerned in four sermons, and especially (the use of ''distinctiones'') in nos. 13 and 17.<ref name=Edwards/> Recent scholarship has argued that the sermons should not be read as "back-ward looking", but that they rather should be located in "the broader historical developments in preaching and pastoral reform taking place during the late twelfth and early thirteenth centuries", given their interest in addressing a lay as well as a clerical audience.<ref>{{cite book|last=Millett|first=Bella|title=Essays in Manuscript Geography: Vernacular Manuscripts of the English West Midlands from the Conquest to the Sixteenth Century|url=http://eprints.soton.ac.uk/47987/|series=Medieval Texts and Cultures of Northern Europe|volume=10|year=2007|publisher=Brepols|location=Turnhout|pages=43<U+2013>64|chapter=The pastoral context of the Trinity and Lambeth homilies}}</ref>
