The U.S. Open Cup is an annual American soccer competition open to all [[United States Soccer Federation]] affiliated teams, from amateur adult club teams to the professional clubs of [[Major League Soccer]] (MLS).  The 2010 tournament was the 97th edition of the oldest soccer tournament in the United States.<ref name="dispatch_report">{{cite news |url=http://www.dispatch.com/live/content/sports/stories/2010/10/06/crew-falls-in-open-cup-final.html |title=Soccer: Crew falls in Open Cup final |first=Shawn |last=Mitchell |date=October 5, 2010 |newspaper=The Columbus Dispatch |accessdate=October 9, 2010}}</ref>

Each year, MLS, which has teams that play in both the United States and Canada, is allowed to enter eight of its U.S.-based teams in the tournament.  The top six MLS teams from the previous season's league table qualify automatically for the tournament, while the remaining two spots are determined by preliminary [[2010 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup qualification|qualification matches]].

Prior to 2010 the Columbus Crew had been to the U.S. Open Cup final twice, in 1998 and again in 2002, winning the cup in the latter appearance.  On June 29, 2010, the Crew began the competition in the third round, hosting the [[Rochester Rhinos]] of the [[USSF Division 2 Professional League|D2 Pro League]] at [[Columbus Crew Stadium]] in [[Columbus, Ohio]] in front of a crowd of 1,760.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.dispatch.com/live/content/sports/stories/2010/07/02/rumblings-7-2-art-g4e9241s-1.html |title=Bob Hunter commentary: Rumblings ...

A week later, on July 6, Columbus faced the [[Charleston Battery]] of the [[USL Second Division]] in the U.S. Open Cup quarterfinals.  The match was hosted by Columbus, again at Crew Stadium in front of a crowd of 1,847.  In the 37th&nbsp;minute, Lenhart was fouled in the penalty area while going for a cross and the referee signaled for a [[penalty kick]].  Renter<U+00ED>a took the penalty kick and drove a right-footed shot into the back of the net, making the score 1<U+2013>0.  Columbus extended its lead in the 70th minute through a goal from Lenhart, and again in the 87th&nbsp;minute when Gaven scored off of a pass from [[Emmanuel Ekpo]].

In the 98th minute, the Crew's Lenhart [[Dribbling|dribbled]] the ball into the 18-yard box and was tripped by D.C. United's [[Carey Talley]] to draw a penalty.  [[Guillermo Barros Schelotto]] took the penalty kick and scored the  winning goal.

On June 30, 2010, Seattle began the defense of its title in a match hosted by the [[Portland Timbers (USL)|Portland Timbers]] of the D2 Pro League in Portland, Oregon, at [[PGE Park]] in front of a crowd of 15,422.  Sounders FC took the lead in the 13th&nbsp;minute on a header from [[Nate Jaqua]], but the Timbers levelled the score in the 38th&nbsp;minute when [[Bright Dike]] scored on a shot from inside the [[penalty area]].  The score was 1<U+2013>1 at halftime, and remained that way through full time and extra time.  Seattle finally defeated Portland in a 4<U+2013>3 [[Penalty shootout (association football)|penalty shootout]] with [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] [[Kasey Keller]] making two saves and [[Defender (association football)|defender]] [[Zach Scott]] scoring the winning penalty kick.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/sounders/2012250452_sounders01.html |title=Sounders FC beats Portland 4<U+2013>3 on penalty kicks in U.S. Open Cup |first=Joshua |last=Mayers |date=June 20, 2010 |newspaper=The Seattle Times |accessdate=September 4, 2010}}</ref>

On September 1, 2010, Seattle hosted its semifinal match against another MLS club, [[C.D. Chivas USA|Chivas USA]].  Like the quarterfinal, it was hosted at Starfire with a sellout crowd of 4,547.  Jaqua gained Seattle an early lead in the 10th&nbsp;minute off a [[Steve Zakuani]] cross.

In 2010, prior to meeting in the U.S. Open Cup final, Sounders FC and the Crew met twice in MLS league matches.  The first was played on May 1 at Qwest Field and finished in a 1<U+2013>1 draw.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mlssoccer.com/matchcenter-recap/smash-and-grab-crew-leave-seattle-point |title=Smash-and-grab Crew leave Seattle with a point |date=May 1, 2010 |publisher=Major League Soccer |accessdate=October 3, 2010}}</ref>

===First half===

Seattle had most of the early scoring opportunities.<ref name="MLS_report"/>  Two minutes into the match, Montero took the first shot of the game with a header at close range which was saved by Crew goalkeeper Gruenebaum.  Seconds later, Montero had another shot from distance which went just over the bar.<ref name="US_report"/>  Four minutes later, Seattle [[midfielder]] Zakuani got around Crew defender Frankie Hejduk and passed the ball to Blaise Nkufo whose tap-in attempt was saved by Gruenbaum.<ref name="Sounders_report"/>  In the 12th&nbsp;minute, Gaven took the Crew's first shot of the match but it flew high over the crossbar.<ref name="MLS_report"/><ref name="ST_gamethread"/>  In the 16th&nbsp;minute Zakuani had a run up the middle before passing to Montero, whose shot was again saved by Gruenbaum.<ref name="Sounders_report"/>  Columbus successfully defended crosses from Zakuani and Nkufo in the 18th&nbsp;minute and kept Seattle from getting a shot off.<ref name="ST_gamethread"/>  Columbus nearly took the lead in the 20th&nbsp;minute as Emmanuel Ekpo got behind the defense and made a quick pass back to Gaven, who missed a wide-open shot over the bar.<ref name="ST_gamethread"/>

While Seattle controlled the game for much of the first half, Columbus took the lead on a counterattack movement in the 24th&nbsp;minute.  The play developed on the right side when Hejduk made a low pass to Lenhart from a forward position.  Lenhart touched the ball to Kevin Burns for a low shot inside the far post for a goal.<ref name="Times_report">{{cite news |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/sounders/2013082694_sounders06.html |title=Sounders FC keeps U.S. Open Cup |first=Joshua |last=Mayers |date=October 5, 2010 |newspaper=The Seattle Times |accessdate=October 9, 2010}}</ref><ref name="ESPN_report"/>  Few chances were created after the goal as Columbus' strong defensive play held off Seattle's attacks.<ref name="Sounders_report"/>  In the 34th&nbsp;minute Tyson Wahl crossed the ball into the box but Gruenbaum was able to jump and grab the ball before Nkufo could direct it towards goal with his head.<ref name="Sounders_report"/>

Seattle equalized in the 38th&nbsp;minute. Montero passed to Tyson Wahl, who crossed the ball into the [[Penalty area|18-yard-box]], where Crew goalkeeper Gruenebaum hesitated on how to handle the ball. He knocked it away, and it fell to Nathan Sturgis, who passed the ball between the legs of Gaven to find teammate Sanna Nyassi 18&nbsp;yards out.<ref name="ESPN_report"/><ref name="crew_defense">{{cite web |url=http://www.thecrew.com/news/2010/10/defensive-lapses-doom-crew-bid-second-crown |title=Defensive lapses doom Crew in bid for second crown |first=Craig |last=Merz |date=October 6, 2010 |publisher=Columbus Crew |accessdate=October 9, 2010}}</ref>  Nyassi turned on the ball and shot it past Gruenebaum, who was still out of position.<ref name="Times_report" />  Following the goal few scoring opportunities were created before halftime.<ref name="Sounders_report"/>  After one minute of stoppage time, the first half ended with a tie score, 1<U+2013>1.<ref name="ST_gamethread"/>

===Second half===

Columbus Crew midfielder Kevin Burns commented on the team's attitude after the first half, "We were OK at halftime. Our heads weren<U+2019>t down."<ref name="crew_defense"/> No substitutions were made as the teams returned to the field for the second half.<ref name="ST_gamethread"/>

Despite Seattle's continued control of the tempo of gameplay early in the second half, they were unable to create many scoring opportunities.<ref name="US_report"/> In the 58th&nbsp;minute [[James Riley (soccer)|James Riley]] was alone on the edge of the penalty area after receiving a pass from Montero.  However, Riley's cross was deflected for a corner kick.<ref name="Sounders_report"/>  Two minutes later Seattle's Zakuani created a scoring threat when he received an aerial pass into the penalty area, but Crew goalkeeper Gruenebaum was quick to get to the play causing Zakuani to fall down and the ball to bounce away before being cleared by Columbus.<ref name="Sounders_report"/>  In the 64th&nbsp;minute, Kasey Keller made a diving save to stop Gaven's shot from 30&nbsp;yards out, his fourth [[shot on goal]] in the game.<ref name="MLS_report"/><ref name="Sounders_report"/> Two minutes later, the score line finally changed as Seattle completed 18 consecutive passes.  Montero got open on the right side of the field to receive the 19th and then crossed a ball into the penalty area.<ref name="crew_defense"/>  Gruenebaum decided not to chase the pass as Zakuani ran inside of Crew defender Hejduk and headed a shot that hit the crossbar.  The Crew defenders failed to clear the ball before Nyassi ran in and easily scored the go-ahead goal.<ref name="Times_report" /><ref name="ESPN_report"/>

Zakuani was again on the attack in the 75th&nbsp;minute with a run down the middle, but was "sandwiched" by two Columbus defenders and lost possession.<ref name="Sounders_report"/>  Columbus made two substitutions in the 78th&nbsp;minute, bringing on fresh legs at forward with Renter<U+00ED>a in for Lenhart and swapping midfielder Burns out for forward Andr<U+00E9>s Mendoza.<ref name="ST_gamethread"/>  Shortly after the substitutions, Keller came out to grab a Columbus cross and made a long throw to Montero.  Seattle pushed up the field and Montero took a shot which bounced off of teammate Nkufo's back.<ref name="Sounders_report"/>  In the 81st&nbsp;minute, Crew coach Warzycha made his final substitution bringing on [[Robbie Rogers]] for Gaven.<ref name="MLS_report"/> Shortly after, in the 85th&nbsp;minute, Columbus nearly equalized when Rogers received a pass from Hejduk and took a shot which bounced hard off of the crossbar.<ref name="ESPN_report"/>  

Seattle made its first substitution in the 79th&nbsp;minute when Sanna Nyassi left the field to an ovation from the crowd as he was replaced by [[<U+00C1>lvaro Fern<U+00E1>ndez]].<ref name="ST_gamethread"/>  In the 87th&nbsp;minute, Zakuani ran free on a breakaway but was taken down by Crew forward Barros Schelotto who received a [[Penalty_card#Yellow_card|yellow card]] for the foul.  Montero took the ensuing free kick and shot it on goal with Gruenebaum catching it for the save.<ref name="Sounders_report"/>

The referee added three minutes of stoppage time to the second half.<ref name="ST_gamethread"/>  During that time, Seattle made its remaining two substitutions.  First in the 90th&nbsp;minute Roger Levesque was brought on for Zakuani, and then in the 93rd&nbsp;minute they brought on Jaqua for Montero.<ref name="Sounders_report"/>  The referee blew his whistle ending the game shortly thereafter.  Most of the fans in attendance remained after the game for the presentation of the trophy.<ref name="Borg">{{cite web |url=http://www.thecrew.com/news/2010/10/smorgasborg-usoc-naysayers-go-hiding |title=SmorgasBorg: USOC naysayers go in hiding |first=Simon |last=Borg |date=October 7, 2010 |publisher=Columbus Crew |accessdate=October 9, 2010}}</ref>

==Post-match==
Sounders FC head coach Sigi Schmid discussed the match in the post-game press conference saying:
{{quote|I thought there was some good soccer that was played by both teams. We caught a break at the end when they hit the crossbar. You work hard to make your own luck. We showed a lot of character going down 1<U+2013>0 and coming back. Attitude of our team has been very strong that way. Really proud and what we accomplished tonight is super. It sets us apart and makes us unique and this is the kind of franchise when Adrian [Hanauer], Joe [Roth], Drew [Carey] and Tod Leiweke and the rest of the internal ownership group and everyone else who works at this organization wanted us to be something unique, something special, something different. The fans were fantastic. That's the loudest I've heard this place.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/soundersfcblog/2013082824_sounders_fc_2_columbus_crew_1_1.html |title=Sounders FC 2, Columbus Crew 1 <U+2013> winning team reacts |first=Joshua |last=Mayers |date=October 5, 2010 |newspaper=The Seattle Times |accessdate=December 12, 2010}}</ref>}}  Columbus Crew goalkeeper Andy Gruenbaum commented after the match, "We knew it was going to be a tough place to play, their fan base is great. Anytime you have a championship match on your own pitch, the odds are going to be against you. We knew we had to defend and take advantage of any opportunity. We came out and scored the first goal and they were able to capitalize on two weird bounces."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/soundersfcblog/2013082823_sounders_fc_2_columbus_crew_1.html |title=Sounders FC 2, Columbus Crew 1 <U+2013> visiting team reacts |first=Joshua |last=Mayers |date=October 5, 2010 |newspaper=The Seattle Times |accessdate=December 12, 2010}}</ref>

Seattle Sounders FC is the first MLS club to repeat as the U.S. Open Cup champion and the first club overall to repeat since the [[New York Pancyprian-Freedoms]] did so in 1982 and 1983.
