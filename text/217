'''''Ramones''''' is the debut album by the [[United States|American]] [[punk rock]] band  the [[Ramones]] who are widely cited as the first punk rock group.<ref name=mtvbio>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/music/artist/ramones/artist.jhtml#bio|title=The Ramones|work=[[MTV]].com|accessdate=2008-04-11}}</ref><ref name="HallofFame">{{cite web | url=http://www.rockhall.com/inductee/ramones | date=September 15, 2004 (last update) | title=Ramones | publisher=Rock and Roll Hall of Fame + Museum | accessdate=2007-07-25}}</ref> It was released April 23, 1976 through [[Sire Records]], and  again by [[Rhino Records]] June 19, 2001. The group started recording in February 1976 with a budget of US $20,000, and spent an estimated US $6,400. There were two [[single (music)|singles]] released, neither of which charted. The cover art was ranked number 58 on [[Rolling Stone]]'s list of 100 Greatest Album Covers. The album has been released approximately seven times and peaked at 111 on United States chart ''[[Billboard 200]]''. The album was ranked number 33 on ''Rolling Stone'''s  [[The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time]] and [[VH1]] ranked it number 53 on their ''100 Greatest Albums of Rock & Roll''.

The album features several themes, including  [[Nazism]], violence, and male [[prostitute|prostitution]]. It has fourteen tracks and is twenty-nine minutes and four seconds long. The group covered the song "[[Let's Dance (Chris Montez song)|Let's Dance]]", a [[Chris Montez]] song that was his first single.  Several of the tracks have [[backing vocals]] by Mickey Leigh, [[Tommy Ramone]], and [[executive producer]]/[[Audio engineer|engineer]] Rob Freeman. The album received very high ratings by reviewers, with [[Allmusic]] and [[Rolling Stone|Rolling Stone magazine]], both rewarding it with a maximum rating of five out of five stars. [[Robert Christgau]] gave the album  an [[Grade (education)|A]], writing " For me, it blows everything else off the radio."<ref name="christgau"/>

==Recording and production==
In early 1976, the Ramones began playing at several gigs, and was seen by Linda Stein, the ex-wife Seymour Stein, one of the owners of [[Sire Records]].<ref name="l 126">Leigh 2009 p. 126</ref> Especially praising the song "53rd & 3rd," Linda later discussed the event with Seymour, which lead to the Ramones performing in front of Seymour, [[Craig Leon]], and others from [[Sire Records]].<ref name="l 126"/> After the Ramones signed to Sire Records, they  organized several local shows.<ref name="l 128">{{Harvnb|Leigh|2009|p=128}}</ref> They took a temporary break from their performances, in order to prepare to begin recording at Plaza Sound studio.<ref>Leigh 2009 p. 131</ref> The band had a $20,000 budget (an advance from Sire Records), with which they bought needed equipment <ref name="l 128"/> and began recording in early February 1976.<ref name="l 128"/> <ref name="notes"/>

The album was produced by Craig Leon, and co-produced  by drummer [[Tommy Ramone]].<ref name="l 132">Leigh 2009 p. 132</ref> Conflict arose between guitarist [[Johnny Ramone]] and Tommy Ramone, over the topic of whether to [[Overdubbing|overdub]], a technique used by [[recording studio]]s to add a supplementary recorded sound to a previously recorded performance.<ref name="l 132"/> The main purpose of overdubbing is to give the recording a more "thick" sound. Tommy Ramone was planning on overdubbing, while Johnny Ramone refused to do it.<ref name="l 132"/> The result of the argument was not to overdub.<ref name="l 132"/> The album was released April 23, 1976.<ref>[http://music.blinkx.com/album/the-ramones/CCRq9TMjecaRmmat The Ramones - The Ramones] Retrieved 2010-03-24</ref><ref>[http://www.moma.org/interactives/exhibitions/2009/lookingatmusic2/ramones.html "MoMA | Looking at Music: Side 2 | The Ramones"].

===Album cover===
Before the album's release, the Ramones had planned to make an album cover similar to [[The Beatles]]'s 1964 album ''[[Meet The Beatles!]]''.<ref name="Leigh 138">{{Harvnb|Leigh|2009|p=138}}</ref> [[John Holmstrom]] said that the original idea "came out horribly." The Ramones later met up with Roberta Bayley, at the time a [[photographer]] for ''[[Punk (magazine)|Punk magazine]]'', to make the album's cover.<ref name="Leigh 138"/> Holmstrom also noted that "getting the Ramones to pose was like [[Dental extraction|pulling teeth]]," and also said it turned out to be "the classic Ramones album cover." The cover photo features (from left to right) Johnny Ramone, Tommy Ramone, Joey Ramone, and Dee Dee Ramone. Each stand against a brick wall and are in a straight line. Legs McNeil insists that "Tommy [is] standing on his [[Tippy toes|tip-toes]] and Joey [is] hunched over a bit."<ref name="Leigh 138"/> The cover was ranked number fifty-eight on [[Rolling Stone]]'s list of 100 Greatest Album Covers.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://rateyourmusic.com/lists/list_view?list_id=12793&show=50&start=50 |title = Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Album Covers |accessdate = 2010-05-23 |publisher = Rate Your Music}}</ref>

==Lyrical and musical themes==
"[[Blitzkrieg Bop]]," the album's opening track, was written by [[Tommy Ramone]]. Tommy originally named the track "Animal Hop",<ref>{{Harvnb|Leigh|2009|p=120}}</ref> but after [[Dee Dee Ramone]] reviewed the lyrics, they changed the lyrics as well as the name.<ref name="Leigh 121">{{Harvnb|Leigh|2009|p=121}}</ref> The song's original concept was "about kids going to a show and having a good time."<ref name="Leigh 121"/> After Dee Dee reviewed the song, he made the concept related to [[Nazism]].<ref name="Leigh 121"/> Spin Magazine said that the song "is like watching the atom split."<ref name="influential albums"/> "Beat on the Brat" was described by [[Dee Dee Ramone]] as a true story. "[[Joey Ramone|Joey]] saw some mother going after a kid with a bat in his lobby and wrote a song about it."<ref>{{Harvnb|McNeil and McCain|2009|p=183}}</ref> "Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue" was written about the adolescents of  [[Forest Hills, Queens|Forest Hills]], [[Queens]], who constantly sought cheap thrills to cure their boredom. The [[Ramones]] later recorded the similarly themed song "Carbona Not Glue" for their second album, ''[[Leave Home]]''. Dee Dee joked that after writing songs like "I Don't Wanna Go Down to the Basement", "I Don't Wanna Be Learned/I Don't Wanna Be Tamed", "I Don't Care", and "I Don't Wanna Walk Around with You", "We didn't write a positive song until 'Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue.'"<ref>{{Harvnb|McNeil and McCain|2009|p=212}}</ref> The song "53rd and 3rd" is about "Dee Dee turning tricks," said [[Johnny Ramone]].<ref name="Leigh 132">{{Harvnb|Leigh|2009|p=134}}</ref> Johnny said that the when writing the lyrics, they were "trying to be offensive."<ref>{{cite video | people      = Jim Fields (director) Michael Gramaglia (director) | date        = January 19, 2003 | title       = End of the Century: The Story of the Ramones | url         = http://www.endofthecentury.com/ | format      = DVD | medium      = Motion picture | language    = English | publisher   = [[Rhino Entertainment|Rhino Records]]/[[Sire Records]] | location    = United States | archiveurl  = http://www.webcitation.org/5qEvcAqd1 | archivedate =2010-06-04 13:27:54  | accessdate  =2010-06-04 | time        = 30:25 <U+2013> 20:45 | id          = AISN = B000642JG8 | isbn        = Unavailable | oclc        = Unavailable | quote       = "trying to be offensive" | ref         = ID}}</ref> The Ramones features the song "[[Let's Dance (Chris Montez song)|Let's Dance]]", which is a cover song originally performed by [[Chris Montez]].<ref name="Leigh 135"/>

==Reception==
''Ramones'' was well received by critics. Reviewing for [[Allmusic]], Stephen Thomas Erlewine awarded the album five out of five stars, saying the album "begins at a blinding speed and never once over the course of its 14 songs does it let up." Erlewine also noted that the album "is all about speed, hooks, stupidity, and simplicity."<ref name="allmusic"/> Douglas Wolk of [[Rolling Stone|Rolling Stone magazine]] gave the album five out of five stars as well, and noted the album "is one of the happiest albums ever made."<ref name="Rolling Stone"/> [[Robert Christgau]] gave the album an [[Grade (education)|A]], and said that he "loved" the album,<ref name="christgau"/> and [[About.com]] gave the album four and a half stars out of five.<ref name="about"/>

{{Quote box|width=400px|align=left|quote="When the [Ramones] hit the street in 1976 with their self-titled first album, the rock scene in general had become somewhat bloated and narcissistic. The Ramones got back to basics: simple, speedy, stripped-down rock and roll songs. Voice, guitar, bass, drums. No makeup, no egos, no light shows, no nonsense. And though the subject matter was sometimes dark, emanating from a sullen adolescent basement of the mind, the group also brought cartoonish fun and high-energy excitement back to rock and roll."|source =<U+2014>Rock and Roll Hall of Fame,<ref name="HallofFame"/>}}
Charles M. Young, an employee for the ''[[Rolling Stone|Rolling Stone Magazine]]'' praised the album, saying that the album is "one of the funniest rock records ever made and, if punk continues to gain momentum, a historic turning point."<ref name="many reviews">Craig Zeller and others [http://www.superseventies.com/spramones.html "Ramones"]. Superseventies. Retrieved 2010-06-04 </ref> Jeff Tamarkin of ''Allmusic'' said that "Punk rock begins here," referring to the album, and also proclaimed "rock's mainstream didn't know what hit it."<ref name="many reviews"/> In 1999, ''Collins Gem Classic Albums'' wrote that "They stared from the cover of this magnificent debut album with dumb defiance written all over them.<ref name="many reviews"/> The songs within were a short, sharp exercise in vicious speed-thrash, driven by ferocious guitars and yet halting in an instant. It was the simple pop dream taken to its minimalist extreme. There just couldn't be anything faster or harder than this. The Ramones was the starting gun for English punk."<ref name="many reviews"/> Joe S. Harrington declared that the album "split the history of rock 'n' roll in half."<ref name="many reviews"/> Theunis Bates, a music writer for ''[[Time magazine]]'' and an editor at worldpop.com, composed that "''Ramones'' stripped rock back to its basic elements," and noted that its "lyrics are very simple, boiled-down declarations of teen lust and need." Bates later went on to say that it "is the ultimate punk statement."<ref name="many reviews"/>

The album was included in Spin's ''List of Top Ten College Cult Classics'', noting that "everything good that's happened to music in the last fourteen years can be directly traced to the Ramones."<ref>{{cite book |title= Moshpit: The Violent World of Mosh Pit Culture |author1= Eric Weisband |author2= Craig Marks |year= 1995|publisher= Vintage|isbn= 0679755748}}</ref> The album was ranked thirty-three in Rolling Stone's "500 Greatest Albums of All Time."<ref>{{cite book |title= 500 Greatest Albums of All Time |last=Levy |first=Joe |year= 2005|publisher= Wenner|isbn= 1932958010}}</ref> The album debuted at number one-hundred eleven on the [[Billboard 200]].<ref name="charts">[http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:a9fqxqt5ldhe~T3 "allmusic ((( Ramones > Charts & Awards )))"].
