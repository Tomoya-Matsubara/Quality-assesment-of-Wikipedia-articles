'''''Hoplocypode occidentalis''''', commonly known as the '''gulf ghost crab''', is a [[species]] of [[Ocypodinae|ghost crab]]s native to the eastern [[Pacific ocean|Pacific]] coast of the [[Americas]], from the [[Gulf of California]] to [[Colombia]]. It is the [[monotypic|only species]] in the [[genus]] '''''Hoplocypode'''''.<ref name="sakai"/> Gulf ghost crabs are medium-sized ghost crabs reaching a maximum overall body diameter of {{convert|6|in|cm|abbr=on}}. They are one of only two ghost crab species found in the eastern Pacific (the other being the [[Ocypode gaudichaudii|painted ghost crab]]s). However, gulf ghost crabs can easily be distinguished from painted ghost crabs by the absence of "horns" on their eyes.<ref name="sakai">{{cite journal|author=Katsushi Sakai & Michael T<U+00FC>rkay|year=2013|title=Revision of the genus ''Ocypode'' with the description of a new genus, ''Hoplocypode'' (Crustacea: Decapoda: Brachyura)|journal=Memoirs of the Queensland Museum <U+2013> Nature|volume=56|issue=2|pages=665<U+2013>793|url=http://www.qm.qld.gov.au/~/media/Documents/QM/About%20Us/Publications/Memoirs%20-%20Nature/N56-2/qmn56-2-sakaiturkay.pdf}}</ref>

==Taxonomy==
''Hoplocypode occidentalis'' was first described by the American marine biologist [[William Stimpson]] in 1860 as ''Ocypoda occidentalis''.<ref name="stimp">{{cite journal|author=William Stimpson|year=1860|title=Notes on North American Crustacea. No. II|journal=Annals of the Lycaeum of Natural History of New-York |volume=7|pages=176&ndash;246}}</ref> The [[type specimen]]s were originally collected from [[Cabo San Lucas]], [[Baja California]], [[Mexico]]. It was transferred to its own genus ''Hoplocypode'' in 2013 by Katsushi Sakai and Michael T<U+00FC>rkay based on the differences of their [[gonopod]]s (leg pairs modified into copulatory organs) from that of the rest of the members of the genus ''[[Ocypode]]''. It is classified under the ghost crab [[subfamily (biology)|subfamily]] [[Ocypodinae]] in the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Ocypodidae]].<ref name="sakai"/>

The generic name ''Hoplocypode'' is derived from [[Ancient Greek]] [[wikt:hopl-|<U+1F41><U+03C0><U+03BB><U+03AE>]] (''hopl<U+0113>'', "hoof") and ''[[Ocypode]]'', referring to the hoof-shaped tip of the first gonopod of males.<ref name="sakai"/> The latter itself is derived from the Ancient Greek ''{{lang|el|ocy-}}'' ("swift" or "fast") and {{lang|el|[[:wikt:<U+03C0><U+03BF><U+03B4><U+03CC><U+03C2>|<U+03C0><U+03BF><U+03B4><U+03CC><U+03C2>]]}} (''{{lang|el|podos}}'', "foot"), in reference to the animal's speed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/species-bank/sbank-treatment.pl?id=77373 |work=SpeciesBank |title=''Ocypode cordimana'' (Family Ocypodidae) |publisher=[[Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts]] |accessdate=November 5, 2010 |author=Keith Davey}}</ref> The specific name is from [[Latin]] ''[[wikt:occidentalis|occidentalis]]'' ("western").<ref name="sakai"/> They are commonly known as the "gulf ghost crab" in [[English language|English]] and ''cangrejo de playa'' in [[Spanish language|Spanish]].<ref name="cbrat"/><ref name="mex"/>

The carapace is squarish in shape wider than it is long,<ref name="sakai"/> with a length of around {{convert|43|mm|in|abbr=on}} and a width of {{convert|50|mm|in|abbr=on}}.<ref name="rathbun"/> It is thickly covered with rough small bumps (tubercles). Their eyestalks are large and elongated but do not possess "horns" as in some other ghost crab species. The outer half of margins of the eye sockets curve distinctly inwards, with the outer edges (exorbital angles) triangular in shape with a sharp forward-facing pointed end.<ref name="sakai"/>

Like other ghost crabs, one of the claw appendages ([[cheliped]]s, the first [[pereiopod]] pair) of gulf ghost crabs is much bigger than the other. The palm of the larger cheliped is elongated with a serrated lower edge and covered with tubercles on the upper surface. It features [[stridulation|stridulatory]] (sound-producing) ridges on the inner surface of the palm, which is important for identifying different species within the subfamily Ocypodinae. In gulf ghost crabs, the stridulatory ridge is short and composed of a row of 21 to 22 tubercles. The smaller cheliped tapers towards a pointed end.<ref name="sakai"/>

The second pair of walking legs are not more than two and a half times the length of the carapace. The fourth pair is relatively smaller and weaker in comparison to the other three pairs, reaching only to the middle of the [[Arthropod leg#Crustacea|propodus]] of the third pair. The [[Arthropod leg#Crustacea|mera]] and [[Arthropod leg#Crustacea|carpi]] of all the legs are naked, but the propodi possess fur-like bristles (setae) on for the first three walking leg pairs varying by sex.<ref name="rathbun"/> In males, the propodi of the first and second pair of walking legs have their upper forward surfaces covered with setae. The propodi of the third pair of walking legs only have setae on the upper margin of the propodi. In females, the propodi of the third and last pair of walking legs do not possess bristles on the upper surfaces of their propodi.<ref name="sakai"/> 

The first gonopod (modified copulatory organs) of males are also distinctively complex in shape, with a triangular cross-section at the base and becoming hoof-like towards the end. This characteristic is one of the diagnostic criteria for the genus. The covering (operculum) of the genital duct of the females have four sides and are membranous and slightly calcified. The genital slit is narrow and aligned along the middle of the operculum.<ref name="sakai"/>

==Ecology==
Gulf ghost crabs live in burrows near the [[intertidal zone]] of open sandy beaches and on sand and silt banks near where river mouths empty into the sea. Larger individuals usually have burrows further up the shore while smaller individuals are closer to the waves.<ref name="cbrat">{{cite web|url=http://cbrat.nationalatlas.gov/species/101380/species_comments|title=''Ocypode occidentalis'' Stimpson, 1860  |author=CBRAT - Coastal Biogeographic Risk Analysis Tool|publisher=US Environmental Protection Agency |accessdate=November 7, 2013}}</ref><ref name="mex">{{cite web|url=http://www.mexfish.com/fish/ghcrab/ghcrab.htm|title=Gulf Ghost Crab|author=Gene Kira, Neil Kelly, & Ray Cannon|date=1998-2011|publisher=MexFish|accessdate=November 7, 2013}}</ref> They are [[nocturnal]], emerging from their burrows just after sunset.<ref name="mex"/> They are fast-moving [[generalist species|generalist]] [[scavenger]]s and [[predator]]s, usually feeding on decaying bodies of [[fish]] and other [[crustacea]]ns.<ref name="bright"/><ref name="cbrat"/> They are also devastating predators of eggs and hatchlings of sea turtles, including the olive ridley sea turtle (''[[Lepidochelys olivacea]]'') and the leatherback sea turtle (''[[Dermochelys coriacea]]'').<ref name="cbrat"/><ref name="dean">{{cite book|author=Fernando Enciso-Saracho, Marco A.

==Distribution==
Gulf ghost crabs are native to the eastern [[Pacific ocean|Pacific]] coast of the Americas, from the [[Gulf of California]] to [[Colombia]]. They are [[Sympatry|sympatric]] with the painted ghost crab (''[[Ocypode gaudichaudii]]''), and juvenile specimens of the two smaller than {{convert|5|by|6|mm|in|abbr=on}} are very difficult to tell apart. However the adults are readily distinguishable, as painted ghost crabs are brightly colored and possess "horns" on their eyestalks which are absent in gulf ghost crabs. Painted ghost crabs also prefer sheltered rocky beaches, while gulf coast crabs are found in open sandy beaches.<ref name="sakai"/><ref name="hedgpeth"/>

Gulf ghost crabs also superficially resemble the Atlantic ghost crab (''[[Ocypode quadrata]]''), but the two species do not occur in the same areas, with the latter being only found in the western [[Atlantic ocean|Atlantic]] coast of the Americas.<ref name="sakai"/>
