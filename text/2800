'''Yanni''' (later John) '''Alexis Mardas''' (born May 5, 1942, [[Athens, Greece]]) is better known as '''Magic Alex''', the name given him by [[The Beatles]] when he knew the group between 1965 and 1969, is a self-styled [[electronics]] wizard and one-time head of The Beatles' [[Apple Corps#Apple Electronics|Apple Electronics]]. 

Mardas arrived in England in 1965, exhibiting his ''Kinetic Light Sculptures'' at the [[Indica Gallery]]. Mardas impressed [[John Lennon]] with his ''Nothing Box''; a small plastic box with randomly blinking lights, and boasted that he could build a 72-track [[magnetic tape|tape]] machine, so was given the job of designing the new [[Apple Studio]] in [[Savile Row]]. Mardas failed to live up to his promises of new inventions, which also included electric paint, wallpaper loudspeakers, a flying saucer, and a "sonic force field". Mardas was involved in the hasty departure of Lennon and [[George Harrison]] from the [[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]]'s ashram in India, and Lennon's divorce of his first wife, [[Cynthia Lennon]]. 

In the 1970s, the anti-terrorism industry offered bullet-proof vehicles, bugging devices and security hardware, and Mardas set up various companies offering these products to royalty and VIPs. [[Hussein of Jordan|King Hussein of Jordan]] bought a fleet of cars that Mardas had customised, but the cars proved to be more life-threatening than ordinary vehicles, as bullets easily pierced the supposed armour-plating, and the glass splintered. In 1987, Mardas was a managing director of Alcom Ltd, which specialised in Electronic Communications and Security Systems. He now lives in Greece.

==London and The Beatles==
The 21-year-old Yanni Alexis Mardas first arrived in England on a student visa in 1965, befriending [[John Dunbar]] of the Indica Gallery in London, and later moving in with him in a flat on Bentinck Street, which was where Mardas first met Lennon. Shortening his name to Yanni Mardas, he found employment as a television repairman.<ref name="MilesManyYears373"> Miles, ''Many Years From Now'', 1997. p373</ref> Dunbar later introduced Mardas to [[Brian Jones]],<ref name="Spitzp704"/> after Mardas exhibited his ''Kinetic Light Sculptures'' at the Indica Gallery.<ref name="AcidArtWorkToAuction"/> Dunbar worked with Mardas on the <U+201C>psychedelic light box<U+201D> for [[The Rolling Stones]]' three-week tour of Europe in 1967,<ref name="TheLoveYouMakep205"> Brown, Peter and Gaines, Steven S., '' The Love You Make: An Insider's Story of the Beatles '', 1983. p205</ref> although they were not impressed with the results.<ref name="AcidArtWorkToAuction"/> Dunbar later said: "He was quite cunning in the way he pitched his thing.

Jones introduced Mardas to Lennon, and it was at this point that Mardas impressed Lennon with his ''Nothing Box''; a small plastic box with randomly blinking lights that Lennon would stare at for hours while under the influence of LSD.<ref name="TheBeatlesAnthologyDVD1"> The Beatles ''Anthology'' DVD (2003) (Episode 8 - 0:29:53) George Martin talking about the toys that Mardas gave Lennon.</ref> Lennon later introduced  the renamed John Alexis Mardas as his "new guru", calling him "Magic Alex".<ref name="Spitzp705"> Spitz, ''The Beatles'', 2005. p705</ref> Mardas told Lennon about his ideas for futuristic electronic devices he was "working on", such as a telephone that responded to its owner's voice and could identify who was calling,<ref name="MilesManyYears442443"> Miles (<U+2018><U+2019>Many Years From Now<U+2019><U+2019>) 1997. pp442-443</ref> a force field that would surround The Beatles' homes, an X-ray camera, paint that would make anything invisible, car paint that would change colour by flicking a switch, and wallpaper speakers,<ref name="TheLoveYouMakep206"> Brown, Peter and Gaines, Steven S., ''The Love You Make: An Insider's Story of the Beatles'', 1983. p206</ref> which would actually be a part of the wallpaper.<ref name="Spitzp705"/> Mardas later asked for the [[V-12]] engines from Lennon's [[Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls-Royce]] and Harrison's [[Ferrari]] Berlinetta car, so he could build a [[Flying saucer]].<ref name="Spitzp705"/> The Beatles set up a company for Mardas called Fiftyshapes Ltd., in September 1967,<ref name="EverettMusicians159"> Everett, ''The Beatles as musicians'', 1999. p159</ref> and Mardas later became one of the first employees of the newly formed [[Apple Corps]], earning <U+00A3>40 a week and receiving 10% of any profits made from his inventions.<ref name="Spitzp728"> Spitz, ''The Beatles'', 2005. p728</ref><ref name="Kingsand Queensofexcess">{{cite web |first= |last= |url= http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-390967/Meet-Kings-Queens-excess.html |title=Meet the Kings (and Queens) of excess |publisher=[[The Daily Mail]] |date=[[2006-06-16]] |accessdate=2008-07-30}}</ref> 
[[Image:Mardas In Apple Electronics.JPG|right|thumb|250px|Mardas in the Apple Electronics laboratory with some of the equipment he used]] 
The Beatles often called Mardas the "Greek wizard",<ref name="16MagazineSep1968p48"> [[16 Magazine]], September 1968. p48</ref> and [[Paul McCartney]] remembered being interested in his ideas: <U+201C>Well, if you [Mardas] could do that, we<U+2019>d like one."

Mardas was given his own laboratory called Apple Electronics, at 34 Boston Place, Westminster, London, and was helped to obtain a British work [[Visa (document)|visa]]. 
On The Beatles ''Anthology'' DVD, Mardas is shown wearing a white laboratory assistant's coat in Apple Electronics (with loud oscillating noises in the background) saying, "Hello, I<U+2019>m Alexis, from Apple Electronics. I would like to say <U+2018>Hello<U+2019> to all my brothers around the world, and to all the girls around the world, and to all the electronic people around the world. That is Apple Electronics." Mardas then turns and points back to a collection of two portable 2-track recorders in wooden boxes, a 2-track studio recording machine, voltage meters, a hi-fi amplifier, an oscilloscope and a TV screen showing pulsating psychedelic balloon shapes.<ref name="TheBeatlesAnthologyDVD2"> The Beatles ''Anthology'' DVD, 2003. (Episode 8 - 0:30:02) Mardas in the Apple Electronics studio.</ref> A mysterious fire at the laboratory prevented Mardas from presenting his inventions, but he later said: "I<U+2019>m a rock gardener, and now I<U+2019>m doing electronics. Maybe next year, I make films or poems. I have no formal training in any of these, but this is irrelevant."<ref name="MilesManyYears"> Miles, <U+2018><U+2019>Many Years From Now<U+2019><U+2019>, 1997. pp531-532</ref> 

===Greece===
The Beatles had tried in 1964 to buy the {{convert|14|acre|m2|sing=on}} Trinity Island, off the coast of the Greek island of Euboea (resembling a guitar in shape) but the owners were not interested in a sale.<ref name="CountryLifeMagazine">{{cite web |first= |last= |url=http://www.countrylife.co.uk/property/guidesinternational/article/149163/Greek_islands_for_sale.html |title=Greek islands for sale |publisher=[[Country Life]] (magazine)  |accessdate=2008-07-31}}</ref> Lennon was still interested in The Beatles buying or leasing an island to live on together, and discussed it with the other Beatles on 19 July 1967.<ref name="MilesBadmanDiaryp272"> Miles, Badman, ''The Beatles Diary: After the Break-Up; 1970-2001'', 2001. p272</ref> Mardas' father was a major in the Greek secret police, and Mardas explained that through him The Beatles would have access to Greek government connections, which would speed the acquisition of an island,<ref name="CampbellNewStatesman3August1979"/> as many islands did have the right certificates of ownership and were subject to government restrictions.<ref name="CountryLifeMagazine"/> On 22 July 1967, Harrison and his wife, [[Pattie Boyd]], [[Ringo Starr]] and [[Neil Aspinall]] flew to Athens, where they stayed in Mardas' parents' house overnight until Lennon, his wife and son,  McCartney and [[Jane Asher]], [[Pattie Boyd]]'s 16-year-old sister, Paula, [[Mal Evans]] and [[Alistair Taylor]] set off for Athens.<ref name="Spitzp704"> Spitz, ''The Beatles'', 2005. p704</ref> 

Their chartered yacht, the MV ''Arvi'', was detained in Crete because of bad weather, so the party had to wait in Athens for three days.<ref name="MilesBadmanDiaryp272"/> Taylor complained that on a trip to a small hill village, "We came round a corner of the peaceful road only to find hundreds of photographers clicking away at us", which Mardas had organised. McCartney later said that whilst sailing around Greek islands, everybody just sat around and took LSD.<ref name="MilesPage379"> Miles, ''Many Years From Now'', 1997. p379</ref><ref name="MilesPage380"> Miles, ''Many Years From Now'', 1997. p380</ref><ref name="TheBeatlesAnthologyDVD3"> The Beatles ''Anthology'' DVD 2003 (Episode 6 - 1:06:18) Harrison talking about the trip to Greece to buy an island.</ref> They eventually found the {{convert|80|acre|m2|sing=on}} island of Leslo, which had a small fishing village, four beaches and a large olive grove. Four small neighbouring islands surrounded it (which were planned as one for each Beatle) so the island was bought for <U+00A3>95,000 (with a 25% premium) but was sold for a modest profit a few months later, after all four Beatles lost interest in the idea.<ref name="Spitzp705"/>

===Apple Boutique and marriage===
On 1 August 1967, Mardas, Aspinall and [[Derek Taylor]], were invited by Harrison to stay at the home of Robert Fitzpatrick, on [[Blue Jay Way]], and on 7 August 1967, Harrison and his wife visited San Francisco's Haight-Ashbury district with Mardas.<ref name="TheBeatlesAnthologyDVD4"> The Beatles ''Anthology'' DVD, 2003. (Episode 7 - 0:06:42) Harrison talking about visiting Haight-Ashbury, with photos of Mardas sitting/standing next to him.</ref> The [[Apple Boutique]], at 94 [[Baker Street]], [[London]], was one of the first business ventures made by [[The Beatles]]' fledgling [[Apple Corps]], and Mardas (at great expense) was commissioned to create one of his ideas; an "artificial sun" which would light up the night-time sky,<ref name="ShottonSchaffnerp150"> Shotton and Schaffner, ''John Lennon: In My Life'' (1983) p150</ref> for the opening on [[7 December]] [[1967]].<ref name="Spitzp730"> Spitz, ''The Beatles'', 2005. p730</ref> When the time came for Mardas to produce his artificial sun,<ref name="HarryBeatlesEncyclopediap717"> Harry, ''The Beatles Encyclopedia'', 2000. p717</ref> he claimed that there was not a strong enough energy supply to power it, which was accepted by The Beatles.<ref name="Spitzp732"> Spitz, ''The Beatles'', 2005. p732</ref> Mardas appeared (uncredited) in the Beatles' TV movie ''[[Magical Mystery Tour (film)|Magical Mystery Tour]]'',<ref name="EverettMusicians159"/> which was first broadcast on [[BBC1]] on [[Boxing Day]] in 1967. On 11 July 1968, 26-year-old Mardas married 22-year-old Eufrosyne Doxiades (the daughter of a respected Greek architect) at [[Saint Sophia (London)|St Sophia's Church]], London.<ref name="16MagazineNov1968p64"> [[16 Magazine]], November 1968. p64</ref> Harrison and his wife attended, and Lennon (who was there with [[Yoko Ono]]) was joint best man, along with [[Donovan]].<ref name="16MagazineNov1968p64"/>

===Maharishi Mahesh Yogi and India===
[[File:MaharishiMaheshYogi-04.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]]
Mardas and Aspinall joined Lennon and Harrison in India, where they were studying meditation under the tutelage of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, although Starr had flown back to England<U+2014>complaining the Indian food did not agree with him<U+2014>and McCartney had left on 24 March 1968.<ref name="Spitzp755"> Spitz, ''The Beatles'', 2005. p755</ref> When Mardas first met the Maharishi, he said sarcastically, "I know you! Didn<U+2019>t I meet you in Greece years ago?"<ref name="BadmanBaconBeachBoysp214"> Miles, Bacon, ''The Beach Boys'', 2004. p214</ref> Mardas was jealous about the control the Maharishi had over Lennon, and during one of their frequent walks through the woods he asked Lennon why the Maharishi always had an accountant by his side.<ref name="MaharishiMaheshYogiSpiritualLeaderTheIndependent">{{cite web |first= |last= |url= http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/maharishi-mahesh-yogi-spiritual-leader-who-introduced-millions-including-the-beatles-to-transcendental-meditation-779109.html |title=Maharishi Mahesh Yogi: Spiritual leader who introduced millions, including the Beatles, to transcendental meditation |publisher=[[The Independent]] |date=[[2008-02-07]] |accessdate=2008-08-08}}</ref> Lennon replied that The Beatles (or Lennon and Harrison) were considering donating a large part of their income to the Maharishi's bank accounts in Switzerland.<ref name="Spitzp755-756"> Spitz, ''The Beatles'', 2005. pp755-756</ref> When Mardas questioned the Maharishi about this, he offered money to Mardas to build a high-powered radio station, so he could broadcast his teachings to the whole of India.<ref name="TheLoveYouMakep261"> Brown, Peter and Gaines, Steven S., ''The Love You Make: An Insider's Story of the Beatles'', 1983. p261</ref>  

Alcohol was not allowed in the Maharishi's [[ashram]], but Mardas smuggled some in from Dehra Dun,<ref name="Spitzp755"/> and later reported to Lennon and Harrison that the Maharishi had had sex with a young American student,<ref name="TheBeatlestheMaharishiandme">{{cite web|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/article3340963.ece |date=10 February 2008|title=The Beatles, the Maharishi and me |first= Cynthia|last=Lennon |work=[[The Sunday Times]]|publisher=Times Newspapers  |accessdate=2009-07-10}}</ref> and had made a sexual advance toward [[Mia Farrow]].<ref name="Spitzp756"> Spitz, ''The Beatles'', 2005. p756</ref> This was not fully supported in Farrow's autobiography, ''What Falls Away'' (1997) writing that she may have misinterpreted the supposed sexual advance.<ref name="Spitzp756"/> Mardas continued to insist the Maharishi was not what he said he was; even making Harrison unsure. Lennon thought at the time: "Well, it must be true, because if George [Harrison] is doubting him, there must be something in it."<ref name="Spitzp756"/> Lennon and Harrison confronted the Maharishi, but the startled Maharishi's answers didn't satisfy them, and they decided to leave the camp.<ref name="Spitzp756"/> Mardas insisted that they (Lennon, Harrison and their respective wives) must leave the camp at once, or the Maharishi might send down some "black magic" on them. Mardas then went down to [[Dehra Dun]] to organise taxis for the next morning to take them all to [[Delhi]].<ref name="Spitzp756"/>  

Cynthia Lennon personally believed that Mardas invented the story about sexual impropriety to undermine the Maharishi's influence on The Beatles, as Mardas was always jealous of anyone having Lennon's attention.<ref name="BrownTheLoveYouMakep264"> Brown, Gaines, ''The Love You Make'', 1995 reprint. p264</ref><ref> Miles, ''Many Years from Now'', 1997. p429.

===Lennon's divorce===
After returning to England in May 1968, Lennon suggested that Cynthia take a holiday in Greece with Mardas, [[Donovan]], Boyd, and her sister.<ref name="Uncutmagazine"> Hunt, Chris ([[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]]) December 2005</ref> Lennon said that he would be very busy recording ''[[The Beatles (album)|The White Album]]'' and that it would do her some good to take a break with Mardas, his girlfriend [[Jenny Boyd]], and others.<ref name=" CynthiaJohnp281-282"> Cynthia Lennon, ''John'', 2006. pp281-282</ref> Cynthia arrived home one day early from Greece on 22 May 1968. She and Mardas discovered Lennon and Ono sitting cross-legged on the floor, staring into each others eyes, and found Ono's slippers outside the Lennon's marital bedroom door.<ref name="Spitzp772"> Spitz, ''The Beatles'', 2005. p772</ref> Cynthia asked Boyd and Mardas if she could spend the night at their apartment. At the apartment Boyd went straight to bed, but Mardas got Cynthia drunk and tried to convince her that they should both run away together. After Cynthia had been sick in the bathroom she collapsed on a bed in the spare bedroom, but Mardas joined her and tried to kiss her until she (in her words) "pushed him away".<ref name=" CynthiaJohnp288-289"> Cynthia Lennon ''John'', 2006. pp288-289</ref> [[Brian Epstein]]'s personal assistant, [[Peter Brown (music industry)|Peter Brown]], maintains that Cynthia did sleep with Mardas, saying: "She knew it was a mistake the moment it happened, especially with Alex [Mardas], whom she had never trusted, nor even liked."<ref name="Spitzp772"/>

Lennon went to New York with McCartney shortly after and told Cynthia she could not go with them, so Cynthia went on a trip to Italy with her mother.<ref name=" CynthiaJohnp292-293"> Cynthia Lennon, ''John'', 2006. pp292-293</ref> During Cynthia's holiday in Italy, an "agitated" Mardas unexpectedly arrived (pacing up and down outside Cynthia's hotel until she returned)<ref name="Spitzp773"> Spitz, ''The Beatles'', 2005. p773</ref> giving the news that Lennon was planning to sue Cynthia for [[divorce]] on grounds of [[adultery]], seek sole custody of Julian, and send Cynthia "back to Hoylake".<ref name="Colemanp464"> Coleman, ''Lennon: The Definitive Biography'', 1992. p464</ref> Mardas also said that he intended to testify in court that Cynthia had committed adultery with him. She said in 2005: "The mere fact that Magic Alex [Mardas] arrived in Italy in the middle of the night without any prior knowledge of where I was staying made me extremely suspicious. I was being coerced into making it easy for John [Lennon] and Yoko to accuse me of doing something that would make them not look so bad."<ref>''The Loves Of John Lennon'' by [[Chris Hunt]], [[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]], John Lennon Special, 2005.</ref>

===Apple Studio===
[[Image:3 Savile Row.jpg|thumb|left|150px|3 Savile Row; The Beatles' Apple offices, where Mardas was supposed to build a studio in the basement]] 
Mardas often said that the [[Abbey Road Studios|Abbey Road]] studio was "no good",<ref name="TheBeatlesAnthologyDVD5"> The Beatles ''Anthology'' DVD, 2003. (Episode 8 - 0:29:56) George Martin talking about Mardas saying that Abbey Road was <U+201C>No good<U+201D>.</ref> much to producer [[George Martin]]'s annoyance: "The trouble was that Alex was always coming to the studios to see what we were doing and to learn from it, while at the same time saying <U+2018>These people are so out of date.<U+2019> But I found it very difficult to chuck him out, because the boys liked him so much. Since it was very obvious that I didn<U+2019>t, a minor schism developed."<ref name="AllYouNeedIsEars"> Martin, ''All You Need Is Ears'', 1994. p173</ref> Mardas boasted that he could build a much better studio, with a 72-track [[magnetic tape|tape]] machine,<ref name="TheBeatlesRecordingSessionsp164"> Lewisohn, ''The Beatles Recording Sessions'', 1990. p164</ref> instead of the 4-track at Abbey Road<U+2014>which was being updated at the time to an 8-track<U+2014>so he was given the job of designing the new Apple Studio in the basement of Apple headquarters in Savile Row.<ref name="Spitzp768"> Spitz, ''The Beatles'', 2005. p768</ref> One of Mardas' more outrageous plans was to replace the [[sound baffle|acoustic baffles]] (sound insulators, used to prevent [[Leakage#Sound_recording|leakage]]) around Starr's drums with an [[Standing_waves#Opposing_waves|invisible sonic force field]].<ref name="Spitzp810"/> Starr remembered that Mardas bought some "huge" computers from British Aerospace, which were stored in his barn, but "they never left the barn", and were later sold as scrap metal.<ref name="Spitzp810"/>  

Mardas gave the Beatles regular reports of his progress, but when they required their new studio in January 1969, during the ''[[Get Back]]'' project that became ''[[Let It Be (album)|Let It Be]]'', they discovered an unusable studio: no 72-track tape deck (Mardas had reduced it to 16 tracks)<ref name="Spitzp810"/> no [[soundproofing]], no [[talkback (recording)|talkback]] ([[intercom]]) system, and not even a [[patch bay]] to run the wiring between the control room and the 16 speakers that Mardas had fixed haphazardly to the walls.<ref name="Spitzp810"/> The only new piece of sound equipment present was a crude [[mixing board|mixing console]] which Mardas had built, which looked (in the words of Martin's assistant, Dave Harries) like "bits of wood and an old oscilloscope".<ref name="Spitzp810"/> The console was scrapped after just one session. Harrison said it was "chaos", and that they had to "rip it all out and start again,"<ref name="TheBeatlesAnthologyDVD6"> The Beatles ''Anthology'' DVD, 2003. (Episode 8 - 0:30:32) Harrison talking about the chaos in the studio, and having to rip it all out.</ref> calling it, "the biggest disaster of all time."<ref name="Spitzp810"> Spitz, ''The Beatles'', 2005. p810</ref> Harrison's suspicions of Mardas' competence had been raised when he saw him wandering around in a white coat with a clipboard, and considered the possibility that Mardas had "just read the latest version of ''Science Weekly'', and used its ideas."<ref name="TheBeatlesAnthologyBookp290"> The Beatles ''Anthology'' Book, 2000. p290</ref>

The Beatles asked producer Martin to come to the rescue, so he borrowed two four-track recorders from [[EMI]], and long-time Beatles' engineer, [[Geoff Emerick]], was given the task of building and setting up a studio with portable equipment.<ref name="Spitzp811"> Spitz, ''The Beatles'', 2005. p811</ref> After [[Allen Klein]] was brought in to be The Beatles' manager in 1969, he closed Apple Electronics,<ref name="GetBackandothersetbacks">{{cite web |first=John |last=Robinson |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2003/nov/22/popandrock.thebeatles |title=Get Back and other setbacks |publisher=[[The Guardian]] |date=[[2003-11-02]] |accessdate=2008-08-08}}</ref> and Mardas left the company.<ref name="IndependentApology"/><ref name="Milesp546"> Miles, ''Many Years from Now'', 1997. p546</ref> It was later estimated that Mardas' ideas and projects had cost The Beatles at least <U+00A3>300,000 (3 million British pounds today).<ref name="CampbellNewStatesman3August1979"/><ref name="MeasuringWorth">{{cite web |first= |last= |url=http://www.measuringworth.com/ppoweruk/ |title=Purchasing Power of British Pounds from 1264 to 2007 |publisher=Measuring Worth |accessdate=2008-08-08}}</ref> Starr once approved of one of Mardas<U+2019> ideas that is relevant today: "He [Mardas] had an idea to stop people taping our records off the radio <U+2013> you<U+2019>d have to have a decoder to get the signal, and then we thought we could sell the time and put commercials on instead.

==Security consultant==
In the 1970s, the anti-terrorism industry offered bullet-proof vehicles, bugging devices and security hardware. Mardas set up various companies offering these products to royalty and VIPs, using the former King of Greece as his principal salesman.<ref name="CampbellNewStatesman3August1979"> Campbell, Duncan, [[New Statesman]], 3 August 1979. pp158-160</ref> Ex-King [[Constantine II of Greece]] (then exiled in Britain) provided contacts to a half a dozen royal families for Mardas, and had close contact with the deposed [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi|Shah of Iran]], who had moved to Mexico. The Shah was one of the first customers for the customised bullet-proof cars that Mardas was offering, and was believed to have financially assisted Mardas<U+2019> companies.<ref name="CampbellNewStatesman3August1979"/>  

In 1974, Mardas held an expensive party for the then Spanish heir, [[Juan Carlos I of Spain|Prince Juan Carlos]], which secured Mardas a contract. After the assassination of [[Luis Carrero Blanco|Admiral Carrero Blanco]] the Spanish royal family thought it should acquire more bullet-proof cars, although one car was shipped to England, where it was parked in [[Chobham]] for almost a year as nobody knew how to do the work needed to upgrade it. The second contract (worth over <U+00A3>1/2 million) allowed Mardas to set up new security companies: Alcom Devices Ltd, and Night Vision Systems Ltd (under the collective name of "Project Alcom") in St Albans Mews off [[Edgware Road, London]]. They were founded to provide a sophisticated communications system for Juan Carlos, so he could be in constant contact with his security services.<ref name="CampbellNewStatesman3August1979"/>

[[Qaboos of Oman|The Sultan of Oman]] ordered six [[Mercedes-Benz 450SEL 6.9|Mercedes 450]] limousines in 1977, but quickly discovered that they were not as safe as he had been led to believe. His ex-[[Special Air Service|SAS]] bodyguards tested one of the cars in the desert in July 1977, by firing at them, but a bullet hit an emergency air cylinder, which led to the petrol tank blowing up, burning the whole car.<ref name="CampbellNewStatesman3August1979"/> The remaining cars were immediately sent back, with a demand to refund the money spent.<ref name="CampbellNewStatesman3August1979"/>  
King Hussein of Jordan had a fleet of cars that Mardas customised, but carried out a safety test on them with live ammunition in November 1977. One eyewitness reported that the cars could be more life-threatening than ordinary vehicles, as bullets easily pierced the armour-plating, and the thick armoured glass broke into jagged splinters when broken. Hussein ordered that the cars be reverted to their previous state.<ref name="CampbellNewStatesman3August1979"/> These failures convinced Mardas and Constantine to look at the growing European market for anti-terrorist protection, setting up a factory in London to produce <U+201C>bullet-proof<U+201D> cars in 1978. This was financed by an investment of over <U+00A3>1 million through anonymous Monaco and Swiss bank accounts, which were believed to be controlled by the Shah.<ref name="CampbellNewStatesman3August1979"/>

In 1987, Mardas was a managing director of Alcom Ltd, at Abbey House, 299A Edgware Road, London. The company specialised in Electronic Communications and Security Systems, but never dealt directly with the public; preferring to work with Government Authorities. Mardas employed Arthur Johnson (known as Johnny Johnson), a former [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|M.O.D.]] official.<ref name="CampbellNewStatesman3August1979"/>

Mardas put 15 items from his collection of Lennon memorabilia up for sale on 5 May 2004, at [[Christie's]] in South Kensington, London. Among the sale was Lennon<U+2019>s leather collar,<ref name="Lot251">{{cite web |first= |last= |url=http://www.invaluable.com/auction-lot/john-lennon-1-c-4g22cnup0t  |title=Lot 251 : John Lennon  |publisher=Invaluable  |accessdate=2008-12-22}}</ref> worn during 1967 and 1968 (at the launch party for the ''[[Sgt.

[[The Independent]] newspaper apologised on 21 August 2006, writing that on 14 June 2006, the paper had wrongly reported Mardas' involvement with Apple Electronics Ltd. They corrected the earlier piece by writing that Mardas had not been a company employee, but a director and shareholder of Apple Electronics, and was not sacked, but resigned his directorship in May 1971, while still retaining his shareholding, until giving it to Apple Corps some years later. The paper accepted that Mardas <U+201C>did not claim to have invented electric paint, a flying saucer or a recording studio with a <U+2018>sonic force field<U+2019> or cause his employers to waste money on such ideas. We apologise to Mr. Mardas for these errors."<ref name="IndependentApology">{{cite web |first= |last= |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/john-alexis-mardas-412809.html |title=John Alexis Mardas |publisher=[[The Independent]] |date=[[2006-08-21]] |accessdate=2008-07-30}}</ref> In 2008, Mardas won the right to sue the New York Times about an online article which said he was a [[charlatan]].
