==Biography==
Jeanne Betancourt was born and raised in [[Burlington, Vermont]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://biography.jrank.org/pages/13/Betancourt-Jeanne-1941-Personal.html |title=Jeanne Betancourt (1941-) - Personal |publisher=Biography.jrank.org |date= |accessdate=2010-04-30}}</ref> She lived across from a [[dairy farm]] and spent much of her time, as she put it, " <U+201C>helping<U+201D> in the barns and hanging out in the big farm kitchen with our Swedish neighbors".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jbetancourt.typepad.com/jbetancourt/2005/10/about_jeanne_be.html |title=Jeanne Betancourt |publisher=Jbetancourt.typepad.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-30}}</ref> During her childhood, she never considered being an author. She studied tap-dancing and wanted to dance when she grew up. Then she moved to New York, where she finished school, began teaching, and earned a degree in film from [[New York University]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.scholastic.com/browse/contributor.jsp?id=1917 |title=Jeanne Betancourt |publisher=Scholastic.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-30}}</ref> After a few years of teaching junior high and high school, she wrote her first novel and soon became a full time author.

She currently lives either on the top floor of a sixteen-story building near the [[American Museum of Natural History]] in [[New York City]] or in her home in Connecticut. In her free time she draws, paints, and reads. She still loves to dance.

Betancourt has written numerous scripts for television, garnering [[the National Psychological Award for Excellence in the Media]], two [[Humanities citation]]s, and six [[Emmy Award]] nominations.
