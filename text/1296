He spent one year at [[Boundary Park]], making just six league appearances for ''the Latics'', before joining [[Bury F.C.|Bury]] in 1972.

He was a guest of his friend, then-[[Raith Rovers F.C.|Raith Rovers]] manager and former [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]] teammate [[Jimmy Nicholl]], for the 16 April league match between the two clubs.]]
In 1976, Spence joined [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] side [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]], and made his debut for the Seasiders against [[Brian Clough]]'s [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] on 16 October. He complemented the twin striking powers of [[Mickey Walsh]] and fellow new signing [[Bob Hatton]]. However, at the end of [[Blackpool F.C. season 1976<U+2013>77|the season]] he found his place under threat from [[Stan McEwan]].

A serious injury kept Spence out of the entire [[Blackpool F.C. season 1977-78|1977-78]] campaign, which ended with Blackpool's relegation to the [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] for the first time in their history. 

Spence then joined [[Greece|Greek]] [[Super League Greece|Alpha Ethniki]] club [[Olympiacos CFP|Olympiacos]], where he made 21 league appearances, scoring six goals. He then returned to Blackpool then playing in the Third Division, and joined forces with [[Tony Kellow]], who had signed from [[Exeter City F.C.|Exeter City]]. Between them, they scored 27 goals in the [[Blackpool F.C. season 1978<U+2013>79|1978<U+2013>79 season]], nearly half of the team's total, with Spence top scorer on sixteen goals.

On 26 December 1979, in a game against [[Hull City F.C.|Hull City]] at [[Bloomfield Road]], Spence suffered an injury serious enough that it eventually forced his premature retirement from the game. In 1980, he moved to Fourth Division side [[Southend United F.C.|Southend United]], helping them to win promotion in the [[1980<U+2013>81 in English football|1980<U+2013>81 season]] as champions. He scored 32 goals in 104 games over a two-year period.

Between 1982 and 1986, Spence spent spells with [[Netherlands|Dutch]] club [[Sparta Rotterdam]] and [[Hong Kong]] clubs [[Sea Bee F.C.|Sea Bee]] and [[Hong Kong Rangers FC|Hong Kong Rangers]] before finishing his professional career with a second spell at Bury in 1986.<ref name="bury1230612"/> He retired in 1986 at the age of 34 and eventually hung up his boots in [[Non-League football]] with [[Oldham Boro F.C.|Oldham Town]] in the [[North West Counties Football League]].

==International career==
Spence won his first [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]] cap on 16 March 1975, in a single-goal victory over [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]] in Belfast. He went on to win 29 caps in total, scoring three goals. His most notable appearance occurred on 13 October 1976, when he came on as a late substitute and scored a late equaliser against the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] in a [[1978 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)#Group 4|World Cup qualifying game]] in [[Rotterdam]].<ref name=""ifa2295>{{cite news | last = Gillespie| first = Marshall| title = Goalscoring Substitutes| publisher = [[Irish Football Association]]| date = 6 July 2006| url = http://www.irishfa.com/the-ifa/news/2295/goalscoring-substitutes/| accessdate = 15 September 2008}}</ref>

He ended his international career after discovering, via [[Teletext]], that [[Billy Bingham]] had left him out of the [[1982 FIFA World Cup|1982 World Cup]] squad.{{Fact|date=November 2009}}
