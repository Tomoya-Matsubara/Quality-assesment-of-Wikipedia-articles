Known for her power, she developed her strength racing the boys and older amateurs, including men up to the present time. She won her first professional race in the Girls Pro at the [[American Bicycle Association]] (ABA) Winternationals in [[Phoenix, Arizona]] on [[April 1]], [[2006]]. She also won the next day.<ref>''BMX Plus!'' July 2006 Vol.29 No.7 pg.69 (results)</ref> In 2006 she became British National No.1 in 19 & Over Elite Men after racing the National series with the men all year. This was despite her being only 17 at the time and only 1.72 metres tall and weighing 76 kilograms. Her BMX victories at junior level include three World, eight European and five British BMX championships. Reade is also a champion track racer, riding on [[Velodrome]]s. In July 2007 she became the Women's Senior [[UCI BMX World Championships|UCI BMX World Champion]] and at the [[2007 UCI Track World Championships]],<ref>{{cite news |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/sportsNews/idUKL0239605320070403 |title=British track team set the gold standard |first=Simon |last=Baskett |publisher=Reuters |date=2007-04-03 |accessdate=2007-04-03}}</ref> she won the gold in the women's [[team sprint]] with [[Victoria Pendleton]].

This success in Velodrome racing follows the example of the former professional BMX racer, [[Jamie Staff]], who had a successful career both in Velodrome track racing and BMX racing. At the [[2008 UCI Track Cycling World Championships]] in [[Manchester Velodrome|Manchester]], she again won the gold in the women's team sprint with Pendleton. Reade was named one of the "Magnificent 7" by the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' in 2005,<ref name="toughonthetrack" /> and on [[November 20]], 2007 Reade was named ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' Young Sportswoman of the Year.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/more_sport/article2910170.ece |title=MCC Young Sportswoman of the Year.|publisher=Times Online |first=Rob |last=Maul |date=[[2007-11-20]] |accessdate=2007-12-13}}</ref>
Reade was named a member of the United Kingdom Olympic Team on [[July 9]], [[2008]] to represent Great Britain at BMX Racing's debut at the [[2008 Summer Olympic Games]] in [[Bejing, China]] with her teammate Liam Phillips competing in the men's division.

==BMX career==

Reade began racing in 1998 at the age of 10, at Tipkinder Park in [[Crewe]]. A local track operator named Bob Field, whose son also raced at the time, became her mentor.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/more_sport/article3602522.ece| publisher=timesonline.co.uk| title=Shanaze Reade, pedalling to Beijing| author=Andrew Longmore | date=March 23, 2008}}</ref> She was influenced by BMX professional racer, Jamie Staff, who was also from Crewe and raced at Reade's home track before Reade's career<ref name="toughonthetrack">{{cite web| url=http://www.mailonsunday.co.uk/pages/live/articles/sport/othersports.html?in_article_id=541989&in_page_id=1781| publisher=[[Mail on Sunday]]| title=Tough on the track... and off it, Shanaze is golden hope at BMX| author=Neil Wilson| date= March 2, 2008}}</ref> and during its early stages. She bought her first race bmx for [[pound sterling|<U+00A3>]]1.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.btplc.com/BTLondon2012/Ambassadorsprogramme/ShanazeReade/ShanazeReade.htm| publisher=BT Group| title=BT London 2012 > Our ambassadors > Shanaze Reade}}</ref> and fell in love with the sport ever since. She was previously a [[Track & Field]] enthusiast but apparently got bored with 100&nbsp;m sprint running and the [[Shot Put]] after five years in those sports before discovering BMX.<ref name="WHEELdeal" /><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.touchonlineuk.com/news/139/ARTICLE/1176/2008-02-13.html| publisher=Touch| title=Two Wheels Good<U+2026>Shanaze Reade PREVIEW| author=Roger Ajogbe| date=February 13, 2002}}</ref>

She raced the National series with the men all year and did so despite being only 17 years old at the time.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/sport/2006/12/30/brightest_hopes_primed_to_make.html| publisher=The Guardian Online, Sport Blog| title=Brightest hopes primed to make a big noise in 2007| date=December 30, 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.britishcycling.org.uk/nmsruntime/saveasdialog.asp?lID=3664&sID=3576| publisher=British Cycling| title=BC BMX National Series Rnd 6 - Event Report| 14 August 2006}}</ref> She commented on racing the males in a 2005 ''Decent World'' interview:

{{quote|'''SF:''' ''You've been racing against the boys in the Nationals, do some of them have a bit of a problem when you're beating them?''<br />'''Shanaze Reade:''' ''I am usually always top 3 when racing the guys. I have been racing them now for 2 years and I was almost the National Champion last year though had to settle for the No 2 spot. The boys in BMX are all cool, some spit their dummies out but I just let them get on with it! It's really quite fun to watch when I kick their booties..''<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.descent-world.co.uk/ARCHIVE_PRE2005/html/interview/ShanazeReade.htm| publisher=Descent World| title=Iterview: Shanaze Reade| author=Si Paton| date=Pre 2005 archive}}</ref>}}

Reade was named the sole women's member to the United Kingdom BMX Olympic team by [[British Cycling]] on [[July 9]], [[2008]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.cyclingnews.com/road/2008/olympics08/news.php?id=/news/2008/jul08/jul09news3oly| publisher=cyclingnews.com| title=Great Britain names strong Olympic squad| date=July 9, 2008}}</ref> Phillips was named to the team by the [[British Olympic Association]] as the sole male on the team on July 18, 2008 ahead of [[Kelvin Batey]]. In the Time and Team Trials held in [[Aigle, Switzerland]] on July 7, 2008, Bately suffered a concussion in a crash in the second moto of the Team Trial and the Trial was halted. Phillips was leading the trial with his eight to Bately's four at the time and was awarded the spot. The other two racers were further back in points but protested the decision. British Cycling had previously said that if anything cut short the time trial they will declare the winner anyone who had the most points at the time<ref>{{cite web| url=http://archive.somersetcountygazette.co.uk/2008/7/8/153885.html| publisher=somersetcountygazette.co.uk| title=Liam leads the way in Beijing BMX trial| date=July 8, 2008}}</ref> However, to settle the matter a secret time trial was held again in Switzerland on July 14, 2008 and Liam Phillips won all four runnings of the Team Trials, securing his place on the team.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.fatbmx.com/modules/news/article.php?storyid=5150| publisher=fatbmx.com| title=''Crupi<U+2019>s Liam Phillips earns a trip to the Olympics!| date=July 22, 2008}}</ref>

===Significant injuries===
Shanaze Reade fractured her knee two weeks before the UCI World Championships in July 2005 at a national in England. She raced the World Championships with her knee wrapped up and on pain killers but crashed in the quarter finals.<ref name="mysport">{{cite web| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?xml=/sport/2008/03/25/somysp125.xml| publisher=Telegraph| title=My Sport: Shanaze Reade| author=Gareth A Davies| date=March 25, 2008}}</ref>

Reade broke a [[metatarsal]] bone in June 2006 when she apparently slipped a pedal in practice. Her first race back was the 2006 European Championships where she only competed in the last two race event before the final Event. The cast came off four days before the European Championships Final Event.<ref name="trailblazer" /><ref name="trailblazer">{{cite web| url=http://women.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/women/body_and_soul/article2152270.ece| publisher=times.online.co.uk| title=Wheel trail blazer| author=Laura Deeley| date=July 28, 2007}}</ref>

{{quote|''Pain, though, is nothing new, even at Reade's age. Injuries are common in this aggressive form of cycling. This is not the first time she has broken her foot and other crashes have broken an elbow and a bone at the base of her spine.''<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/sport/othersports.html?in_article_id=395661&in_page_id=1781| publisher=dailymail.co.uk| title=Reade riding high in hunt for BMX gold| date=July 14, 2006}}</ref>}}

She won the World Championships in Brazil in August 2006 despite injuring a bone in her foot only three weeks before the competition.

She has also broken bones in her elbow and lower spine.<ref name="trailblazer" />

Reade started track racing on [[24 February]] [[2007]], her first ever competition on the [[velodrome]] was in the [[Manchester, England|Manchester]] round of the [[2006<U+2013>2007 UCI Track Cycling World Cup Classics]]. She took second place with [[Anna Blyth]] in the Team Sprint in a time of 34.294 seconds. The Gold Medal winning Dutch team of [[Yvonne Hijgenaar]] and [[Willy Kanis]]' time was 33.966 seconds. Like Reade, Kanis is also a champion BMX racer. Reade and Blyth's qualifying time was the fastest of the event at 33.802 seconds. In the final round, the Dutch team made a false start, however, Reade didn't notice the call back to the start and completed a lap at full sprint. In an post race interview, Reade said:

{{quote|''"...The first run in the final (the false start) definitely took a lot out of me because I got halfway down the back straight the second time and my legs were burning bad. I could never have dreamed I'd come away with a Silver medal in my first World Cup though."''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britishcycling.org.uk/web/site/BC/tra/EventReports2007/20070224_MWTC_Day_2_eve.asp| publisher=British Cycling| title=Manchester UCI Track World Cup 2007, event report| author=Phil Ingham| date=24 February 2007}}</ref>}}

A month later, on the [[29 March]], Reade went on to take first place in Team Sprint at the [[UCI Track World Championships, Women|UCI Track Cycling World Championships]] in [[Palma de Mallorca]] along with track cycling veteran [[Victoria Pendleton]]. It was also the first ever Women's Team Sprint Gold Medal title in that event. Their winning time was 33.631 seconds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.velonews.com/article/11952| publisher=Velonews.com| title=Huff scores bronze in omnium as Wiggins takes pursuit final| author=Andrew Hood| date=29 March 2007}}</ref> Reade was a last minute replacement for Anna Blyth,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cyclingnews.com/track.php?id=riders/2007/interviews/shanaze_reade07| publisher=cyclingnews.com| title=An interview with Shanaze Reade: Dream Debut on Track| author=Shane Stokes| date=27 April 2007}}</ref> Reade's partner at her first track racing event a month prior.

Reade is still active in track racing but on hiatus, concentrating on BMX for the events first ever inclusion in the [[2008 Olympic Games]].
