'''Cardiff Arms Park''' ([[Welsh language|Welsh]]: ''Parc yr Arfau Caerdydd''), also known as '''The Arms Park''', is a [[rugby union]] [[stadium]] situated in the centre of [[Cardiff]], [[Wales]]. The history of the rugby ground starts with the first [[Bleacher|stands]] appearing for spectators in the ground in 1881&ndash;1882,<ref name="Reminiscences" /> although the Arms Park had [[cricket]] played on the site since [[1848]].<ref name="Cricket ground">{{cite web |url= http://cricketarchive.com/Glamorgan/History/Cardiff_Arms_Park/Creation.html |publisher=  Glamorgan County Cricket Club & CricketArchive |title= Cardiff Arms Park, A short History - The Creation of the Arms Park |accessdate=2008-05-21}}</ref>  It is today the home to two rugby union teams, the [[Cardiff Blues]] and [[Cardiff RFC|Cardiff Rugby Football Club]].<ref name="famous">{{cite web |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/wales/1092730.stm |publisher=BBC |title= Arms Park groundsman's dream job |accessdate=2008-04-23}}</ref>  

Until [[1966]], the site had a cricket ground to the north and a rugby ground to the south. The cricket ground was home to the only Welsh [[first-class cricket]] club, [[Glamorgan County Cricket Club]].  The rugby ground was host to the [[1958 British Empire and Commonwealth Games|British Empire and Commonwealth Games]] in 1958 and home to Cardiff RFC and the [[Wales national rugby union team]]. From 1970, the site had two rugby union stadiums: the Cardiff Rugby Ground, which had replaced the cricket ground, and the National Stadium. The National Stadium was home to the Wales national rugby union team and it was officially opened on [[7 April]]&nbsp;[[1984]], however by [[1999]] the [[Millennium Stadium]] had replaced it as the [[national stadium]] of Wales. The Cardiff Rugby Ground has remained the home of Cardiff RFC, yet the future of the rugby stadium is in doubt, with the announcement in [[2007]] that the Cardiff Blues will be moving to the [[new Cardiff City stadium]] in August [[2009]].          

The site has been host to many sports, apart from rugby union and cricket; they include [[Athletics (track and field)|athletics]], [[association football]], [[greyhound racing]], [[tennis]],<ref name="Tennis">{{cite web |url= http://cricketarchive.com/Glamorgan/History/Sophia_Gardens/Post_War.html |publisher= Glamorgan County Cricket Club & CricketArchive |title= Post-war developments in Sophia Gardens |accessdate=2008-03-17}}</ref> [[British baseball]] and [[boxing]].  The site also has a [[bowling green]] to the north of Cardiff Rugby Ground, which is used by Cardiff Athletic Bowls Club, this is the bowls section of the [[Cardiff Athletic Club]].<ref name="Bowling green">{{cite web |url= http://icwales.icnetwork.co.uk/expats/expats-newsletter/page.cfm?objectid=17989536&method=full&siteid=50082|publisher= Media Wales (icWales.co.uk) |title= Old battles reignite over shared ground plans|accessdate=2008-05-21}}</ref>  The National Stadium also hosted many music concerts including [[The Rolling Stones]], [[U2]] and [[Michael Jackson]].                  

== History ==

The Cardiff Arms Park site was originally called the Great Park,<ref name="Centenary">{{cite journal | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 2006| month = | title = The Cardiff Centenary Walk | journal = | volume = | issue = | pages = | id = | url = | accessdate = 2008-05-11 | quote = }}</ref> a swampy meadow behind the Cardiff Arms Hotel.  Cardiff Arms Park was named after this [[hotel]]/[[public house|pub]], however by [[1878]], the building had been demolished.<ref name="Demolished">{{cite web |url= http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=48207 |publisher= University of London & History of Parliament Trust |title= 'The older inns of Cardiff', Cardiff Records: volume 5 (1905), pp. 438-445. |accessdate=2008-04-26}}</ref>

From [[1803]], the Cardiff Arms Hotel and the Park had became the property of the [[Marquess of Bute|Bute]] family.<ref name="Cricket ground" /><ref name="Bute">{{cite web |url= http://www.glamro.gov.uk/check/Building%20of%20a%20Capital%202/Teach/a_recreation.html |publisher= Glamorgan Record Office |title= Parks and Gardens |accessdate=2008-04-26}}</ref> The Arms Park soon became a popular place for sporting events, and by [[1848]], Cardiff Cricket Club was using the site for its cricket matches.<ref name="Cricket ground" />  The [[John Crichton-Stuart, 3rd Marquess of Bute|3rd Marquess of Bute]] stipulated that the ground could only be used for "recreational purposes".<ref name="Bute" />  At that time Cardiff Arms Park had a [[cricket]] ground to the north and a rugby union ground to the south.

1881&ndash;2 saw the first stands for spectators; it held 300 spectators and cost GB<U+00A3>50.<ref name="Reminiscences">{{cite book |last= "Red Dragon" |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title= ''Reminiscences of the Cardiff Rugby Football Club'', "Opening ceremony of the new stands, Cardiff Arms Park", [[5 October]]&nbsp;[[1912]]| |year= [[1912]] |publisher= Cardiff Rugby Football Club |location=|pages=}}</ref>  In [[1890]], new standing areas were constructed along the entire length of the ground, with additional stands erected in 1896.<ref name="Stands"/> 

=== Redevelopment of 1912 ===

By 1912 the Cardiff Football Ground, as it was then known, had a new south stand and temporary stands on the north, east and west ends of the ground.<ref name="Reminiscences" /> The south stand was covered, while the north terrace was initially without a roof.<ref name="Reminiscences" />  The improvements were partly funded by the WRU.<ref name="Stands" />  The opening ceremony took place on [[5 October]]&nbsp;[[1912]], with a match between [[Newport RFC]] and Cardiff RFC.  The new ground was opened by [[Lord Ninian Crichton-Stuart]].<ref name="Reminiscences" /> This new development increased the ground capacity to 43,000 and much improved the facilities at the ground compared to the earlier stands.<ref name="Reminiscences" /><ref name="Stands">{{cite web |url= http://cricketarchive.com/Glamorgan/History/Cardiff_Arms_Park/Rugby.html|publisher=Glamorgan County Cricket Club & CricketArchive |title=Rugby at Cardiff Arms Park |accessdate=2008-02-16}}</ref>

In [[1922]] [[John Crichton-Stuart, 4th Marquess of Bute]], had sold the entire site and it was bought by the Cardiff Arms Park Company Limited for GB<U+00A3>30,000, it was then leased to the Cardiff Athletic Club (cricket and rugby sections) for 99 years at a cost of <U+00A3>200 per annum.<ref name="Arms Park Limited">{{cite web |url= http://icwales.icnetwork.co.uk/0750expats/newsletter/tm_headline=old-battles-reignite-over-shared-ground-plans&method=full&objectid=17989536&page=2&siteid=50082-name_page.html |publisher= icWales |title= Old battles reignite over shared ground plans - Members stand firmly behind their club's historical base |accessdate=2008-04-26}}</ref><ref name="Development">{{cite journal |last= Harris [[CBE]] LLD (Hons)|first= Kenneth M|authorlink= |coauthors= |title= ''The Story of the Development of the National Rugby Ground'' [[April 7]]&nbsp;[[1984]]| |year= [[1984]] |publisher= [[Welsh Rugby Union]] |location=|pages=}}</ref>

=== New North Stand and South Stand redevelopments ===
 
During [[1934]] the cricket pavilion had been demolished to make way for the new North Stand,<ref name="Cricket ground" /> which was built on the rugby union ground, costing around <U+00A3>20,000.<ref name="Record Office">{{cite web |url= http://www.glamro.gov.uk/check/Building%20of%20a%20Capital%202/A_Leisure.html |publisher= Glamorgan Record Office |title= ''Cardiff: the building of a capital'' |accessdate=2008-05-05}}</ref>  However in [[1941]] the new North Stand and part of the west [[Terrace (stadium)|terracing]] had been badly damaged in [[the Blitz]] by the [[Luftwaffe]] during the [[Second World War]].<ref name="Millennium">{{cite web |url= http://www.millenniumstadium.com/3473_3558.php  |pubnbsplisher= Millennium Stadium plc |title= History of the Millennium Stadium-Cardiff Arms Park Site |accessdate=2008-04-29}}</ref>

At a general meeting of the [[Welsh Rugby Union]] (WRU) in June&nbsp;[[1953]], they made a decision, "That until such time as the facilities at [[Swansea]] were improved, all international matches be played at Cardiff".<ref name="Development" /> At the same time, plans were made for a new South Stand, which was estimated to cost <U+00A3>60,000, however the [[Tendering|tender]] price came out at GB<U+00A3>90,000, a compromise was made, and it was decided to build a new upper South Stand costing <U+00A3>64,000 instead, with the Cardiff Athletic Club contributing <U+00A3>15,000 and the remainder coming from the WRU.<ref name="Development" /> The new South Stand opened in [[1956]], in time for the 1958 British Empire and Commonwealth Games.<ref name="Millennium" /> This brought the overall capacity of the Arms Park up to 60,000, of which 12,800 spectators were seated and the remained standing.<ref name="Stands" /><ref name="Millennium" />

[[Image:Cardiff Arms Park New North Stand.jpg|thumb|left|The new North Stand,<br> rugby ground, Cardiff Arms Park]]  

The Arms Park hosted the 1958 British Empire and Commonwealth Games, which was used for the [[Athletics (track and field)|athletics]] events, but this event caused damage to the drainage system, so much so, that other rugby unions ([[Rugby Football Union|England]], [[Scottish Rugby Union|Scotland]] and [[Irish Rugby Football Union|Ireland]]) complained after the Games about the state of the pitch.<ref name="Development" />  The Development Committee was set up to resolve this issue on a permanent basis. They looked at various sites in Cardiff, but they all proved to be unsatisfactory.<ref name="Development" />  They also could not agree a solution with the Cardiff Athletic Club, so they purchased about 80 acres of land at Island Farm in [[Bridgend]],<ref name="Development" /> which was previously used as a [[prisoner-of-war camp]].  It is best known for the being the camp where the biggest escape attempt was made by German [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] in [[Great Britain]] during the [[Second World War]].<ref name="Island">{{cite web |url= http://www.islandfarm.fsnet.co.uk/ |publisher= www.islandfarm.fsnet.co.uk/ |title= Island Farm, Prisoner of War Camp: 198 / Special Camp: XI |accessdate=2007-08-15}}</ref>  Due to problems including transport issues [[Glamorgan County Council]] never gave outline planning permission for the proposals and by June&nbsp;[[1964]] the scheme was abandoned.<ref name="Development" />  At that stage, the cricket ground to the north was still being used by [[Glamorgan County Cricket Club]], and the rugby union ground to the south was used by the national Wales team and Cardiff RFC.  

By [[7 October]]&nbsp;[[1966]], the first floodlit game was held at Cardiff Arms Park, a game in which Cardiff RFC beat [[Barbarian F.C.|the Barbarians]] by 12 points to 8.<ref name="Cardiff Time">{{cite web |url= http://pirate.cardiffschools.net/index1.htm|publisher=Cardiff Council |title=Cardiff Timeline |accessdate=2008-04-29}}</ref>

=== The National Stadium ===

The National Stadium, which was also known as the Welsh National Rugby Ground, was designed by Osborne V Webb & Partners and built by G A Williamson & Associates of [[Porthcawl]] and Andrew Scott & Company of [[Port Talbot]].
<ref name="Library">{{cite web |url= http://www.gtj.org.uk/en/item10/10307 |publisher= Culturenet Cymru |title= Cardiff Arms Park, 1997 |accessdate=2008-05-01}}</ref>

[[Image:Cardiff Arms Park.jpg|thumb|left|<center>The National Stadium (left) and Cardiff Rugby Ground (right) both on an east-west alignment</center>]]

After agreement from the Cardiff Athletic Club, the freehold of the south ground was transferred solely to the WRU in July [[1968]].<ref name="Development" />  Work could then begin on the new National Stadium.  Glamorgan County Cricket Club would move to [[Sophia Gardens]] and the cricket ground to the north would be demolished and a new rugby union stadium built for Cardiff RFC, who would move out of the south ground, allowing the National Stadium to be built, for the sole use of the national rugby union team.<ref name="Development" />

On [[17 October]]&nbsp;[[1970]], the new North Stand and the [[Cardiff RFC]] ground was completed, the North Stand cost just over GB<U+00A3>1 million.<ref name="Development" />  The West Stand was opened in [[1977]] and the new East Terrace was completed by March&nbsp;[[1980]].  By the time the final South Stand had been completed and the Stadium officially opened on [[7 April]]&nbsp;[[1984]], the South Stand had cost <U+00A3>4.5M.  At the start of the project, the total cost was estimated at <U+00A3>2.25M, although by time it was finished in 1984, it had risen by nearly four times that amount.<ref name="Development" />  
  
The two stadiums on the site both had approximately east-west alignment; the [[Cardiff RFC|Cardiff Rugby]] Ground to the north (Castle Street) end, and the National Stadium to the south (Wood Street) end.  The original capacity was 65,000 but this had to be reduced in later years to 53,000 for safety reasons.  11,000 of these were on the East Terrace and the conversion to [[all-seater stadium]] would have reduced the stadium capacity still further to 47,500.  This capacity would have been much less than [[Twickenham Stadium|Twickenham]] and the other major rugby venues and also less than the demand for tickets to major events.<ref name="Stadia">{{cite web |url= http://www.panstadia.com/vol3/33-022.htm |publisher= www.panstadia.com |title= In the heart of the city|accessdate=2008-05-01}}</ref>

The first evening game to be played under [[Floodlights (sport)|floodlights]] was held on [[4 September]]&nbsp;[[1991]] at 8.00pm, between Wales and [[France national rugby union team|France]].

=== The Millennium Stadium ===

{{main|Millennium Stadium}}

Just thirteen years later in [[1997]], the National Stadium was considered too small and did not have the facilities required of the time and it was demolished and a new stadium, the Millennium Stadium, was built in its place (completed to a north-south alignment and opened in June&nbsp;[[1999]]).  This would become the fourth redevelopment of the Cardiff Arms Park site.
<ref name="The Stadium">{{cite web |url= http://www.millenniumstadium.com/3473_3557.php |publisher= The [[Millennium Stadium]] |title= Background to the Millennium Stadium Project |accessdate=2008-05-05}}</ref>  Although the Millennium Stadium is on roughly two thirds of the old National Stadium site, it is not considered to be part of Cardiff Arms Park; therefore, Cardiff Arms Park is not used in the address of the Millennium Stadium.<ref name="Millennium">{{cite web |url= http://www.millenniumstadium.com/3473_3567.php |publisher= The Millennium Stadium |title= Millennium Stadium Address |accessdate=2008-05-05}}</ref>

== Present day ==

Now only the Cardiff Rugby Ground use the name Cardiff Arms Park, although it is also still physically attached to the Millennium Stadium at the North Stand, which is known colloquially as Glanmor's Gap (right), after Glanmor Griffiths, former chair, now President of the WRU.<ref name="Glanmor">{{cite web |url= http://icwales.icnetwork.co.uk/expats/expats-newsletter/page.cfm?objectid=17989536&method=full&siteid=50082 |publisher= icWales |title= Old battles reignite over shared ground plans |accessdate=2008-04-29}}</ref>  Cardiff Blues attract an average home gate attendance of 7,369 supporters,

[[Image:Cardiff Arms Park North Stand.jpg|left|thumb|<center>The North Stand at the Arms Park</center>]]

It was announced on [[19 September]]&nbsp;[[2007]], that the Cardiff Blues team were to move from Cardiff Arms Park for the season 2009&ndash;2010 to a [[New Cardiff City stadium|new stadium]] at [[Leckwith]] to become tenants of [[Cardiff City FC]]. There is now doubt about the future of Cardiff Arms Park after [[2010]].  Cardiff RFC Ltd, the company which runs Cardiff Blues and Cardiff RFC, still has a 15 year lease on the stadium but it is not known if the small crowds the second fifteen attracts for semi-professional rugby, would not be enough to justify the remaining at the ground by its owners.  The land is still owned by Cardiff Athletic Club, however it still has the original requirement on the lease, that the land will only be used for "recreational purposes", as stipulated by the Bute family.  But the Cardiff Arms Park site is a prime piece of [[real estate]] in the centre of Cardiff, which means that it may be difficult to sell the land to [[property developers]].  The estimated value of the whole Arms Park site could be at least GB<U+00A3>15 million, although with the "recreational use" requirement, its actual value could be a lot less than that figure.<ref name="Bowling green" />  A decision by Cardiff Athletic Club on the future of Cardiff Arms Park could be made during 2008.<ref name="Ninian">{{cite web |url= http://icwales.icnetwork.co.uk/0600soccer/0200news/tm_headline=stadium-switch-turns-spotlight-on-arms-park&method=full&objectid=19816411&siteid=50082-name_page.html |publisher=icWales (Media Wales) |title=Stadium switch turns spotlight on Arms Park |accessdate=2008-02-27}}</ref>

== Usage ==
=== Association football ===
[[Image:Programme for Wales vs W Germany.jpg|thumb|Football Association of Wales programme cover of the first international football match held at the National Stadium in 1989]]
The Riverside Football Club, founded in [[1899]], played some matches at the Arms Park until [[1910]], when they moved to [[Ninian Park]],<ref name="Record Office" /> and later became [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City Football Club]].

On [[31 May]]&nbsp;[[1989]], [[Wales national football team|Wales]] played its first international game against [[Germany national football team|West Germany]] at the National Stadium.  It was also the first ever international [[Association football|football]] match held in [[Great Britain]] that was watched by all-seater spectators.<ref name="Football">{{ cite journal | last = Pursey MBE| first = Ivor| authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 1989| month = May| title = History In The Making: Wales V.

=== Athletics (track and field) ===
In [[1958]], the British Empire and Commonwealth Games were held in Cardiff.  The event has been the biggest sporting event ever held in Wales, however it would not have been possible without the financial support given by the WRU and the Cardiff Athletic Club.<ref name="Development" />  Both the opening and closing ceremonies took place at Cardiff Arms Park, plus all the [[Athletics (track and field)|track and field]] events, on what had been the [[greyhound]] track.<ref name="Development" />  It would turn out to be the last time that [[South Africa at the Commonwealth Games|South Africa would participate in the Games]] until 1994.  South Africa withdrew from the [[Commonwealth Games]] in 1961.

=== Baseball & British baseball ===

[[Baseball]] was established early on in Cardiff, and one of the earliest of games to be held at the Arms Park was on [[18 May]]&nbsp;[[1918]].  It was a charity match in aid of the Prisoner of War Fund between Welsh and American teams of the U.S. Beaufort & U.S. Jupiter.  [[British baseball]] matches have also regularly taken place at the Arms Park and hosted the annual England versus Wales international game every four years.<ref name="Media">{{cite web |url= http://www.weltchmedia.com/baseball.html  |publisher= Welsh Baseball Union |title= The web page of the Welsh Baseball Union |accessdate=2008-05-06}}</ref><ref name="Albion">{{cite web |url= http://www.grangealbionbaseball.co.uk/9.html |publisher= Grange Albion Baseball Club |title= Grange Albion Baseball Club |accessdate=2008-05-06}}</ref>  The games are now usually held at [[Roath Park]].

=== Boxing ===
Around 25,000 spectators watched international [[boxing]] on [[1 October]]&nbsp;[[1993]], at the National Stadium with a [[World Boxing Council]] (WBC) [[Heavyweight]] title bout between [[Lennox Lewis]] and [[Frank Bruno]].

Only one [[List A cricket|List A]] game was ever played at the ground, and this was only the second match of its type: Glamorgan's [[Gillette Cup (England)|Gillette Cup]] fixture against [[Somerset County Cricket Club|Somerset]] on [[22 May]]&nbsp;[[1963]].<ref name="Gillette">{{cite web |url= http://www.cricketarchive.com/Glamorgan/Grounds/381_a.html |publisher= Glamorgan County Cricket Club & CricketArchive |title= Glamorgan List A Matches played on Cardiff Arms Park|accessdate=2008-05-06}}</ref>  Except for the aforementioned [[1910]] game, the only major match not to involve Glamorgan was a Test Trial in July [[1932]], which was badly affected by the weather and saw play on only one of the scheduled three days.

=== Greyhound racing ===
To help pay for the upkeep of the site, a greyhound track was opened in [[1927]].  The Arms Park (Cardiff) Greyhound Racing Company Limited signed a 50-year [[lease]] in [[1937]], with Cardiff Athletic Club, the owners of the Arms Park, having no rights to break the agreement or to review the rental until the 50 years were up.  However the last greyhound race was actually held at the National Stadium was on [[30 July]]&nbsp;[[1977]].<ref name="Cardiff Timeline">{{cite web |url= http://pirate.cardiffschools.net/index1.htm |publisher= cardiffschools.net |title= Cardiff Timeline|accessdate=2008-05-07}}</ref>

=== Rugby union ===
[[Image:70-09-10 programme.jpg|thumb|right|Welsh Rugby Union programme cover of the National Stadium in 1970]]
In 1876, the Cardiff RFC was formed and soon after they also used the park.  On [[12 April]]&nbsp;[[1884]], the first international match was played at the ground between Wales and [[Ireland national rugby union team|Ireland]], when 5,000 people watched Wales beat Ireland by 2 tries and a drop goal to nil.<ref name="Development" />
 
The Arms Park rugby ground became the permanent home of the [[Wales national rugby union team]] in [[1964]].  Later, the National Stadium was also home to the [[WRU Challenge Cup]] from [[1972]] until the last ever match held at the Stadium on [[26 April]]&nbsp;[[1997]], at a much reduced capacity, between Cardiff RFC and [[Swansea RFC]].  Cardiff RFC won the match by 33 point to 26, with the last try scored by [[Nigel Walker]].<ref name="Challenge Cup">{{cite web |url=http://www.wru.co.uk/86_641.php|publisher= Welsh Rugby Union Limited|title= Konica Minolta Cup: a brief history|accessdate=2008-05-07}}</ref>

The National Stadium hosted four games in the [[1991 Rugby World Cup]], including the 3rd / 4th place play-off.<ref name="World Cup">{{cite web |url= http://www.therugbyworldcup.co.uk/1991.html |publisher= therugbyworldcup.co.uk |title= RWC 1991 Staged in Europe |accessdate=2008-04-29}}</ref>  The National Stadium was also host to the inaugural [[Heineken Cup finals|Heineken Cup final]] of [[1995-96 Heineken Cup|1995-6]] when [[Stade Toulousain|Toulouse]] beat Cardiff RFC by 21 to 18 after extra time, in front of 21,800 spectators.<ref name="1995 Cup">{{cite web |url= http://www.ercrugby.com/eng/79_119.php
|publisher= ERC |title= Toulouse Win Inaugural Tournament |accessdate=2008-04-29}}</ref>  The following final in [[1996-97 Heineken Cup|1996-7]] was also held at the National Stadium, this time it was between [[CA Brive|Brive]] and [[Leicester Tigers]].  Brive won the match 28 points to 9, in front of a crowd of 41,664.<ref name="1996 Cup">{{cite web |url= http://www.ercrugby.com/eng/80_118.php |publisher= ERC |title= Brive the Champions |accessdate=2008-04-29}}</ref>  The Heineken Cup is Europe's premier [[Rugby Union]] club competition.

In 2008, the stadium will host Pool A matches in the [[2008 IRB Junior World Championship]] and also the semi-final on [[18 June]]&nbsp;[[2008]].

==== The greatest match, the greatest try ====

The stadium is best known as the venue for what some say was the "the greatest try ever scored" by [[Gareth Edwards]] for [[Barbarian F.C.|the Barbarians]] against the New Zealand [[All Blacks]] in what is also called "the greatest match ever played" on [[27 January]]&nbsp;[[1973]].<ref name="Index">{{cite web |url= http://www.sportingindex.com/extraspread/sports-zone/great-sporting-years.htm|publisher= Sporting Index Ltd |title= Greatest Sporting Years of the last 100 years - 1973 |accessdate=2008-05-11}}</ref><ref name="Amazon">{{cite web |url= http://www.amazon.com/1973-All-Blacks-Barbarians-DVD/dp/B000UO9CPK|publisher= Amazon.com, Inc.|title= 1973 All Blacks vs Barbarians DVD|accessdate=2008-05-11}}</ref>  The final score was 23 points to 11 to the Barbarians (this translates to 27 points to 13, in today's scoring system).   

<blockquote>

The game is one I will never forget and those of us who played in it will never be allowed to forget.  It is a match that will live with me forever. People tend only to remember the first four minutes of the game because of the try, but what they forgot is the great deal of good rugby played afterwards, much of which came from the All Blacks.  After the success of the 1971 Lions tour, which captured the imagination of the whole country, it was an opportunity to bring a lot of that side together again.<ref name="Barbarian">{{cite web |url= http://www.sportingo.com/Rugby/a2680_Was-this-greatest-rugby-try |publisher= SportBuzz |title=Was this the greatest rugby try of all time? |accessdate=2008-02-26}}</ref>

The scorers were for the Barbarians: [[Try|Tries]]: [[Gareth Edwards]], [[Fergus Slattery]], [[John Bevan (rugby player)|John Bevan]], [[J. P. R. Williams|J P R Williams]]; [[Try#Conversion|Conversions]]: [[Phil Bennett]] (2); [[Penalty (rugby)|Penalty]]: Phil Bennett.

== Singing tradition ==

The National Stadium was known primarily as the venue for massed voices singing such hymns as "[[Cwm Rhondda]]", "[[Calon L<U+00E2>n]]", "[[Men of Harlech]]" and "[[Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau]]" ("Land of my Fathers" - the [[national anthem]] of Wales).<ref name="Australian">{{cite web |url= http://www.auswelshmalechoir.org.au/pages/history1.html |publisher= The Australian Welsh Male Choir|title= Praise the Lord, we are a musical Nation|accessdate=2008-05-11}}</ref>  The legendary atmosphere including singing of the crowd was said to be worth at least a try or a goal to the home nation.<ref name="Singing">{{cite web |url= http://www.cardiffmatchday.co.uk/home.html |publisher=Cardiff Match Day |title= Cardiff Arms Park, The Millennium Stadium, Cardiff |accessdate=2008-02-27}}</ref>  This tradition of singing has now passed onto the Millennium Stadium.<ref name="Singing"/>   

The Arms Park has its own choir, called the Cardiff Arms Park Male Choir.  It was formed in [[1966]] as the Cardiff Athletic Club Male Voice Choir, and today performs internationally with a schedule of concerts and tours.  In [[2000]], the choir changed their name to become the Cardiff Arms Park Male Choir.<ref name="Choir">{{cite web |url= http://www.malevoicechoir.net/capmc/|publisher= www.cardiffarmsparkmalechoir.co.uk|title=Cardiff Arms Park Male Choir |accessdate=2008-05-11}}</ref>
