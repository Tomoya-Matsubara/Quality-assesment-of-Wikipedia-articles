'''Chaozhou''' ({{zh|c=<U+6F6E><U+5DDE>|p=Ch<U+00E1>ozh<U+014D>u|w=Ch'ao<U+00B2>-chou<U+00B9>|l=Tide Prefecture}}; alternatively spelled '''Chiu Chow'''), also widely known by its [[Chinese Postal Map Romanization|Postal map spelling]] '''Teochew''', is a city in eastern [[Guangdong]] [[province of China|province]] of the [[People's Republic of China]]. It borders [[Shantou]] to the south, [[Jieyang]] to the southwest, [[Meizhou]] to the northwest, the province of [[Fujian]] to the east, and the [[South China Sea]] to the southeast. It is administered as a [[prefecture-level city]] with a jurisdiction area of 3,614 square kilometers and a total population of 2,500,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chaozhou.gov.cn/czgk/index.asp?curMenuId=300 |title=Profile of Chaozhou|publisher=Official website of Chaozhou Government|accessdate=2008-09-30|language=Chinese}}</ref>
Chaozhou is part of the [[Chaoshan]] region.

==Administration==
Chaozhou's [[prefecture-level city|municipal]] executive, legislature and [[Intermediate People's Court|judiciary]] are situated in [[Xiangqiao District]] (<U+6E58><U+6865><U+533A>), together with its [[Communist Party of China|CPC]] and [[Public Security Bureau|Public Security]] bureaux.

Chaozhou contains one [[district of China|district]] and two [[County of China|counties]]:
* [[Fengxi District|Fengxi (<U+67AB><U+6EAA>)]]
* [[Raoping County|Raoping (<U+9976><U+5E73>)]]
* [[Chao'an County|Chao'an (<U+6F6E><U+5B89>)]]

==Geography and climate==
Chaozhou is located in the easternmost part of Guangdong Province, north of the coastal [[Shantou]] City. It is situated in the north of the delta of the [[Han River (Guangdong)|Han River]] (<U+97E9><U+6C5F>), which flows throughout the city.<!--Is it mountainous? Is that the reason for the term "Chaoshan"?-->

==History==
In 214 BC, Chaozhou was an undeveloped and named part of [[Nanhai Commandery|Nanhai]] [[Commandery]] (<U+5357><U+6D77><U+90E1>) of the [[Qin Dynasty]]. In 331{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} during the [[Eastern Han Dynasty]] (<U+6771><U+6C49>), [[Haiyang District|Haiyang]] (<U+6D77><U+967D><U+7E23>) was established as a part of [[Dongguan Commandery]] (<U+6771><U+5B98><U+90E1>).

[[Dongguan Commandery]] was renamed to [[Yi'an Commandery]] (<U+7FA9><U+5B89><U+90E1>) in 413. The commandery became a [[prefecture]] in 590 in the early [[Sui Dynasty]]; first as Xun Prefecture (<U+5FAA><U+5DDE>, ''Xunzhou''), then as Chao Prefecture (<U+6F6E><U+5DDE>, ''Chaozhou'') in the following year. In 1914, the [[Republic of China]] government combined Chao and Xun prefectures into Chaoxun Prefecture or Chaoxun [[Circuit (political division)|Circuit]] (<U+6F6E><U+5FAA><U+9053>).

For a short while in the [[Sui Dynasty|Sui]] and early [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]] Dynasties, [[Haiyang District]] was called [[Yi'an District]] (<U+7FA9><U+5B89><U+7E23>). The name remained Haiyang until 1914, when it was renamed to [[Chao'an County]] (<U+6F6E><U+5B89><U+7E23>) to avoid ambiguity with the [[Haiyang County]] of [[Shandong Province]].

The seat of the 1951 Guangdong People's Government was at Chao'an County, a part of it was created as Chao'an City in 1953 and later that year renamed to Chaozhou City (county-level). In 1955, the provincial seat moved to [[Shantou]]. Chaozhou City was abolished five years later, and reestablished again in 1979. In 1983, the situation was reversed, with Chao'an abolished and made a part of Chaozhou City. Chaozhou was made a provincially-administered city in January 1989, and a [[vice-prefecture-level city]] in January 1990. In December 1991, Chaozhou was further upgraded into its current statue of [[prefecture-level city]].

Together, Chaozhou and the nearby cities of [[Shantou]] (<U+6C55><U+5934>) and [[Jieyang]] (<U+63ED><U+9633>) are called [[Chaoshan]]. The name was used for the joint political-administrative area which encompassed the three cities from 1958 until 1983. For the next five years, Shantou City was a higher-level city containing Chaozhou and Jieyang within it. Currently, Chaozhou, Shantou and Jieyang are equal in status.

==Culture==
Chaozhou is famously known as one of the great cultural centres in the [[Lingnan]] region of China. Chaozhou culture is known worldwide as a unique part of world heritage. Down through history, the Chaozhou region, was able to flourish and thrive as a prosperous cultural centre enabling the nourishing of a unique and distinctive character epitomized in the [[Teochew dialect|Chaozhou Dialect]], Chaozhou opera, [[Chaozhou cuisine]], Chaozhou Ganghu tea, Chaozhou music, Chaozhou lion dance and Chaozhou embroidery.

[[Teochew dialect]] (<U+6F6E><U+5DDE><U+8A71>), by which the Chaozhou culture conveys, is considered as one of the oldest Chinese dialects for it preserves many elegant and refined features from ancient Chinese that have been lost in some of the other modern dialects of Chinese. It is spoken by about 10 million people in local Chaozhou and approximately 2-5 million overseas. 30% of the Chinese in Vietnam speak this dialect. Teochew people are the second largest ethnic Chinese group in [[Singapore]], after the [[Hoklo|Hokkien]] - although [[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin]] is gradually supplanting the Teochew topolect as the mother tongue for this group, especially among younger generations.

[[Image:Chaozhou Opera-Menglikung.jpg|thumb|right|225px|Chaozhou Opera]]
Chaozhou opera (<U+6F6E><U+5287>) is a traditional art form which has a history of more than 500 years and is now loved by 20 million Chaozhou natives in over 20 countries and regions. Based on the local folk dances and ballads, Chaozhou opera has formed its own style under the influence of [[Nanxi|Nanxi Opera]]. [[Nanxi]] is one of the oldest Chinese operas that originated in the [[Song Dynasty]]. Its tunes are graceful and pleasant, full of local color. The old form of choral accompaniment still remains its special features. Clowns and females are the most distinctive characters in a Chaozhou opera, and fan-playing and acrobatic skills are more prominent than in other types of performances.

[[Chinese tea ceremony|Gongfu tea]] ([[Chinese tea ceremony|<U+5DE5><U+592B><U+8336>]]), the 'espresso' of Chinese teas with a formidable kick, which was first sipped back in the [[Song Dynasty]], is still flourishing and remains an important part of social etiquette in Chaozhou. If you visit a family, you can be sure of at least one round of Ganghu tea. Though it tastes bitter when it first reaches your mouth, it is the lingering aftertaste that makes Ganghu tea probably the most charming tea culture in China. Drinking Ganghu tea is in fact a process of aesthetics rather than a solution to thirst.

At the local teahouse, tea service is often accompanied with Chaozhou music (<U+6F6E><U+5DDE><U+97F3><U+6A02>). [[Chaozhou xianshi|String music]], the gong and drum music, the ancient music of set flutes<!--what are "set flutes"? This is a poor translation--> are the traditional play forms of Chaozhou music. Chaozhou string music is made up of mostly plucked and bowed string instruments, and on some occasions, wind instruments are used. The most characteristic instruments are the ''rihin''<!--where does the romanization "rihin" come from?--> (<U+4E8C><U+5F26>), ''[[Tihu (instrument)|tihu]]'' (<U+63D0><U+80E1>) and ''[[yehu|yahu]]''<!--Where does the romanization "yahu" come from?--> (all two-stringed bowed lutes), the ''[[sanxian]]'', ''[[pipa]]'', ''[[ruan]]'', ''[[guzheng]]'', and ''[[yangqin]]''. The number of instruments and performers in the ensemble is flexible and depends on the availability of instruments and musicians to play them - but to have an even and balanced texture only one of each instrument is preferred. Chaozhou drum music includes the big drum and gong, the small drum and gong, the dizi set drum and dong and su drum and gong ensembles. The current Chaozhou drum music is said to be similar to the form of the Drum and Wind Music of the Han and Tang Dynasties. The Chaozhou ''[[guzheng]]'' (<U+6F6E><U+5DDE><U+53E4><U+7B5D>) is also regarded as a major member of the southern guzheng family.

==Economy==
In 2006, [[GDP]] of the whole city totaled 33.0 billion yuan, up by 13% over the previous year. Agricultural output value reached 5.732 billion yuan, dropped by 3.1%. Industrial output value amounted to 64.9 billion yuan, representing an increase of 16.4%. Seven pillar industries of ceramics, garment, food, plastics, electronics, stainless steel products and printing achieved above-scale industrial output value of 22.92 billion yuan, up by 30.3%, accounting for 62.7% of the total above-scale industrial output value. The proportion of the three industries to the aggregate of [[GDP]] was 9.5:56.2:34.3 in 2006. Local financial revenue in the general budget increased to 1065 million yuan, up 23.2%. The gross value of import and export added to US$2.3 billion, representing an increase of 21.3%. Overall consumer product retail sales came to 11.814 billion yuan, representing an increase of 14.7%. Consumption on transport and telecommunication, garment, health care and housing showed massive growth.

==Tourism==
Chaozhou is a famous historical and cultural city in the country. The city's feature is known as "Classic Tourist City" which receives numerous tourists both from abroad and home. There are many valuable historic relics in Chaozhou city, totally about 600 units and among them 42 are classified as the state, provincial and city's key preservation units of cultural relics. The [[Teochew dialect|Chaozhou Dialect]], [[Chaozhou opera]], Chaozhou [[Chinese tea ceremony|Ganghu tea]], etc. have unique features of Chaozhou culture, attracting numerous tourists from home and abroad, and are the richly endowed tourist resources.

* [[Beige Fodeng]]<U+2014>The Lighthouse of Buddha (<U+5317><U+95A3><U+4F5B><U+71C8>). The lighthouse was used for boats in the Hanjiang river as this part of the river was dangerous. The lighthouse could remind people that they were in Chaozhou area and ought to be careful. It is said a former emperor once passed in his "dragon boat" while he was sleeping and was woken by the light from this Lighthouse. He thought it must have been  a bodhisattva sending him the light and therefore named it the "lighthouse of Buddha".
* [[Guangji Bridge|Guangzi Bridge (<U+5EE3><U+6FDF><U+6A4B>)]], built in the [[Southern Song Dynasty]] (1170 A.D.).
* [[Huang Jilue Temple]] (<U+5DF1><U+7565><U+9EC3><U+516C><U+7960>), displaying the wood carving art of Chaozhou in the Qing Dynasty.
* The old site of [[Song Kiln]], that shows the scale of production and the exquisite craftsmanship of ceramic in ancient Chaozhou.
* [[Jiadixiang]] (<U+7532><U+7B2C><U+5DF7>), the ancient family houses.
* Kaiyuan Temple (<U+958B><U+5143><U+5BFA>) is a Buddhist center embodied with the quintessence of the architectural art of various dynasties such as the Tang, the Song, the Yuan and the Qing. This temple is over 200 years old. The temple is also home to the most influential Buddhism Study Institute in Southeast China. Inside, handsome calligraphy and inscribed steles remind visitors that this temple once functioned as the record keeper of the city.
* Night scene of the People's Square.

* [[Xi Hu Yuan]], a museum in the main city park, has a unique collection unique of stones with natural geological markings representing (or resembling) Chinese characters.

==Miscellaneous==
* The township of [[Chaojhou]] in western [[Pingtung County]], [[Taiwan]] is named after Chaozhou.

* The Chaozhou people form the second largest group amongst the ethnic Chinese in [[Singapore]], after the [[Hokkien]]s, comprising 21% of [[Chinese Singaporean]]s. Teochew was originally the dominant language amongst the Chinese immigrants in Singapore, until it was superseded by the Hokkiens due to later immigration flows. Concentrations of Chaozhou people once settled along the banks of the [[Singapore River]] as well as the [[Straits of Johor]], until urban development and the redistribution of the people in [[public housing in Singapore|public housing development]] diluted this geographic trend, although they are still known to concentrate in the northeast such as in [[Hougang]]. Traditional commercial sectors of Chinatown once dominated by Teochews include Circular Road and South Bridge Road. Chaozhou peoples also founded rural settlements and were active in the plantation industry, and gave rise to modern place names such as [[Choa Chu Kang]], [[Lim Chu Kang]] and [[Yio Chu Kang]]. Today, the Chaozhou people continue to be represented by various clans and association, one of the most prominent being the [[Ngee Ann Kongsi]], which built schools such as the [[Ngee Ann Secondary School]] and also went into real-estate ([[Ngee Ann City]]). Much effort has been made to preserve their distinct identity and culture under the heavy influence of the Hokkiens, including through the airing of a popular television drama, ''[[The Teochew Family]]'' (<U+6F6E><U+5DDE><U+5BB6><U+65CF>) in 1995 by [[MediaCorp]]'s [[MediaCorp Channel 8|Channel 8]].

* There is also a large number of Teochew people in [[Penang]], [[Malaysia]]. In the early 19th century some Teochew people settled here and in 1855, they founded the Teochew Association, which also includes a temple in Chulia Street, [[George Town, Penang|George Town]]. The community continued to grow until in 1919, a school named after the [[Han River]], [[Han Chiang School]], was founded to provide education for the people. Today, during some large occasions, the Teochew community still holds Teochew operas here. Other than that, Han Chiang School went on to become one of the most famous education institutions in Penang. They have 3 schools, namely [[SJK(C) Han Chiang]], [[Han Chiang High School]] and [[Han Chiang College]].
 
* There is a large population of Chaozhou people in [[Hong Kong]].  When mainland China opened its gate in the 1950s, there was an exodus of refugees into Hong Kong to flee the communist rule. Refugees from Chaozhou banded together in very tight communities. They were known to be very generous of helping refugees from their own regions.  They spoke their own Teochew dialect amongst themselves, hence they stood out among the locals when almost everybody else spoke Cantonese in Hong Kong. The locals called them by the name "Chiu Chow Loun", where Chiu Chow is the Cantonese pronunciation of their origin, Teo Chew and Nang is the Teochew pronunciation of the word "people". They were known to be a very hardworking people and they were good at running small businesses.  Back in the 1960s, almost every "rice store" (grocery stores for dried food and uncooked rice) in Hong Kong were owned by "Chiu Chow Loun". Decades and generations later, the offspring of these immigrants blended into the rest of the communities.  Large corporation run supermarkets drove many "rice stores" out of business.  Chiu Chow Loun no longer as stood out as special communities in Hong Kong, though they are still very active in organizing charity activities, especially around the "ghost festival" in the seventh month of the Chinese calendar. See [[Teochew people]] for more details.

* There is a large population of Chaozhou people in [[Pontianak]] and [[Ketapang]], Indonesia. Teochew is the main lingua franca used among the Chinese, and Teochew are the dominant ethnic Chinese group in Pontianak and Ketapang.
