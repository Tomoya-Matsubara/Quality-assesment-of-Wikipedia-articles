'''Blair Cornelia Waldorf'''<ref>von Ziegesar, ''Gossip Girl: I Will Always Love You'', p. 336</ref> is the main character of the ''[[Gossip Girl (novel series)|Gossip Girl]]'' franchise,<ref>{{cite news |first=James |last=Morrison |coauthors= |title=Protests at sex and drugs in teen publishing sensation |work=independent.co.uk |page= |date=August 25, 2002 |accessdate=December 2, 2010 |url=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:l7ocvsJ7bkkJ:www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/news/protests-at-sex-and-drugs-in-teen-publishing-sensation-640904.html+http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/news/protests-at-sex-and-drugs-in-teen-publishing-sensation-640904.html&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us}}</ref> introduced in the original series of novels and also appearing in their [[Gossip Girl|television]] and [[manga]] adaptations.

Due to her position as [[Queen bee (subculture)|queen bee]] of [[Manhattan]]'s social scene, Blair's actions and relations are under constant scrutiny from the mysterious Gossip Girl, a popular [[blog]]ger. 

[[Leighton Meester]], who portrays the character in the television series, has described the character as being insecure about her social status.<ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |coauthors= |title=''Gossip Girl'' Actress Spills the Beans on Her Character |work=buddytv.com |page= |date=September 25, 2007 |accessdate=October 9, 2008 |url=http://www.buddytv.com/articles/gossip-girl/gossip-girl-the-new-cw-11418.aspx}}</ref> At times, this anxiety creates flaws and complexities which contribute to character development. In Meester's view, the true Blair is ultimately a "good girl" at heart.<ref>{{cite news |first= Siobhan|last= Duck|coauthors= |title=Queen bee is really a good girl |work=news.com.au |page= |date=December 17, 2007 |accessdate=October 9, 2008 |url=http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/story/0,23739,22943161-5003422,00.html}}</ref>

Blair has been compared to vintage film and literary figures, including [[Becky Sharp (character)|Becky Sharp]] and [[The Eustace Diamonds|Lizzie Eustace]]. Meester's portrayal has also drawn comparisons to roles played by [[Joan Collins]] and [[Audrey Hepburn]]. She is the most critically acclaimed character of the franchise, while the television character has drawn real-life attention surrounding fashion, physical abuse, and a love triangle.

==Character in print==
''[[Gossip Girl (novel series)|Gossip Girl]]'' is a series of novels about socially prominent young adults in [[New York City]]. The story primarily follows Blair Waldorf and her friend [[Serena van der Woodsen]] during their years in high school and college. Due to her fame on the Upper East Side, Blair is featured on the Website of "Gossip Girl", an anonymous gossip [[blog]]ger whose 'posts' appear occasionally throughout the story.

===Novel series===
In the first book, Blair is introduced as a privileged, comically vain overachiever.<ref name=NYreview>{{cite news |first=Janet |last=Malcolm |coauthors= |title=The Wicked Joy of the ''Gossip Girl'' Novels |work=[[The New Yorker]] |page= |date=March 10, 2008 |accessdate=July 9, 2009 |url=http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/atlarge/2008/03/10/080310crat_atlarge_malcolm}}</ref> She is described as an alluring brunette,<ref name=Blair>{{cite news |first=Cecily |last=von Ziegesar |coauthors= |title=''It Had To Be You: The Gossip Girl Prequel'' |work=Poppy (Little, Brown and Company) |page= |year=2009 |accessdate=July 12, 2011 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=NF6T9CbK7h0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=It+Had+To+Be+You+Gossip+Girl#v=snippet&q=two%20hottest&f=false}}</ref> and occasionally models her appearance and demeanor after famous actresses, including [[Marilyn Monroe]] and, frequently, [[Audrey Hepburn]].<ref>von Ziegesar, ''Gossip Girl: Because I'm Worth It'', p. 36</ref> In early novels, the character is also written as [[Bulimia nervosa|bulimic]]. 

Blair is largely motivated by matters surrounding family, romance, and ambition. However, her tendency to overachieve can lead to feelings of paranoia, with dramatic or comic results. In a review for ''[[The New Yorker]]'', Janet Malcolm remarked that Blair's issues made her "both a broader caricature and a more real person" than the other ''Gossip Girl'' characters.<ref name=NYreview/> In a 2009 interview, ''Gossip Girl'' creator [[Cecily von Ziegesar]] claimed to identify with Blair the most, noting that the character "is so unpredictable and dramatic. Such a bitch, but we understand why she is a bitch and we like her anyway".<ref name=qa>{{cite news |first= |last= |coauthors= |title=Hon <U+00E4>r en s<U+00E5>n bitch |work=aftonbladet.se |page= |date=March 26, 2009 |accessdate=July 16, 2011 |url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/nojesbladet/article4748648.ab?service=print}}</ref>

====Story lines====
Throughout most of the series' run, Blair grapples with a number of changes within her family. Two years prior to the opening novel, Blair's parents divorced after her father revealed himself to be gay. When her mother remarries, and her father leaves the country, Blair has difficulty accepting her stepfather. In addition, her stress over these matters occasionally affects her other relationships.<ref>von Ziegesar, ''You Know You Love Me: A Gossip Girl Novel'', p. 30</ref> However, Blair ultimately remains close to her father Harold, who she often turns to for comfort.<ref>von Ziegesar, ''You Know You Love Me: A Gossip Girl Novel'', p. 3</ref> By contrast, she maintains a tense relationship with her mother Eleanor.<ref>von Ziegesar, ''Gossip Girl: Because I'm Worth It'', p. 81</ref>

In the opening novel, Blair learns of an affair between her friend Serena and her boyfriend Nate. This marks the beginning of the story's primary [[love triangle]], which recurs throughout the series.<ref>{{cite news |first=Shannon |last=Maughan |coauthors= |title=''Gossip Girl''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Got Legs |work=[[Publisher's Weekly]] |page= |date=June 11, 07 |accessdate=July 12, 2011 |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/new-titles/adult-announcements/article/1412-gossip-girl--s-got-legs-.html}}</ref> Blair's romantic life has various effects on her character development. After Nate repeatedly hurts her, she eventually refuses to take him back until she believes in his ability to commit to her.<ref>{{cite news |first=Cecily |last=von Ziegesar |coauthors= |title=''Gossip Girl: I Will Always Love You'' "The Honest Truth and Other Rewards" |work=Poppy (Little, Brown and Company) |page= |year=2009 |accessdate=July 23, 2011 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=md8WgIIJjSUC&q=four+months+ago#v=snippet&q=four%20months%20ago&f=false}}</ref> In pursuing Nate, however, Blair herself cheats on her new boyfriend Pete, which results in her losing both of them.<ref>{{cite news |first=Cecily |last=von Ziegesar |coauthors= |title=''Gossip Girl: I Will Always Love You'' |work=Poppy (Little, Brown and Company) |page= |year=2009 |accessdate=July 23, 2011 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=md8WgIIJjSUC&q=love+triangle+Pete#v=snippet&q=love%20triangle%20Pete&f=false}}</ref> She eventually begins to acknowledge her mistakes, with her father's help.<ref name=IWA>{{cite news |first=Cecily |last=von Ziegesar |coauthors= |title=''Gossip Girl: I Will Always Love You'' |work=Poppy (Little, Brown and Company) |page= |year=2009 |accessdate=July 12, 2011 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=md8WgIIJjSUC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Gossip+Girl:+I+Will+Always+Love+You#v=onepage&q=Harold&f=false}}</ref> She later grows closer to [[Chuck Bass]] (which initially occurred in the series' television adaptation), who she'd previously known for years, which leads them to briefly date one another.<ref name=IWA/>

Blair is noted for an over-achieving nature, which often appears in humorous scenes. In a review for ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine, Emily Nussbaum lauded one of Blair's fantasies, which involves "joining the Peace Corps, getting a killer tan, winning the Nobel Peace Prize, and having dinner with the president, 'who would then write her a recommendation to [[Yale University|Yale]], and then Yale would fall all over themselves to accept her.' "<ref name=nyarticle>{{cite news |first=Emily |last=Nussbaum |coauthors= |title=Psst, Serena is a slut.

She is pure naked striving, restlessly seeking an object, any object, and never knowing when enough is enough."<ref name=NYreview/> 

Blair encounters a setback during her interview at Yale by revealing the recent stress in her life, and then kissing her interviewer on the cheek upon dismissal. Her father then makes a donation to the school, though Blair is still wait-listed.<ref>{{cite news |first=Cecily |last=von Ziegesar |coauthors= |title=''All I Want Is Everything: A Gossip Girl Novel'' |work=Poppy (Little, Brown and Company) |page= |year=2003 |accessdate=July 12, 2011 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=qEE8K98qfkQC&pg=PA5&dq=Gossip+Girl+Yale+donate#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref> In the twelfth book, ''I Will Always Love You'', it is revealed that she has been admitted to the university.<ref>von Ziegesar, ''Gossip Girl: I Will Always Love You'', p. 9</ref>

In addition to her feelings for Nate, Blair is sometimes said to feel competitive with Serena in other areas, including matters of beauty and popularity.<ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |coauthors= |title=Cecily von Ziegesar Biography |work=bookrags.com |page= |date= |accessdate=July 16, 2011 |url=http://www.bookrags.com/biography/cecily-von-ziegesar-aya/}}</ref> This also leads to an occasional envy on Blair's part.<ref name=nyarticle/> It is unclear how much of Blair's perception of Serena is in line with reality; the narrative describes both characters as "hands down the two hottest girls on the Upper East Side, and maybe all of Manhattan, or even the whole world."<ref name=Blair/>

===Manga series===
[[Image:MangaBWaldorf.jpg|thumb|130px|right|alt=A manga drawing of Blair Waldorf|Blair as she appears in the manga.]]
In 2010, [[Yen Press]] began publishing a [[manga]] adaptation titled ''Gossip Girl: For Your Eyes Only'', written and illustrated by HyeKyung Baek. This series adapts notable scenarios from the novel<U+2014>including the triangle with Nate and Serena<U+2014>but also features new material. 

After losing her position as queen bee, Blair attempts to regain her former status while adjusting to a less privileged lifestyle.<ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |coauthors= |title=Gossip Girl: The Manga, Vol. 2 |work=hachettebookgroup.com |page= |date= |accessdate=July 30, 2011 |url=http://www.hachettebookgroup.com/books_9780759530270.htm}}</ref> In addition to this series, Blair also appears in a manga adaptation of the novel ''Gossip Girl: Psycho Killer'', a parody of horror stories.<ref>{{cite news |first=Kat |last=Rosenfield |coauthors= |title=''Gossip Girl: Psycho Killer'' Special Edition Manga: EXCLUSIVE First Look! |work=mtv.com |page= |date=July 25, 2011 |accessdate=July 30, 2011 |url=http://hollywoodcrush.mtv.com/2011/07/25/gossip-girl-psycho-killer-exclusive/}}</ref>

==TV series==
In 2007, ''Gossip Girl'' was [[Gossip Girl|adapted for television]]. According to Cecily von Ziegesar, the television character is largely faithful to the original.<ref name=qa/> Among the aspects to be maintained are her admiration for Audrey Hepburn and her interest in Yale University. However, the series excludes Blair's brother Tyler. The show also explores romances between Blair and multiple male leads, resulting in occasional love triangles. 

Among fans and the media, Blair's bond with Chuck Bass is commonly known by the portmanteau "Chair", while her relationship with Dan Humphrey is referred to as "Dair". The nicknames and viewer interest in these relationships have been recognized by the show's producers.<ref>{{cite news |first=Vlada |last=Gelman |coauthors= |title=Gossip Girl Boss Previews Blair and Her Men, Serena's New Life, and Exploiting the UES

Prior to the show's debut in 2007, the actress stated that, "The only way to play Blair, or any character, and make her human, is to find what she is inside me. And I know I have my insecurities, too." She went on to say that "the way Blair and I are ''not'' alike when it comes to insecurities is: ''She'' pays ''so'' much attention to hers!"<ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |coauthors= |title=Leighton Meester: rich on 'Gossip Girl' |work=[[Associated Press]] |page= |date=September 12, 2007 |accessdate=August 11, 2010 |url=http://www.ctv.ca/CTVNews/Entertainment/20070912/leighton_gossip_070912/}}</ref> Meester's casting was described by ''[[Yahoo!]]'' as a star-making role which moved her "into the pop culture vanguard,"<ref name=YahooReview>{{cite news |title=Leighton Meester |work=[[Yahoo!]] |page= |date= |accessdate=July 9, 2009|url=http://tv.yahoo.com/leighton-meester/contributor/713039}}</ref> while Cecily von Ziegesar has called her a perfect choice.<ref>{{cite news |first=Jocelyn |last=Vena |coauthors= |title=''Gossip Girl'' Author Is A 'Faithful Watcher' Of The TV Series |work=[[MTV]] |page= |date=October 16, 2008 |accessdate=October 4, 2009 |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1597121/20081015/index.jhtml}}</ref>

In December 2010, Meester revealed plans to leave the show in 2012.

In {{nowrap|Season 1}} of ''Gossip Girl'', Blair is introduced as the Upper East Side's beautiful and popular queen bee. She is dating Nate Archibald, and is best friends with Serena van der Woodsen. She also finds a close companion in Nate's best friend and her childhood friend, Chuck Bass, who becomes a partner for her schemes. When Serena returns home from boarding school, Blair learns from Nate that he and a drunken Serena had slept together.<ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |coauthors= |title=''Gossip Girl'': "The Wild Bunch" |work=cwtv.com |page= |date= |accessdate=July 16, 2011 |url=http://www.cwtv.com/shows/gossip-girl/episodes/101}}</ref> Blair retaliates by publicly revealing Serena's connection to a rehab hospital.

After learning that Nate no longer loves her, Blair sleeps with Chuck, eventually falling for him. This leads to a heated affair and an eventual love triangle. Her inability to choose creates much of the first season's story line.<ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |coauthors= |title=''Gossip Girl'': "Hi, Society" |work=cwtv.com |page= |date= |accessdate=July 16, 2011 |url=http://www.cwtv.com/shows/gossip-girl/episodes/109}}</ref> She also begins a brief power struggle with freshman [[Jenny Humphrey]].

Amidst the fourth season, the romance between Dan and Blair became a polarizing topic among viewers<ref name=DB/> which also drew significant media interest. Jarett Wieselman of The ''[[New York Post]]'' applauded the development, feeling that Blair had "more chemistry" with Dan than with Chuck.<ref>{{cite news |first=Jarett |last=Wieselman |coauthors= |title=IM-ing about ''Gossip Girl'' |work=[[New York Post]] |page= |date=March 1, 2011 |accessdate=March 28, 2011 |url=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:_Tkv0BGTfpwJ:www.nypost.com/p/blogs/popwrap/im_ing_about_gossip_girl_rgTaVdXB87fbszlthtUVnM+http://www.nypost.com/p/blogs/popwrap/im_ing_about_gossip_girl_rgTaVdXB87fbszlthtUVnM&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us}}</ref> ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine's Chris Rovzar called Blair and Dan's story line "believable", citing their common ground in education and taste.

With regard to Chuck and Blair, Meester stated "I can really relate to it<U+2014>not necessarily because it's this dramatic, tumultuous relationship, but because the way they love each other is very real, and not for the sake of being dramatic. It's actual love. There's nobody for each other but them."<ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |coauthors= |title=Leighton Meester In ''Allure'' |work=[[The Huffington Post]] |page= |date=December 14, 2010 |accessdate=December 14, 2010 |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/12/14/leighton-meester-in-allur_n_796354.html}}</ref> Meester also expressed fondness for Dan and Blair, however, stating "I think they're good for each other in a lot of ways, in a way that Chuck and Blair aren't."<ref name=DB/>

Producers initially noticed chemistry between Blair and Dan in the {{nowrap|Season 1}} episode "Bad News Blair". According to producer Joshua Safran, the creators planned to revisit their relationship once the timing was right. Safran also stated that the outcome wasn't necessarily decided ahead of time. "One thing we are very conscious of<U+2014>and I know some fans get upset about this<U+2014>is we really try to treat the characters as living, breathing, well-rounded individuals. And we're often surprised by where their journeys take them; they open new doors for us all the time."<ref name=JS/>

====Controversy====
Following the {{nowrap|twenteith episode}} of {{nowrap|Season 4,}} Safran spoke on behalf of the series regarding the scene in which Chuck became violent with Blair.<ref>{{cite news |first=Jennifer |last=Arrow |coauthors= |title=''Gossip Girl'' Boss: "Chuck Has Never, and Will Never, Hurt Blair" |work=[[E!]] Online |page= |date=May 3, 2011 |accessdate=May 10, 2011 |url=http://www.eonline.com/uberblog/watch_with_kristin/b239902_gossip_girl_boss_chuck_has_never_will.html}}</ref>

{{cquote|The way we viewed it, I think it's very clear that Blair is not afraid in those moments, for herself. They have a volatile relationship, they always have, but I do not believe<U+2014>or I should say we do not believe<U+2014>that it is abuse when it's the two of them. Chuck does not try to hurt Blair. He punches the glass because he has rage, but he has never, and will never, hurt Blair. He knows it and she knows it, and I feel it's very important to know that she is not scared<U+2014>if anything, she is scared for Chuck<U+2014>and what he might do to himself, but she is never afraid of what he might do to her. Leighton and I were very clear about that.}}

In response to these comments, Carina MacKenzie of [[Zap2it]] stated "we're left wondering if Safran missed the part where she went home bleeding because Chuck was using physical intimidation to release his own emotions."<ref name=MacKenzie>{{cite news |first=Carina |last=MacKenzie |coauthors= |title=''Gossip Girl'': Is Chuck Bass abusive?

She noted Chuck's public humiliation of Blair, his attempt to pawn her during a business deal, and his use of physical intimidation. MacKenzie also called the show's explanation "disturbing, particularly given the young, female target demographic of ''Gossip Girl'' and The CW."<ref name=MacKenzie/>

In a review for the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', Judy Berman addressed Safran's description of Blair during the scene. "Considering how terrified Blair looked at the end of their encounter, and how quickly she got out of there, the show is sending a mixed message at best." She went on to state "we have no right to expect ''Gossip Girl'' to be a paragon of morality, or even realism, but the idea that true love requires taking a shard of glass to the face is disturbing even in this alternate, soap-opera dimension."<ref>{{cite news |first=Judy |last=Berman |coauthors= |title=''Gossip Girl'' recap: They tried to make Chuck go to rehab |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |page= |date=May 10, 2011 |accessdate=May 10, 2011 |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/showtracker/2011/05/gossip-girl-recap-they-tried-to-make-chuck-go-to-rehab.html}}</ref>

==Reception==
===Novel series===
While covering the book series, Janet Malcolm of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' labeled the character "an [[antihero]]ine of the first rank," and asserted that "the series belongs to awful Blair, who inspires von Ziegesar's highest flights of comic fancy." She also compared Blair to vintage film and literary figures such as [[Becky Sharp (character)|Becky Sharp]] of ''[[Vanity Fair (novel)|Vanity Fair]]'', and Lizzie Eustace of ''[[The Eustace Diamonds]]''.<ref name=NYreview/> In addition, the character has drawn comparisons to notable contemporaries, including Lila Fowler of the ''[[Sweet Valley High]]'' series.<ref>{{cite news |first=Amelia |last=McDonell-Parry |coauthors= |title=Casting The ''Sweet Valley High'' Movie |work=thefrisky.com |page= |date=September 24, 2009 |accessdate=October 3, 2009 |url=http://www.thefrisky.com/post/246-casting-the-sweet-valley-high-movie/}}</ref> 

In the 2007 book ''Children's Literature and Culture'', writer Harry Edwin Eiss chastised the depiction of Blair's bulimia. "If handled properly, the inclusion of her illness could have provided a powerful lesson for young adult readers who worry about their weight and food consumption. Unfortunately, Cecily von Ziegesar, the author of the series, presents a seriously flawed treatment of the problem. In a failed attempt at humor, the writer regards Blair's sickness as just another source of gossip."<ref>{{cite news |first=Harry |last=Eiss |coauthors= |title=''Children's Literature and Culture'' |work=Cambridge Scholars Publishing |page=133 |year=2007 |accessdate=July 12, 2011 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=xqYpAQAAIAAJ&dq=Children%27s+literature+and+culture&q=blair+waldorf+bulimic}}</ref> Emily Nussbaum of ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine had similar comments, calling the bulimia "more of an icky weakness than a full-fledged pathology."
