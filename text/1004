'''Martie Maguire''' is an [[United States|American]] [[songwriter]], [[singer]], [[multi-instrumentalist]], and a founding member of the female [[alternative country]] [[band (music)|band]], [[Dixie Chicks]]. She won awards in national fiddle championships while still a teenager.  Maguire is accomplished on  several other instruments, including the mandolin, viola, acoustic bass, and guitar. She has written and co-written a number of the band's songs, some of which have become chart-topping hits. She also contributes her skills in vocal harmony and backing vocals, as well as orchestrating string arrangements for the band.

Maguire learned several instruments at a young age, honing her skills with her sister, [[Emily Robison]] (ne<U+00E9> [[Emily Erwin]]), by playing together with two other schoolmates for over five years as a part of a high school touring bluegrass quartet. After graduation, the sisters forged an alliance with two other women they had met through the Dallas music scene, [[Laura Lynch]] and [[Robin Lynn Macy]], forming a bluegrass and country music band, busking and touring the bluegrass festival circuits for six years.  After the departure of Macy, and the replacement of Lynch with singer-songwriter [[Natalie Maines]], the band widened their musical repertoire and appearance.  The result was a trio so commercially successful that it took the country music industry by surprise, with a number of hit songs, albums, and awards that has set records.  Maguire subsequently stood by her bandmates as they were engulfed in political controversy.

== Early life ==
'''Martha Elenor Erwin''' (nicknamed "'''Martie'''") was born [[October 12]] [[1969]], in [[York, Pennsylvania]],<ref name="TV guide"> [http://www.tvguide.com/celebrities/martie-maguire/256027 TV Guide]</ref> but was raised in [[Addison, Texas|Addison]], a northern suburban town on the edge of [[Dallas, Texas]], with an older sister, Julia, and younger sister, Emily, to parents Paul Erwin and Barbara Trask. Encouraged by her parents- both educators at private schools - Maguire began playing [[Classical music|classical violin]] [[violin]] at age five, and by age 12, was learning to play "[[fiddle]] style", with a birthday gift of fiddle lessons, <ref name="''Ladies Home Journal''"> [http://www.lhj.com/lhj/story.jhtml?storyid=/templatedata/lhj/story/data/martiemaguirecelebprofile_01132003.xml Ladies' Home Journal](Retrieved 13 March, 2008)</ref> and was active in her school orchestra.<ref name="Gilchriest"> Gilchriest, Gail [http://www.freewebs.com/originalchicks/newsarchive.htm  The Dixie Chicks Put Cowgirl Chic Back in the Saddle  Elle Magazine 1991]</ref> [[Emily Erwin]], (later known as [[Emily Robison]]), three years her junior, also shared an early talent, interest and love of music, and the two were provided musical instruction on several instruments.  Because of this, although Maguire became famous for her ability in [[vocal harmony]], and mastery of the fiddle, she also plays a variety of [[stringed instruments]] that include the [[viola]], [[guitar]], [[mandolin]], and [[upright bass|bass]].<ref name=Leggett> Leggett, Steve [http://music.msn.com/artist/?artist=16649328&menu=bio All-Music Guide writer on MSN] (Retrieved 9 March, 2008)</ref>

By 1983, Maguire was touring with her sister Emily and school friends; siblings Troy and [[Sharon Gilchrist]].<ref name="JamBase"> [http://www.jambase.com/Artists/Bio.aspx?ArtistID=29795 Jam Base Sharon Gilchrist]</ref>  The sisters showed an "almost obsessive" interest in [[busking]] at small venues and attending bluegrass festivals.<ref name="Frost"> Frost, Jane [http://www.dixie-chicks.com/stories.shtml Walnut Valley Festival in Winfield, KS, Early 1980s The All-Inclusive Dixie Chicks Page]</ref> The four students formed the teenage [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] group "Blue Night Express", playing together for 5 years, from 1984-1989,<ref name="Faraway Hills">  Gilchrist, Sharon[http://homepage.ntlworld.com/farawayhills/sharon_gilchrist.html  Faraway Hills Retrieved 12 February, 2008]</ref> while still attending private [[Greenhill School (Addison, Texas)]].<ref name=Leggett/> "We'd drive down to the west end of Dallas and open our cases, and that was our job," Maguire said of it in a later interview to [[60 Minutes II]] [[correspondent]] [[Dan Rather]].

After graduation of high school, with Robison yet to complete her secondary school studies, from 1988 to 1989, Maguire attended [[Southwestern University]] in [[Georgetown, Texas]], performing in the school orchestra there and again in the National fiddle championships, earning third place that year.<ref name="Walnut Valley Association">[http://www.wvfest.com/ Walnut Valley Association 1987 and 1989 National fiddle championships in archive Retrieved 2 March, 2008]</ref>

== With the Dixie Chicks ==
In 1989, Maguire and Robison joined [[guitarist]] [[Robin Lynn Macy]] and [[Laura Lynch]] on [[Upright bass|bass]] in the [[Dixie Chicks]], playing what was at the time predominantly [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] music and a mix of [[country music|country]] standards. Originally listed as Martha, and then Martie Erwin, Maguire played [[fiddle]], [[mandolin]], [[viola]] and [[harmonized]] with Robison on [[backing vocals]] within the band.<ref name="Superior"> [http://www.superiorpics.com/martie_maguire/ Superior Pics Retrieved 23 March, 2008]</ref>

Maguire had begun writing and recording songs on their debut independent album, ''[[Thank Heavens for Dale Evans]]''; and in 2001, one song, co-written with Laura Lynch called "Pink Toenails" resurfaced.  The song was featured in the film, ''[[Don't Say A Word]]'', with [[Skye McCole Bartusiak]] performing the  number.<ref name="Yahoo review"> (Retrieved 22 March, 2008)[http://movies.yahoo.com/movie/1807438736/cast#Music Yahoo Movie Review for Don't Say a Word]</ref> 

When their second album had a more polished sound, Maguire commented, "I hope our fans won't be disappointed [in ''The Little Ol' Cowgirl'']; it's got drums on every track; it's no longer [[bluegrass (music)|bluegrass]], but we have to make a living and you can't do that playing bluegrass."<ref name="Clark"> Clark, Renee [http://www.dixie-chicks.com/dlife392.shtml Can the Dixie Chicks make it in the big time? Local Heroes  (Transcribed from) ''Dallas Life Magazine'', ''Dallas Morning News'', March 1, 1992](Retrieved 23 January, 2008)</ref>

Two albums later, after [[Natalie Maines]] assumed the position of lead vocalist, the band was revitalized.  Maguire said of their music, "It's very rootsy, but then Natalie comes in with a rock and blues influence. That gave Emily and I a chance to branch out, because we loved those kinds of music but felt limited by our instruments."<ref name="Malkin">  [http://chickoholic.tripod.com/DixieChicks/id8.html Malkin, Nina]</ref> 

Maguire co-wrote the song, "[[Cowboy Take Me Away]]", recorded on the current Dixie Chicks sophomore studio album ''[[Fly (Dixie Chicks album)|Fly]]'' for her sister Emily, during her [[courtship]] to [[country music]] [[singer]] [[Charlie Robison]].<ref name="''Ladies Home Journal''" />   Maguire was singled out by [[Broadcast Music, Incorporated|BMI]] in 2000, and awarded Songwriter of the Year for  writing and/or co-writing "[[Cowboy Take Me Away]]", "Ready To Run" and "[[You Were Mine]]"; the last being co-written with Robison, about their parent's divorce.<ref name="Hillman"> Hillman, Chris [http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,84675,00.html Entertainment Weekly] (Retrieved 21 April, 2008)</ref>

In 1999, the Dixie Chicks performed two songs, recording a [[Cover song|cover]] of the song, [[You Can't Hurry Love]] as well as Maguire's "[[Ready to Run]]" for the film [[Runaway Bride]], starring [[Richard Gere]] and [[Julia Roberts]].<ref name="Lyrics"> [http://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/runaway_bride_soundtrack/  Lyrics to Runaway Bride Soundtrack]</ref>  In 2003, Maguire was [[Nominate|nominated]] for a [[Tony Award]] for co-composing the [[film score]] to ''[[Urban Cowboy (musical)|Urban Cowboy]]''; the musical, using the song she had co-written, "Cowboy Take Me Away".<ref name="Frontpage Publicity"> [http://www.frontpagepublicity.com/dxc/content/careeroverview.html Dixie Chicks website] (Retrieved 9 March, 2008)</ref> In addition, Maguire played fiddle on the song, " Somewhere Down The Road" on [[Deryl Dodd]]'s debut album.

After the band achieved massive commercial success with its first two albums with Maines, they struggled with their record company over artistic direction on the third.  Maguire commented, "I don't think any of us ever trusted Nashville. When you're in that town you know everybody is talking about everybody else. Everybody is wishing for the other guy to fail."<ref name=" Flippo"> Martie Maguire, to ''[[The Los Angeles Times]]'', 5/21/06. Flippo, Chet (May 25, 2006) [http://www.cmt.com/news/nashville-skyline/1532532/nashville-skyline-dixie-chicks-dixie-chicks-dixie-chicks.jhtml  CMT News Nashville Skyline: Dixie Chicks, Dixie Chicks, Dixie Chicks] </ref>

Although Maguire and Robison often appear quiet and demure compared to their animated bandmate Natalie Maines, the trio have stood united on controversial subjects since they banded together to play in 1995, even when their opinions have had the potential to serve them more harm than good. In 2006, Maguire said, "I'd rather have a smaller following of really cool people who get it, who will grow with us as we grow and are fans for life, than people that have us in their five-disc changer with [[Reba McEntire]] and [[Toby Keith]]. We don't want those kinds of fans. They limit what you can do."<ref name="Tryangiel">{{cite news | author=Tryangiel, Josh |url=http://www.time.com/time/archive/preview/0,10987,1196419,00.html |title=In The Line of Fire|date=May 29, 2006|publisher=[[Time Magazine]]}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Martie married [[pharmaceutical]] [[sales representative|representative]] Ted Seidel on [[June 17]], [[1995]], and changed her surname to his, becoming [[Martie Seidel]], as well as the stepmother to his son, Carter. [[Brad Paisley]] emerged as a new country music singer who co-wrote a song about child watching as his mother kept being rejected by her dates because she had a child, and the gratitude the boy felt to the man who was able to care for them both.  Martie wrote to tell him she was moved both because she was now a stepmother, and had a stepfather as well. The song was called,"[[He Didn't Have to Be]]," and Maguire joined him in performing it onstage in a concert on a [[CMT]] showcase program, "[[On The Verge]]", saying the song "struck a chord" in her".<ref name="Paisley"> Paisley, Brad [http://www.chicksrockchicksrule.com/video.htm  "He Didn't Have To Be" (Retrieved 20 January, 2008)]</ref>  However, her marriage did not last, and she and Ted Seidel were divorced in November, 1999.<ref name="''Ladies Home Journal''"/>

At bandmate [[Natalie Maines]]' sister Kim's wedding Martie met Gareth Maguire, a [[Roman Catholic]] teacher and actor from [[Northern Ireland]]. The couple became engaged in June, 2001, and married [[August 10]], [[2001]], in a civil ceremony in [[Hawaii]]. Later they had a Catholic "blessing" ceremony in the groom's hometown, [[Carnlough]] in [[County Antrim]], [[Ireland]], on [[March 9]], [[2002]], for all the guests that were not able to attend the first wedding. She said of the ceremony that the [[Catholic Church]] would not permit a wedding service due to her prior divorce.  Maguire says ruefully that there were so many "special" people that they'd wanted to include, but that they just couldn't wait to marry.<ref name="CMT Online"> CMT Online, [http://www.cmt.com/artists/news/1449170/09252001/dixie_chicks.jhtml CMT Online  (Retrieved 25 September, 2005)]</ref> Part of the reason for the rush was Gareth's need to keep flying back and forth because of visa considerations. <ref name="Minchin"> Minchin III, James R. and Lieberman, Ellen InStyle Magazine; February 2003, Vol. 10 Issue 2, pg. 244  Retrieved 25 September 2005]</ref>
After her marriage, Martie changed her name to that of her new husband, which is why in her musical career she has had the [[surnames]] of Erwin, Seidel, and now, Maguire.

In a strange turn of fate, all three bandmates are [[Relatives|related]]. Because Martie and Emily are sisters, and Natalie Maines' sister Kim Maines married Shane Maguire, who is the brother of Gareth Maguire, Martie's husband, Natalie became [[sister-in-law]] by marriage to Martie.

Martie and Gareth have three daughters: [[fraternal twins]] Eva Ruth and Kathleen 'Katie' Emilie, born [[April 27]], [[2004]], and third daughter, Harper Rosie Maguire, born [[July 25]], [[2008]]. 

Maguire has been frank about using [[invitro fertilization]] to conceive their twins. In an interview in ''[[Conceive Magazine]]'', she said, "All my paperwork said 'unspecified origin'.  We spent three years of active trying before we went to IVF. First I went on [[Clomid]]. Then I had some dye tests and found I had a collapsed tube, so I had [[laparoscopic surgery]]; the tube wasn't blocked, just spasming."  After three attempts at [[intrauterine insemination]], she said, she and her husband didn't think it was worth continuing in that manner, and switched to [[IVF]].<ref name="common1">{{cite web|url=http://www.conceiveonline.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=71&Itemid=22|title=The Dixie Chicks: Taking the Long Way... to Motherhood|last=Weinhouse,|first=Beth|date=Fall 2007    |publisher=Conceive Magazine Online|accessdate=2008-07-27|Weinhouse}}</ref>  In August 2007, Maguire began IVF again, resulting in their third daughter Harper. 

Regarding the number of children the Dixie Chicks have produced in the past seven years, (Maines has two and Robison has three in addition to Maguire's twins and newborn) Maguire told ''[[People Magazine]]'', "We'll have to move over and let the little chicks take over! We've got a new band!"<ref name="People"> ''People Magazine'' (accessed 28 January, 2008)[http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20174066,00.html  Dixie Chick Martie Maguire Is Expecting]</ref>

Maguire and Robison co-wrote a song, "So Hard", about their own personal experiences with infertility and their need to rely on other methods to conceive. They speak out about the difficulties they faced, but also their good fortune; both having options that for many women are financially prohibitive. Mentioning the [[stigma]] attached to IVF, Magurie said, "I think we feel a responsibility to break down some barriers. It's much more of a common problem than people realize."<ref name="FrontpagePublicity"> Frontpage Publicity [http://www.frontpagepublicity.com/dxc/bio.html  Dixie Chicks Website]</ref> A final concern Maguire mentioned was the question of what to do with all the unused frozen [[embryos]]. "Now that I have children, I see those embryos as possible children. So I have to think about what my options are if there are leftovers again. I could keep them in storage, and maybe they will help my 
children some day. Or I can try to donate them to [[stem cell research]]. I don't think I could give them to another family," she admits. "I would always worry: what if it's an abusive family? What if they don't get enough love?"<ref name="common1"/>
