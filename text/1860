The '''Litchfield and Madison Railway''' {{reporting mark|LM}} was a [[Class I railroad]] in [[Illinois]] in the [[United States]].  Its nickname was the '''St. Louis Gateway Route'''.  The railroad operated {{convert|44|mi}} of track from its creation in 1900 until it was absorbed by the [[Chicago and North Western Railway]] in 1958.

== History ==

In 1889-1890, the [[Chicago, Peoria and St. Louis Railroad]] began constructing a railroad line at [[Winston, Illinois]], about a mile from [[Litchfield, Illinois]], with the intent of the line eventually reaching [[Madison, Illinois]].<ref name=CNWHS>{{cite web| url=http://www.cnwhs.org/ch_lm.htm| title=Litchfield & Madison - A Capsule History| publisher=Chicago & North Western Historical Society| year=2004| }}</ref>  At the same time, another railroad, called the St. Louis and Eastern, began building a line from [[Litchfield, Illinois]] to [[Glen Carbon, Illinois]], also with the goal of the line extending to [[Madison, Illinois]].<ref name=CNWHS />  Sometime in the 1890s, the Chicago, Peoria and St. Louis struck an accord to lease some unbuilt right-of-way from the St. Louis and Eastern.  Both lines eventually extended into Madison.<ref name=CNWHS />

The Litchfield and Madison was incorporated on March 1, 1900 by James Duncan to take over an isolated line of the [[Chicago, Peoria and St. Louis Railroad]] between [[Litchfield, Illinois]] and [[Madison, Illinois]].<ref name=railroadsL-O>{{cite web| url=http://www.trains.com/ctr/default.aspx?c=a&id=60| publisher=Kalmbach Publishing| work=Classic Trains Magazine| title=Railroad Fallen Flags: L-O| date=June 26, 2006| }}</ref><ref name=CNWHS />  At that time, Duncan also took over the Chicago, Peoria and St. Louis.<ref name=CNWHS />  In 1926, the L&M constructed a connection to the Chicago and North Western at [[Benld, Illinois]].<ref name=railroadsL-O />  The railroad served as the entry to [[East St. Louis, Illinois]] for both the Chicago and North Western and the [[Illinois Central Railroad]].<ref name=railroadsL-O />  In addition, in the 1925-1926 time frame, the C&NW obtained trackage rights over the L&M from Benld to East St. Louis.  At the same time, the L&M received minor reciprocal trackage rights over the C&NW.<ref name=CNWHS />

During its life, the L&M was known for being both a bridge railroad and also a hauler of coal.<ref name="grant"> {{cite book |last=Grant |first=H. Roger |authorlink = H. Roger |origyear=1996 |title=The North Western: A History of the Chicago and North Western Railway System |publisher=[[Northern Illinois University Press]] |id=ISBN 9780875802145 |page=207 |accessdate=}}</ref>  Most of the coal consisted of loads brought southbound to the St. Louis area from mines in the area.<ref name=CNWHS />

It is not clear if the L&M ever operated passenger service.  The railroad's physical plant did include a depot and office at [[Staunton, Illinois]], suggesting that passenger service may well have been operated at one time.<ref name=CNWHS />

Apart from the C&NW, the L&M also connected with the [[Illinois Central Railroad]], the [[New York, Chicago and St. Louis Railroad]] in East St. Louis, the [[Alton and Southern Railway]], the [[Illinois Terminal Railroad]], the [[Southern Railway (U.S.)|Southern Railway]], the [[Terminal Railroad Association of St. Louis]] and the [[Wabash Railroad]].<ref name=CNWHS />

The railroad was headquartered in [[Edwardsville, Illinois]].<ref name=CNWHS />

== Motive power ==

During the steam era, the L&M operated [[2-8-0]] steam locomotives (also known as Consolidations) and [[2-8-2]] steam locomotives (also known as Mikados or Mikes).<ref name=Trains>{{cite journal| journal=[[Trains (magazine)|Trains]]| month=May| year=1974| page=p. 43| }}</ref>  In the early diesel era, the L&M operated one [[Baldwin VO-1000]] and three [[ALCO RS-3]]s.<ref name=CNWHS /><ref name=Trains />

== Merger into the Chicago and North Western ==

On August 1, 1957, lawyers for the Chicago and North Western filed paperwork to acquire the Litchfield and Madison outright.  The [[Interstate Commerce Commission]] quickly granted the C&NW's application.<ref name="grant"> {{cite book |last=Grant |first=H. Roger |authorlink = H.

The Litchfield and Madison was formally merged into the Chicago and North Western on January 2, 1958.<ref name=railroadsL-O />
