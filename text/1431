The '''law school of Beirut''' (also known as the '''law school of Berytus''' and the '''school of Roman law at Berytus''') was a center for the study of [[Roman law]] in [[classical antiquity]] located in [[Beirut]]. It flourished under the patronage of the [[Roman emperor]]s and functioned as the [[Roman Empire]]'s preeminent center of jurisprudence until its destruction in 551&nbsp;CE.

The law schools of the Roman Empire established organized repositories of imperial constitutions and institutionalized the study and practice of jurisprudence to relieve the busy imperial courts. The archiving of imperial constitutions facilitated the task of [[jurist]]s in referring to legal precedents. The origins of the law school of Beirut are obscure. The earliest written mention of the school dates to 239&nbsp;CE, when its reputation had already been established. The school attracted young, affluent Roman citizens, and its professors made major contributions to the [[Corpus Juris Civilis|Codex of Justinian]]. The school achieved such wide recognition throughout the Empire that Beirut was known as the "Mother of Laws". Beirut was one of the few schools allowed to continue teaching jurisprudence when [[List of Byzantine emperors|Byzantine emperor]] [[Justinian I]] shut down other provincial law schools.

The course of study at Beirut lasted for five years and consisted in the revision and analysis of classical juridic texts and imperial constitutions, in addition to case discussions. Justinian took a personal interest in the teaching process, charging the bishop of Beirut, the governor of [[Phoenicia|Phoenicia Maritima]] and the teachers with discipline maintenance in the school.

The school's facilities were destroyed in the aftermath of a [[551 Beirut earthquake|massive earthquake]] that hit the Phoenician coastline. It was moved to [[Sidon]] but did not survive the [[Muslim conquest of the Levant|Arab conquest]] of 635&nbsp;CE. Ancient texts attest that the school was located next to the ancient Anastasis church, vestiges of which lie beneath the [[Saint George Greek Orthodox Cathedral]] in [[Beirut Central District|Beirut's historic center]].

==Background==
As the guarantor of justice, the [[Roman emperor]] was expected to devote substantial amounts of time to judicial matters. He was the [[Executive magistrates of the Roman Empire|chief magistrate]] whose major prerogative (''[[Ius|jus]]'') was the ordering of all public affairs, for which he could demand assistance from anyone at any time.<ref name="Walker 2000 91">Walker 2000, p. 91</ref>

With legal appeals, petitions from subjects and judicial queries of magistrates and [[Roman governor|governors]], the emperors were careful to consult with the [[jurist]]s (''iuris consulti''), who were usually secretaries drafted from the [[Roman equestrian order|equestrian order]]. From the reign of [[Augustus]] (27&nbsp;BCE<U+2013>14&nbsp;CE), jurists began compiling organized repositories of imperial [[edict]]s (''constitutiones''), and juristic scholarship became an imperially sponsored function of administration. Every new judicial decision was founded on archived [[Precedent|legal precedents]] and earlier deliberations. The edict repositories and the imperially sponsored juristic scholarship gave rise to the earliest law school system of the [[Western world]], aimed specifically at training professional jurists.<ref name="Walker 2000 91"/>

==History==
During the reign of Augustus, [[Beirut]] was established under the name ''Colonia Iulia Augusta Felix Berytus''<ref group=lower-alpha> Named after Augustus' daughter [[Julia the Elder]].</ref><ref>Charnock 1859, p. 36</ref> (and granted the status of ''[[Ius Italicum]]'') as a [[Colonia (Roman)|colony]] for [[Battle of Actium]] veterans from the fifth Macedonian and the third Gallic legions. It was chosen as a regional center instead of the more prominent Phoenician cities of [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] and [[Sidon]], which had a history of belligerence against Rome.<ref>Jones Hall 2004, pp. 46<U+2013>47</ref><ref name="arc">{{cite journal | url=http://archive.archaeology.org/1107/features/beirut_lebanon_urban_archaeology.html | title=Rebuilding Beirut |author=Lawler, Andrew | journal=Archaeology | year=2011 | month=July<U+2013>August | volume=64 | issue=4}}</ref>

[[File:St. George's Cathedral, Beirut.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A large church at the edge of an archaeological field.|St. George's Cathedral sits on the axis of Beirut's ancient [[Cardo|Cardo Maximus]]. The law school used to be located next to the Byzantine Anastasis church, a precursor of the cathedral.]]
Beirut was first mentioned in writing as a major center for the study of law in the 239&nbsp;CE works of [[Gregory Thaumaturgus]], the bishop of [[Niksar|Neo-Caesarea]].<ref>Sartre 2005, p. 289</ref><ref>Collinet 1925, p. 17</ref><ref>Thaumaturgus 239, pp. 45<U+2013>46</ref> Other early written sources do not mention when the law school was established, and the date is much debated among [[Modern history|modern historians]] and scholars. [[Edward Gibbon]] suggested its founding may have been directed by locally born Emperor [[Alexander Severus]], who reigned during 222<U+2013>235&nbsp;CE;<ref>Gibbon 1854, p. 294</ref> this hypothesis had been supported by [[Gilles M<U+00E9>nage]], a late seventeenth-century French scholar. Italian jurist [[Scipione Gentili]], however, attributed the school's foundation to Augustus, while nineteenth-century German theologian [[Karl Hase]] advocated its establishment shortly after the victory at Actium (31&nbsp;BCE).<ref>Collinet 1925, pp. 16<U+2013>20</ref> Adolf Friedrich Rudorff dated it to the reign of [[Hadrian]],<ref>Rudorff  1857, p. 130</ref> while Franz Peter Bremer suggested that it opened around 200&nbsp;CE, based on Thaumaturgus.<ref>Bremer 1868, p. 73</ref>

[[Theodor Mommsen]] linked the establishment of the law school in Beirut with the need for jurists, since the city was chosen to serve as a repository for Roman imperial edicts concerning the eastern provinces. After arriving in Beirut, these were translated into [[Ancient Greek|Greek]], [[publishing|published]] and archived. This function was first recorded in 196&nbsp;CE, the date of the earliest constitutions contained in the [[Codex Gregorianus|Gregorian Codex]], but the city is thought to have served as a repository since earlier times.<ref>Mommsen 1901, pp. 139<U+2013>144</ref><ref name="Kassir 2010, p. 52">Kassir 2010, p. 52</ref> The proximity of the repository to the law school allowed the Beiruti jurists to consult archived documents and for students to learn of the most recent imperial decrees<U+2014>an advantage that the law schools of [[Caesarea Maritima]] and [[Alexandria]] lacked.<ref>Collinet 1925, p. 22</ref>

The third-century emperors [[Diocletian]] and [[Maximian]] issued constitutions exempting the students of the law school of Beirut from compulsory service in their hometowns.<ref>Collinet 1925, pp. 29<U+2013>30</ref><ref>Jidejian 1973, p. 65</ref> In the fourth century, the Greek [[rhetoric]]ian [[Libanius]] reported that the school attracted young students from affluent families and deplored the school's instructional use of [[Latin]], which was gradually abandoned in favor of Greek in the course of the century.<ref name="Collinet 1925, p. 39">Collinet 1925, p. 39</ref><ref name="Clark 2011, p. 36">Clark 2011, p. 36</ref><ref name="Rochette 1997 pp. 168, 174">Rochette 1997 pp. 168, 174</ref>
By the fifth century, Beirut had established its leading position and repute among the Empire's law schools; its teachers were highly regarded and played a chief role in the development of juristic learning in the East to the point that they were dubbed "Oecumenical Masters".<ref name="Jolowicz 1972, p. 453">Jolowicz 1972, p. 453</ref><ref>Pomeroy 2012, pp. 41<U+2013>42</ref> From 425&nbsp;CE, the law school of [[Constantinople]] became a rival center of law study and was the only school, along with Beirut's, to be maintained after [[Justinian I]] closed those of Alexandria, Caesarea Maritima and [[Athens]] in 529&nbsp;CE<ref name="Jolowicz 1972, p. 453"/> because their teachings contradicted with Christian faith.<ref>Riddle 2008, p. 107</ref>

On July 9, 551, the Phoenician coastal cities were devastated by a high magnitude earthquake. In Beirut the earthquake was followed by a [[tsunami]] and a fire that obliterated the city. In the aftermath, 30,000 people lost their lives, including many students from abroad. Justinian allocated funds to rebuild Beirut, and the law school was temporarily moved to the southern Phoenician city of Sidon, pending reconstruction; the best teachers, however, moved to Constantinople. Misfortune hit Beirut again in 560&nbsp;CE when a massive fire ravaged the recovering city. The law school was not reopened, and all prospect for its return was abandoned with the [[Muslim conquest of the Levant|Arab conquest]] in 635&nbsp;CE.<ref>Collinet 1925, pp. 54<U+2013>58</ref><ref name="Sartre 2005, p. 291">Sartre 2005, p. 291</ref>

==Academia==
The study course at the law school of Beirut was restricted to [[Roman law]]; it did not cover the local laws of the province of Phoenicia.<ref>Collinet 1925, p. 209</ref> Ancient texts provide an idea of the curriculum, the teaching method, the course languages and its duration.

===Preparatory studies===
Potential students were expected to have undergone grammar, rhetoric and encyclopedic sciences studies. Another prerequisite was the mastery of Greek and Latin, given that the classical juridic references and imperial constitutions used in the teaching program were written in Latin. The aspirants could pursue their preparatory studies in public schools or have private tutors.<ref>Collinet 1925, pp. 81<U+2013>83</ref>

===Curriculum===
[[File:Meister von San Vitale in Ravenna 004.jpg|thumbnail|alt=Mosaic depicting the bust of a severe-looking man wearing a crown and an intricate royal purple tunic.|[[Justinian I]], the emperor who instigated the rewriting of Roman law]]
Little is known about the Beirut law school's curriculum before the fifth century. The ''[[Scholia Sinaitica]]'' and the ''[[Scholia]]'' to the ''[[Basilika|Basilica]]'' provide glimpses of the school's [[teaching method]], comparable to the method of rhetoric schools at the time. The lecturer would discuss and analyze juridic texts by adding his own comments, which included references to analogous passages from imperial constitutions or from the works of prominent classical Roman jurists, such as [[Ulpian]]. He would then formulate the general legal principles and use these to resolve legal problems inspired from actual, practical cases. This method differed from the scheme of classical times in which the student had to master the law basics before engaging in case studies.<ref name="Jolowicz 1972, p. 454">Jolowicz 1972, p. 454</ref><ref name="Mousourakis 2003, p. 363">Mousourakis 2003, p. 363</ref><ref>Collinet 1925, p. 245</ref>

Jurisprudence was taught in Latin, even in the law schools of the East, but toward the end of the fourth and the beginning of the fifth century, Latin was supplanted by Greek at Beirut,<ref name="Collinet 1925, p. 39"/><ref name="Jolowicz 1972, p. 454"/> which was the long-established [[lingua franca]] of the eastern territories of the Roman Empire.<ref>Horrocks 2009, p. 126</ref> A similar shift probably occurred at the school of Constantinople at about the same time.<ref name="Collinet 1925, p. 39"/><ref name="Jolowicz 1972, p. 454"/>

The ''Omnem'' constitution at the beginning of the [[Digest (Roman law)|Digest]] is the only source of information about the existing study system in the fifth century until the Justinian reforms of 533&nbsp;CE. The old program was a four-year course to be completed before the age of 25. The courses were based on the works of [[Gaius (jurist)|Gaius]], Ulpian, [[Aemilius Papinianus|Papinian]] and [[Julius Paulus Prudentissimus|Paulus]]. Students attended lectures for three years and spent the fourth year in private study of Paulus' ''[[Responsa]]''; they had the option to stay for a fifth year to study imperial constitutions. The students of each year were distinguished by special nicknames: first year, ''Dupondii''; second, ''Edictales''; third, ''Papinianistae''; fourth, ''Lytae''.<ref>Collinet 1925, pp. 224<U+2013>240</ref><ref>Sheppard 1999, p. 295</ref>

Justinian's ''Omnem'' constitution fixed the duration of the legal course in the schools of Beirut and Constantinople at five years.<ref name="Corcoran">{{cite web | url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/history2/volterra/julianintro.htm | title=Law-school texts after 533 | publisher=University College London | work=The Epitome of Julian | date=July 20, 2009 | accessdate=March 23, 2013 |author=Corcoran, Simon|authorlink=Simon Corcoran}}</ref><ref name="digest">Monro 1872, pp. XVIII<U+2013>XXIV</ref> The courses consisted of lectures and self-study using materials advanced in his ''[[Corpus Juris Civilis]]'', namely the ''[[Institutes of Justinian|Institutiones]]'' (Institutes), ''[[Digest (Roman law)|Digesta]]'' (Digest) and ''[[Codex Justinianus|Codex]]'' (Code).<ref name="Corcoran"/><ref name="digest"/> First-year students were lectured on the Institutes and on the first part of the Digest;<ref group=lower-alpha>Books 1<U+2013>4 of the Digest are called the ''Prota''.</ref> second-year students were taught the greater part of the Digest,<ref group=lower-alpha>The ''de iudiciis'' (books 5<U+2013>11), the ''de rebus'' (books 12<U+2013>19) and  the ''libri singularis'' (books 23, 26, 28 and 30).</ref> and third-year students had to learn various texts from Papinian and the ''leges singulares''.<ref group=lower-alpha>Books 20<U+2013>22.</ref> There were no lectures during the course's fourth year but the pupils studied the remainder of the Digest.<ref group=lower-alpha>Books 24, 25, 27, 29 and 31<U+2013>36.</ref> Nicknames were still given according to the year of study, but Justinian changed the name of first-year students from the frivolous ''Dupondii'' (which means "two pennies") to ''Iustiniani novi'' and dubbed fifth-year students ''Prolytae''.<ref>Collinet 1925, p. 241</ref><ref>Buckland 1921, p. 49</ref>
At the end of the course, graduands were given certificates allowing them to work as court advocates or in the imperial civil service.<ref name="Mousourakis 2003, p. 363"/>

===Professorial body===
Ancient texts reveal the names and deeds of some of the most notable law professors at the Beirut school. The scarce sources include historical accounts, juridic works, anthologies, ancient correspondences and funerary inscriptions.

[[Antioch]]-based rhetoric teacher Libanius wrote many letters of correspondence to Domninus the Elder, a fourth-century law school professor. In 360&nbsp;CE, Libanius invited Domninus to leave Beirut and teach with him at the rhetoric school of Antioch. Domninus apparently declined the offer, since later correspondence to him from Libanius, between 361 and 364&nbsp;CE, served as recommendations for law school candidates.<ref>Collinet 1925, p. 121</ref>

The most brilliant era of Beirut's law school, spanning the century between 400 and 500&nbsp;CE, was known as the era of the "Ecumenical Masters" (Greek: <U+03C4><U+1FC6><U+03C2> <U+03BF><U+1F30><U+03BA><U+03BF><U+03C5><U+03BC><U+03AD><U+03BD><U+03B7><U+03C2> <U+03B4><U+03B9><U+03B4><U+03AC><U+03C3><U+03BA><U+03B1><U+03BB><U+03BF><U+03B9>). During this period, a succession of seven highly esteemed law masters was largely responsible for the revival of legal education in the [[Eastern Roman Empire]].<ref name="Jolowicz 1972, p. 453"/><ref name="Collinet 1925 131">Collinet 1925, p. 131</ref> The seven revered masters, cited with praise by sixth-century scholars, were [[Cyrillus]], [[Patricius (jurist)|Patricius]], [[Domninus (jurist)|Domninus]], [[Demosthenes (jurist)|Demosthenes]], [[Eudoxius (jurist)|Eudoxius]], [[Leontius (jurist)|Leontius]] and [[Amblichus]].<ref name="Collinet 1925 131"/>

Cyrillus was the founder of the ecumenical school of jurists.<ref name="Kassir 2010, p. 52"/> He is believed to have taught as of {{c.|400}} or {{c.|410}}&nbsp;CE. Styled "the great" due to his reputation as a teacher, he was known for his direct use of ancient sources of law and for interpreting jurists such as Ulpian and Papinian. Cyrillus wrote a precise treatise on definitions that supplied the materials for many important ''scholia'' appended to the first and second titles of the eleventh book of the ''Basilica''.<ref>Encyclopedia Britannica 1911, p. 707</ref><ref>Collinet 1925, pp. 131<U+2013>132</ref>
Patricius was praised in the third preface of the Justinian Digest (''Tanta-Dedoken'') as a distinguished professor of the Beirut law school. Archaeological excavations done in Beirut at the turn of the twentieth century revealed a funerary monument believed to have belonged to Patricius.<ref>Jalabert 1906, pp. 170<U+2013>171</ref><ref>Collinet 1925, pp. 132<U+2013>138</ref> The son of Eudoxius, Leontius was described by ecclesiastical historian [[Zacharias Rhetor]], who was his first-year student in 487 or 488&nbsp;CE, to have a great reputation in the legal field. He was raised to the office of [[Praetorian prefecture of the East|Praetorian prefect of the East]] under Emperor [[Anastasius I Dicorus|Anastasius I]] between 503 and 504&nbsp;CE, and became [[Magister militum]] in 528&nbsp;CE. Leontius was also involved as a commissioner in the preparation of the first codex of Justinian.<ref name="Kassir 2010, p. 52"/><ref>Collinet 1925, pp. 141<U+2013>154</ref> His contemporary, Amblichus, wrote a commentary on Ulpian's ''Libri ad Edictum''.<ref>Collinet 1925, p. 141</ref>

Historical sources also tell of Euxenius, a teacher at the Beirut law school who taught during the times of the "Ecumenical Masters". Euxenius was the brother of the city's bishop Eustathius and was involved in the 460&nbsp;CE religious controversy caused by [[Pope Timothy II of Alexandria|Timothy Aelurus]], which opposed the [[Miaphysitism|Miaphysites]] to the followers of the [[Council of Chalcedon]].<ref>Collinet 1925, p. 154</ref>
[[Dorotheus (jurist)|Dorotheus]], Anatolius (son of Leontius) and Julianus were school professors contemporary to Justinian I. The first two were summoned to the imperial court and commissioned to draft the ''Digesta''. Under the supervision of [[Tribonian]], Dorotheus also collaborated with Theophilus, a Constantinopolitan law teacher, in drafting the ''Institutiones''.<ref>Collinet 1925, pp. 186<U+2013>189</ref><ref name="digest2">Monro 1872, p. XXIX</ref> Julianus, the last known professor of Beirut's law school, was extolled by Theaetetus as "the light of the law".<ref>Pringsheim 1921, p. 272</ref> After the earthquake, Julianus left Beirut and settled in Constantinople, where he authored the ''[[Novellae Constitutiones|Epitome Iuliani]]'' in 555&nbsp;CE.<ref>Collinet 1925, pp. 190<U+2013>191</ref>

Under Justinian, there were eight teachers in the law schools of the [[Byzantine Empire]], presumably four in each of Beirut and Constantinople's schools.<ref name="Jolowicz 1972, p. 454"/><ref>Collinet 1925, p. 211</ref> Justinian mandated the supervision and enforcement of discipline in the school of Beirut to the teachers, the city's bishop and the [[Praeses|governor]] of Phoenicia Maritima.<ref name="digest"/><ref>Collinet 1925, p. 34</ref>

===Notable students===
While most of the law school's students are not remembered by history, ancient historians and sources recount the stories of some of those who were deemed notable and achieved fame.

According to [[Eusebius|Eusebius of Caesarea]], [[Pamphilus of Caesarea]] was born into a rich family in Beirut in the latter half of the third century and attended its law school. Pamphilus later became the [[presbyter]] of Caesarea Maritima and the founder of its extensive Christian library. He is celebrated as a martyr by both the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]] and the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]. Eusebius also tells of martyred brothers [[Aphian]] and [[Aedesius of Alexandria|Aedesius]], born to a noble [[Lycia]]n family. They converted to Christianity while studying law in Beirut and were persecuted and executed for their beliefs.<ref>Collinet 1925, pp. 27<U+2013>30</ref>

Fourth-century historian [[Eunapius]] wrote of [[Anatolius]], a high-ranking Roman official known to his enemies as ''Azutrio''. Anatolius occupied the offices of consul of Syria, [[vicarius]] of the [[Diocese of Asia]], [[proconsul]] of Constantinople, [[List of urban prefects of Constantinople|urban prefect of Constantinople]] in 354&nbsp;CE, and [[Praetorian prefecture of Illyricum|Praetorian prefect of Illyricum]] until his death in 360&nbsp;CE. In his account of Anatolius, Eunapius summarized: "He reached the summit of the science of law. Nothing about this is surprising because Beirut, his homeland, is the mother and nurse of these studies".<ref name="Collinet 1925, pp. 30<U+2013>32">Collinet 1925, pp. 30<U+2013>32</ref><ref>Eunapius 1596, pp. 148<U+2013>151</ref>
Libanius' correspondence with Gaianus of Tyre discusses the latter's achievements after his graduation from the law school of Beirut; Gaianus became the [[List of Roman governors of Syria#Consularis Governors of Syria Phoenicia (c. 295 CE to c. 395 CE)|consular governor of Phoenicia]] in 362&nbsp;CE.<ref>Collinet 1925, pp. 87<U+2013>88</ref>
[[Gaza]]n lawyer and church historian [[Sozomen]], also a law student at Beirut, wrote in his ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' about [[Triphyllius]], a convert to Christendom who became the bishop of Nicosia. Triphyllius received juridic training in Beirut and was criticized by his teacher [[Saint Spyridon]] for his [[atticism]] and for using legal vocabulary instead of that of the Bible.<ref name="Collinet 1925, pp. 30<U+2013>32"/>

Zacharias Rhetor studied law at Beirut between 487 and 492&nbsp;CE, then worked as a lawyer in Constantinople until his imperial contacts won him the appointment as bishop of [[Mytilene]]. Among Rhetor's works is the biography of [[Severus of Antioch|Severus]], the last [[Monophysitism|monophysite]] patriarch of Antioch and one of the founders of the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]], who had also been a law student in Beirut as of 486&nbsp;CE.<ref>Collinet 1925, pp. 46<U+2013>51</ref><ref name="Greatrex 2011, pp. 6<U+2013>7">Greatrex 2011, pp. 6<U+2013>7</ref> Another late fifth-century student was [[John Rufus]], an anti-[[Chalcedonian Christianity|Chalcedonian]] priest who moved to [[Maiuma]] after the expulsion of his master, [[Peter the Fuller]]. In Maiuma, John Rufus authored the ''Plerophoriae'' and the ''Life of [[Peter the Iberian]]''.<ref>Sterk 2009, p. 208</ref><ref name="Collinet 1925, p. 51">Collinet 1925, p. 51</ref>

==Location==
Historically, Roman ''stationes'' or ''auditoria'', where teaching was done, stood next to public libraries housed in temples. This arrangement was copied in the Roman colony at Beirut. The first mention of the school's premises dates to 350&nbsp;CE,<ref>Collinet 1925, p. 62</ref> but the description does not specify its location. In the fifth century, Zacharias Rhetor reported that the school stood next to the "Temple of God", the description of which permitted its identification with the Byzantine Anastasis cathedral.<ref>Collinet 1925, pp. 63<U+2013>73</ref>

At the turn of the twentieth century, archaeological excavations in the [[souq]] between the Saint George Greek Orthodox Cathedral and [[Saint George Maronite Cathedral, Beirut|Saint George Cathedral of the Maronites]] unearthed a funerary [[stele]] etched with an epitaph to a man named Patricius, "whose career was consecrated for the study of law".<ref>Collinet 1925, p. 73</ref> The epitaph was identified as being dedicated to the famous fifth-century law school professor.<ref>Collinet 1925, pp. 61<U+2013>73</ref> In 1994, archaeological diggings underneath the Saint George Greek Orthodox Cathedral in [[Beirut Central District]]'s Nejmeh Square identified structural elements of the Anastasis cathedral, but they were restricted to an area of {{convert|316|m2|sqft}} and failed to unearth the interred school.<ref name="Sartre 2005, p. 291"/><ref>Skaf 2005, pp. 224<U+2013>229</ref><ref>Jones Hall 2004, p. 67</ref>

The law school of Beirut supplied the Roman Empire, especially its eastern provinces, with lawyers and magistrates for three centuries until the school's destruction. The influx of students was abundant and persistent because of the affluence, honor and secured employment offered by the profession.<ref>Rawlinson 2004, p. 265</ref> A degree in law became highly sought following an edict issued in 460&nbsp;CE by Emperor [[Leo I the Thracian|Leo I]]. The edict ordered that candidates for the bar of the Eastern [[praetorian prefect]]ure had to produce certificates of proficiency from the law teachers who instructed them at one of the recognized law schools of the Empire.<ref name="Mousourakis 2003, p. 363"/><ref>Jolowicz 1972, pp. 454<U+2013>455</ref>

The in-depth studies of the juridic classical works in Beirut, and later in Constantinople, conferred an unprecedented scientific dimension to jurisprudence; this academic movement gave rise to the minds behind Justinian's juridic reforms. As a result of the new understanding of the classical juridic texts, the imperial laws of the late fifth and early sixth centuries were clearer and more coherent than those of the early [[Postclassical Era]], according to legal historian George Mousourakis and other scholars.<ref name="Jolowicz 1972, pp. 451<U+2013>460">Jolowicz 1972, pp. 451<U+2013>460</ref><ref name="Kunkel">Kunkel 1973, p. 146</ref><ref name="Schuz">Schulz 1967, p. 267</ref><ref>Mousourakis 2003, p. 364</ref>

The school garnered accolades throughout its existence and was bestowed with the title ''Berytus Nutrix Legum'' (Beirut, Mother of Laws) by Eunapius, Libanius, Zacharias Rhetor and finally by Emperor Justinian.<ref name="Collinet 1925, p. 51"/> His 533&nbsp;CE ''Omnem'' constitution read:
<blockquote>These three works which we have composed we desire should be put in their hands in royal cities as well as in the most fair city of Berytus, which may well be styled the nursing mother of law, as indeed previous Emperors have commanded, but in no other places which did not enjoy the same privilege in old times, as we have heard that even in the brilliant city of Alexandria, and in Caesarea and others, there have been ignorant men who, instead of doing their duty, conveyed spurious lessons to their pupils, and such as these we desire to make desist from that attempt by laying down the above limits, so that, if they should hereafter be guilty of such conduct and carry on their duties outside the royal cities and the metropolis Berytus, they may be punished by a fine of ten pounds of gold and be expelled from the city in which instead of teaching the law they transgress the law.<ref name="digest"/></blockquote>

From the third century on, the school tolerated Christian teachings, producing a number of students who would become influential church leaders and bishops, such as Pamphilus of Caesarea, Severus of Antioch and Aphian. Under Cyrillus, the first of the Ecumenical Masters, the Christian faith was consolidated as an integral element of the juristic training.<ref name="Kassir 2010, p. 53">Kassir 2010, p. 53</ref><ref>Attridge  1992, p. 436</ref>

Two professors from the law school of Beirut, Dorotheus and Anatolius, had such a repute for their wisdom and knowledge that they were especially praised by Justinian in the opening of his ''Tanta'' constitution. The emperor summoned both professors to assist his minister Tribonian in compiling the Codex of Justinian,<ref name="digest"/> the Empire's body of civil laws issued between 529 and 534&nbsp;CE. The ''Tanta'' passage reads:
<blockquote>... Dorotheus, an illustrious man, of great eloquence and qu<U+00E6>storian rank, whom, when he was engaged in delivering the law to students in the most brilliant city of Berytus,we, moved by his great reputation and renown, summoned to our presence and made to share in the work in question; again, Anatolius, an illustrious person, a magistrate, who, like the last, was invited to this work when acting as an exponent of law at Berytus, a man who came of an ancient stock, as both his father Leontius and his grandfather Eudoxius left behind them an excellent report in respect of legal learning...<ref name="digest2" /></blockquote>

For centuries following its compilation, the work of Justinian's commission was studied and incorporated into the legal systems of different nations and has profoundly impacted the [[Byzantine law]] and the [[Western law|Western legal tradition]].<ref>Goodman 1995, p. 222</ref> Peter Stein asserts that the texts of ancient Roman law have constituted "a kind of legal supermarket, in which lawyers of different periods have found what they needed at the time."<ref>Stein 1999, pp. 1<U+2013>2</ref>

[[File:Digesto 02.jpg|thumb|alt=Title page of an old book with ornate decorative motifs depicting a mermaid, a merman and various other creatures surrounding the Title text |Title page of a late sixteenth-century edition of the ''Digesta'', part of Emperor [[Justinian I]]'s ''[[Corpus Juris Civilis]]'']]
The ''Corpus Juris Civilis'' remained the basis of Byzantine law until the publication of the ''[[Byzantine law#Ecloga|Ecloga legum]]'' in 741&nbsp;CE by Emperor [[Leo III the Isaurian|Leo III]] and his son and co-regent [[Constantine V]]. The ''Ecloga'' was a shortened and more philanthropic version of the Codex of Justinian, whose dispositions were more in tune with [[Christian values]]. It was written in Greek, since Latin had fallen into disuse, and its provisions continued to be applied in later centuries in the neighboring Balkan and Asia Minor regions, with surviving translations in [[Slavic languages|Slavic]], [[Armenian language|Armenian]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]].<ref name="Mousourakis 2003, pp. 403<U+2013>404">Mousourakis 2003, pp. 403<U+2013>404</ref><ref name="Stein 1999, p. 35">Stein 1999, p. 35</ref><ref name="Reinink 2002, pp. 191<U+2013>192">Reinink 2002, pp. 191<U+2013>192</ref> Emperor [[Basil I]], who ruled in the ninth century, issued the ''Prochiron'' and the ''Epanagoge'', which were legal compilations invalidating parts of the ''Ecloga'' and restoring the Justinian laws.<ref name="Mousourakis 2003, p. 405">Mousourakis 2003, p. 405</ref><ref name="Lokin 1994, pp. 71<U+2013>91">Lokin 1994, pp. 71<U+2013>91</ref> The ''Prochiron'' served as the basis for the legal writings of the twelfth-century first archbishop of Serbia, [[Saint Sava]]. His legal compilation was intended for the [[Serbian Orthodox Church|Serbian church]] but the influential work was adopted as the basic constitution for the Bulgarian and Russian orthodox churches.<ref name="Sedlar 2011, pp. 306<U+2013>307">Sedlar 2011, pp. 306<U+2013>307</ref> Around 900&nbsp;CE, Emperor [[Leo VI the Wise|Leo VI]] commissioned the ''Basilica'', a Greek rewriting of the Justinian laws that is considered the ancestor of modern Greece's law until the enactment of the Code of 1940.<ref name="Stein 1999, pp. 35<U+2013>36">Stein 1999, pp. 35<U+2013>36</ref>

The Codex of Justinian also had a great influence on Western law, particularly on the juridic history and tradition of western Europe and its American colonies. In Italy, a single complete copy of the Justinian Digest survived and laid forgotten until its rediscovery in 1070.<ref name="Kuttner 1991, pp. 299<U+2013>300">Kuttner 1991, pp. 299<U+2013>300</ref> In 1088, [[Irnerius]], a jurist and teacher of the liberal arts in [[Bologna]], was the first to teach the newly recovered Digest and the rest of Justinian's books. He and his successors explained the Roman laws to their students by means of glosses or explanatory notes written on the edges or between the text lines. The Roman legal concepts resulting from the studies of these "[[glossator]]s" spread to the universities and law courts of Europe.<ref name="Evans 2005, p. 25">Evans 2005, p. 25</ref>  The Roman law revival that started in Italy, during the Middle Ages, was taken up by France, the Netherlands and Germany in later centuries.<ref name="Stein 1999, p. 2">Stein 1999, p. 2</ref> The enactment of the German Civil Code in 1900 put an end to the application of extant forms of law derived from the Justinian codes in most European states.<ref name="Stein 1999, p. 128">Stein 1999, p. 128</ref>

The reputation of Beirut as "mother of laws" reemerged in modern times.<ref name="Kassir 2010, p. 53"/> In 1913, [[Paul Huvelin]], the first dean of the newly established [[Saint Joseph University|Universit<U+00E9> Saint-Joseph]]'s Faculty of Law, dedicated the inaugural speech to the classical law school of Beirut in an effort to confer legitimacy to the new academy.<ref name="Kassir 2010, p. 53"/><ref name="Kassir 2010, p. 199">Kassir 2010, p. 199</ref> The epithet ''Berytus Nutrix Legum'' is used as a motto and as part of the emblem of the Beirut Bar Association, founded in 1919.<ref name="Kassir 2010, p. 53"/> It is also featured in the seal and flag of the Municipality of Beirut.<ref name="log">{{Cite web | url=http://beirut.gov.lb/ | title = Beirut Official Website | publisher = Municipality of Beirut | accessdate = June 23, 2013}}</ref>
