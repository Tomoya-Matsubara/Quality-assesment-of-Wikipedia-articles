'''Skywalker Sound''' is the [[sound effects]], [[sound editorial]], [[sound design]] and [[music]] recording division of [[George Lucas|George Lucas's]] [[Lucas Digital]] [[film|motion picture]] group.  Its main facilities are located in [[Lucas Valley]], near [[Nicasio, California|Nicasio]], [[California]]. It began as '''Sprocket Systems''' in [[San Anselmo, California]] and changed names soon after the release of ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]''. 

While located in San Anselmo, Sprocket Systems came into contact with the local residents from time to time. For instance, Kentfield resident Pat Walsh, "discovered" while shopping at a camera store, provided the voice for [[E.T.]]. During the sound recording of ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'', [[Harrison Ford]] could be spied practicing his bullwhip technique in the parking lot.<ref>[http://www.sananselmohistory.org/1970narrative.html San Anselmo Historical Museum: ''1970: Approaching the 21st Century'']</ref>

Sprocket Systems moved from San Anselmo following a disastrous flood in January of 1982. 

Its staff of [[sound design|Sound Designer]]s and [[Re-Recording Mixer]]s have either won or been nominated for the [[Academy Award for Sound Editing|Best Sound or Best Sound Editing Academy Award]] every year since ''[[Star Wars]]'' in [[1978]] (in that year [[Ben Burtt]] was given a Special Achievement Award, since the category for Sound Editing had not yet been established). 

Dubbing facilities, editorial services and scoring stages are all located in a central "Tech Building," with dining areas and living quarters in the vicinity but separate from the main work area.
