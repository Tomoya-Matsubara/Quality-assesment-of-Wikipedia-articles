'''HMS ''Warrior''''' was the [[name ship]] of her [[Warrior-class ironclad|class]] of two [[armoured frigate]]s<ref group=Note>Ironclad is the general term for armoured warships of this period. Armoured frigates were initially designed for the same role as traditional wooden frigates; this later changed as the size and expense of these ships forced them to be used in the line of battle.</ref> built for the [[Royal Navy]] in 1859<U+2013>61. She and her [[sister ship]] {{HMS|Black Prince|1861|6}} were the first armour-plated, iron-[[hull (watercraft)|hulled]] [[warship]]s, and were built in response to France's launching in 1859 of the first ocean-going [[ironclad warship]], the wooden-hulled [[French ironclad Gloire|''Gloire'']]. ''Warrior'' conducted a publicity tour of Great Britain in 1863 and spent her active career with the [[Channel Squadron]]. She became obsolescent following the 1871 launching of the mastless and more capable [[HMS Devastation (1871)|HMS ''Devastation'']], and was placed in [[Reserve fleet|reserve]] in 1875 and [[Ship decommissioning|paid off]] in 1883.

She subsequently served as a storeship and [[depot ship]], and in 1904 was assigned to the Royal Navy's torpedo training school. The ship was converted into an oil [[jetty]] in 1927 and remained in that role until 1979, at which point she was donated by the Navy to [[the Maritime Trust]] for restoration. The restoration process took eight years, during which many of her features and fittings were either restored or recreated. When this was finished she returned to [[Portsmouth]] as a [[museum ship]]. Listed as part of the [[National Historic Fleet, Core Collection|National Historic Fleet]], ''Warrior'' has been based in Portsmouth since 1987.

==Background==
The [[Ship naming and launching|launching]] of the steam-powered [[ship of the line]] [[French ship Napol<U+00E9>on (1850)|''Napol<U+00E9>on'']] by France in 1850 began an arms race between France and Britain that lasted for a decade. The destruction of Russian coastal fortifications during the [[Battle of Kinburn (1855)|Battle of Kinburn]] in the Crimean War by French armoured [[floating battery|floating batteries]], and tests against armour plates, showed the superiority of ironclads over unarmoured ships. France's launching in 1859 of the first ocean-going [[ironclad warship]], the wooden-hulled [[French ironclad Gloire|''Gloire'']], upset the balance of power by neutralising the British investment in wooden ships of the line<ref>{{harvnb|Baxter|1968|pages=120<U+2013>27}}</ref> and started an invasion scare in Britain, as the Royal Navy lacked any ships that could counter ''Gloire'' and her two sisters. The situation was perceived to be so serious that [[Queen Victoria]] asked the [[Admiralty]] if the navy was adequate for the tasks that it would have to perform in wartime.<ref>{{harvnb|Lambert|1984|pages=71<U+2013>72}}</ref> ''Warrior'' and her sister were ordered in response.<ref>{{harvnb|Parkes|1990|page=6}}</ref>

The Admiralty initially specified that the ship should be capable of {{convert|15|kn|lk=in}}, and have a full set of sails for world-wide cruising range. Iron construction was chosen as it gave the best trade-off between speed and protection; an iron hull was lighter than a wooden one of the same size and shape, giving more capacity for guns, armour and engines.<ref>{{harvnb|Padfield|2000|page=22}}</ref>

==Design and description==

===Overview===
Chief Constructor of the Navy [[Isaac Watts (naval architect)|Isaac Watts]] and Chief Engineer Thomas Lloyd designed the ship.<ref>{{harvnb|Brown|2006|page=113}}</ref> To minimise risk they copied the hull design of the large wooden [[frigate]] {{HMS|Mersey|1858|6}}, modifying it for iron construction and to accommodate an armoured box, or citadel, [[amidships]] along the single gun deck, which protected most of the ship's guns.<ref>{{harvnb|Lambert|1987|pages=20<U+2013>23}}</ref> Ships with this configuration of guns and armour are classified as [[broadside ironclad]]s.<ref name=ck7/>

The ''Warrior''-class design used many well-proven technologies that had been used in ocean-going ships for years, including her iron hull, [[marine steam engine|steam engine]], and [[propeller (marine)|screw propeller]]; only her [[wrought-iron]] armour was a major technological advance. [[Naval architecture|Naval architect]] and historian David K. Brown wrote, "What made [''Warrior''] truly novel was the way in which these individual aspects were blended together, making her the biggest and most powerful warship in the world."<ref name="b12">{{harvnb|Brown|2003|page=12}}</ref> Being faster, better armoured and harder to hit than her rivals, she was superior to any existing naval ship. The Admiralty immediately stopped the construction of all wooden ships of the line, and ordered another eleven ironclads over the next few years. [[John Fisher, 1st Baron Fisher|Jacky Fisher]], who was the ship's gunnery lieutenant in 1863<U+2013>64, later wrote that in spite of this, most people did not realise at the time what a significant change it would bring about: "It certainly was not appreciated that this, our first armourclad ship of war, would cause a fundamental change in what had been in vogue for something like a thousand years."<ref name="Padfieldp24">{{harvnb|Padfield|2000|page=24}}</ref>

Although built in response to ''Gloire'', the ''Warrior''s had a very different operational concept than the French ship, which was meant to replace wooden ships of the line. They were designed by Watts as 40-gun armoured frigates and were not intended to stand in the [[line of battle]], as the [[Admiralty]] was uncertain about their ability to withstand concentrated fire from wooden two- and three-deck ships of the line. Unlike ''Gloire'', they were planned to be fast enough to force battle on a fleeing enemy and to control the range at which a battle was fought to their own advantage.<ref>{{harvnb|Lambert|1987|pages=18, 20<U+2013>21}}</ref> In contrast to ''Gloire''{{'}}s square profile, ''Warrior'' has a [[clipper]] bow, but she is twice as long as a typical clipper ship.<ref name="Padfield 2000 23">{{harvnb|Padfield|2000|page=23}}</ref>

HMS ''Warrior'' is {{convert|380|ft|2|in|m|1}} [[Length between perpendiculars|long between perpendiculars]] and {{convert|420|ft|m|1}} long [[length overall|overall]]. She has a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|58|ft|4|in|m|1}} and a [[Draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|26|ft|9|in|m|1}}. The ship [[displacement (ship)|displaces]] {{convert|9137|LT|t}} and has a [[tonnage]] of 6,109 [[Builder's Old Measurement|tons burthen]].<ref name="b1">{{harvnb|Ballard|1980|page=241}}</ref> The ship's length made her relatively unmanoeuvrable, making it harder for her to use her strengthened stem for [[ramming]], an ancient tactic that was coming back into use at the time.<ref name=Padfieldp24/> The ends of the hull are subdivided by watertight transverse [[Bulkhead (partition)|bulkhead]]s and decks into 92 compartments, and the hull has a [[double bottom]] underneath the [[engine room|engine]] and [[boiler room (ship)|boiler room]]s.<ref name="p18">{{harvnb|Parkes|1990|pages=17<U+2013>18}}</ref>

===Armament===
[[File:RBL 7 inch Armstrong gun HMS Warrior left side.jpg|thumb|right|One of the replica 110-pounder breech-loaders on the restored ''Warrior'']]
The armament of the ''Warrior''-class ships was originally intended to be forty [[British ordnance terms#SBML|smoothbore, muzzle-loading]] [[68-pounder gun]]s, nineteen on each side on the main deck and one each fore and aft as [[chase gun]]s on the upper deck. The {{convert|7.9|in|mm|sing=on|sigfig=3}} 68-pounder had a range of {{convert|3200|yd}} with [[roundshot|solid shot]]. During construction the armament was changed to include ten [[RBL 7 inch Armstrong gun|Armstrong 110-pounder guns]], an early [[rifled breech loader]] (RBL) design, along with twenty-six 68-pounders, and four RBL [[RBL 40 pounder Armstrong gun|Armstrong 40-pounder guns]] with a calibre of {{convert|4.75|in|0}} and a maximum range of {{convert|3800|yd}}. It had been planned to replace all the 68-pounders with the innovative 110-pounder, whose {{convert|7|in|mm|sing=on|sigfig=3}} shell could reach {{convert|4000|yd}}, but poor results in armour-penetration tests halted this.<ref name="Lambert82">{{harvnb|Lambert|1987|page=82}}</ref> The 110-pounders blew up when other ships used them in action,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pdavis.nl/Japan.htm|title=W.L. Clowes on the Anglo-Japanese hostilities of 1863<U+2013>1864|accessdate=4 August 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.pdavis.nl/Japan.php|title=The Armstrong Guns In Japan|date=25 April 1864|work=The Times|accessdate=4 August 2013}}</ref> were labour-intensive to load and fire,<ref>{{cite book|last=Holley|first=Alexander Lyman|title=A Treatise on Ordnance and Armor|url=http://www.archive.org/details/treatiseonordnan00hollrich|year=1865|publisher=D Van Nostrand|location=New York|page=602}}</ref> and were henceforth only used with a reduced propellant charge, which left them useless in practice.<ref>{{cite book|last=Owen|first=Lieutenant-Colonel C H |title=The principles and practice of modern artillery|url=http://www.archive.org/details/principlespracti00owenrich|edition=Second|year=1873|publisher=John Murray|location=London|page=52}}</ref>

All the guns could fire either solid shot or [[Shell (projectile)|explosive shells]]. The 68-pounders could also fire hollow iron shells filled with molten iron, which was heated in a furnace between the two forward [[boiler (steam generator)|boiler]]s.<ref>{{harvnb|Lambert|1987|pages=82, 85<U+2013>87, 89, 102}}</ref> The 40-pounder Armstrong guns were replaced with a better design of the same calibre in 1863.<ref name="Lambert85">{{harvnb|Lambert|1987|page=85}}</ref> ''Warrior''{{'}}s original armament was replaced during her 1864<U+2013>67 refit with twenty-four 7-inch and four {{convert|8|in|0|adj=on}} [[Muzzle-loading rifle|rifled muzzle-loading (RML) guns]]. The ship also received four [[RBL 20 pounder Armstrong gun|RBL Armstrong 20-pounders]] for use as [[saluting gun]]s.<ref name="p19">{{harvnb|Parkes|1990|page=19}}</ref> The [[RML 8 inch 9 ton gun|RML 8-inch gun]] could penetrate {{convert|9.6|in|mm|0}} of wrought iron armour at the [[muzzle (firearms)|muzzle]], and the [[RML 7 inch 6.5 ton gun|RML 7-inch gun]] could pierce {{convert|7.7|in|mm|0}}.<ref>{{harvnb|Chesneau|Kolesnik|1979|page=6}}</ref>

===Armour===
[[File:HMS Warrior(1860)bulkheadarmour.JPG|thumb|right|Cross section of ''Warrior''{{'}}s bulkhead armour. Iron on the right backed by teak.]]
''Warrior''{{'}}s armour consisted of {{convert|4.5|in|mm|0}} of wrought iron backed by {{convert|18|in|mm|0}} of [[teak]].<ref name="Padfield 2000 23"/> The iron armour was made up of {{convert|3|by|12|ft|adj=on}} plates that interlocked via the [[tongue and groove]] method. It was bolted through the teak to the iron hull. The teak consisted of two {{convert|9|in|mm|adj=mid|-thick|0}} layers laid at right angles to each other; they strengthened the armour by damping the shock waves caused by the impact of shells that would otherwise break the bolts connecting the armour to the hull.<ref>{{harvnb|Lambert|1987|pages=67, 69}}</ref> Based on tests at [[Shoeburyness]] in October 1861 when the ''Warrior'' was launched, it "was practically invulnerable to the ordnance at the time in use".<ref>{{cite book|title=Appletons' Annual Cyclopaedia and Register of Important Events of the Year: 1862|year=1863|publisher=D. Appleton & Company|location=New York|page=621|url=http://archive.org/stream/1862appletonsan02newyuoft#page/n627/mode/1up}}</ref>

The armour covered the middle {{convert|213|ft|1}} of the ship and extended {{convert|16|ft|1}} above the [[waterline]] and {{convert|6|ft|1}} below it. The guns on the main deck were protected from [[raking fire]] by 4.5-inch transverse bulkheads. The ends of the ship were unprotected, but were subdivided into watertight compartments to minimise flooding. The lack of armour at the stern meant that the steering gear and rudder were vulnerable.<ref>{{harvnb|Parkes|1990|page=18}}</ref>

===Crew===
The ship's crew comprised 50 officers and 656 enlisted men in 1863.<ref>{{harvnb|Wells|1987|page=212}}</ref> The majority of the crew had to do physically demanding tasks; one such duty was the raising of the heaviest manually hauled anchors in maritime history. The day-to-day life of her crew differed little from those on the navy's traditional wooden-hulled vessels.<ref name="lifeonboard">{{cite web|url=http://www.hmswarrior.org/history/lifeonboard|title=Life on Board|publisher=HMS Warrior Preservation Trust|accessdate=3 June 2013}}</ref>

The majority of the crew lived on the single gun deck of the Warrior; these crewmen slept in hammocks slung from the sides and deck beams, with up to 18 men between each pair of guns. The officers berthed in the rear of the ship in small individual cabins, the [[wardroom]] was also the officer's mess. The captain had two spacious, well-furnished cabins.<ref name = 'lifeonboard'/>

Of the enlisted men, 122 were [[Royal Marines]]. As an experiment during the ship's first commission, all of Warrior's marines were from [[Royal Marine Artillery]]; subsequently some marine infantrymen were assigned as was the usual naval practice. The marines manned the aft section of guns and slung their hammocks between the crew's accommodation and the officers' cabins.<ref>{{harvnb|Wells|1987|pages=81<U+2013>82}}</ref>

===Propulsion===
''Warrior'' had a two-cylinder [[trunk engine|trunk steam engine]], made by [[John Penn (engineer)|John Penn and Sons]], driving a single propeller<ref>{{harvnb|Ballard|1980|page=246}}</ref> using steam provided by 10 rectangular boilers.<ref name="ck7">{{harvnb|Chesneau|Kolesnik|1979|page=7}}</ref> The engine produced a total of {{convert|5772|ihp|lk=in}} during ''Warrior''{{'}}s [[sea trial]]s on 1 April 1868 giving a speed of {{convert|14.08|kn|lk=in}} under steam alone.<ref>{{harvnb|Ballard|1980|pages=246<U+2013>47}}</ref> The ship carried {{convert|853|LT|t}}<ref name=w9/> of coal, enough to steam {{convert|2100|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|11|kn}}.<ref name="p01">{{harvnb|Parkes|1990|pages=20<U+2013>21}}</ref>

The ironclad was [[ship rig]]ged and had a sail area of {{convert|48400|sqft|sqm|0}}. ''Warrior'' reached {{convert|13|kn}} under sail alone, {{convert|2|kn}} faster than her [[sister ship]] {{HMS|Black Prince|1861|2}}. She had the largest hoisting propeller ever made; it weighed {{convert|26|LT|t|adj=off}},<ref name="w9">{{harvnb|Wells|1987|page=59}}</ref> and 600 men could raise it into the ship to reduce drag while under sail.<ref name=p01/> To further reduce drag, both her [[funnel (ship)|funnels]] were telescopic and could be lowered.<ref>{{harvnb|Lambert|1987|page=108}}</ref> Under sail and steam together, the ship once reached {{convert|17.5|kn}} against the [[tide]] while running from [[Portsmouth]] to [[Plymouth]].<ref>{{harvnb|Parkes|1990|page=21}}</ref>

==Construction and service==
''Warrior'' was ordered on 11 May 1859<ref name=b0>{{harvnb|Ballard|1980|page=240}}</ref> from [[Thames Ironworks and Shipbuilding Company]] in [[Blackwall, London]]. The ship was [[keel|laid down]] some time after 6 June 1859 when the [[Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company|P&O]] [[ocean liner]] ''Seine'' was launched, and the [[slipway]] was reinforced to support ''Warrior''{{'}}s weight. Full-scale production of the ship's iron began in August, and the construction probably began in mid-August. Indecision by the Admiralty and frequent design changes caused many delays and nearly drove her builders [[bankrupt]] before a grant of [[pound sterling|<U+00A3>]]50,000 was awarded to keep them solvent.<ref>{{harvnb|Lambert|2010|pages=34, 37}}</ref> Her launching on 29 December 1860 was during the coldest winter for 50 years. She was frozen to her slipway and required the use of [[hydraulic ram]]s, additional [[tugboat|tugs]], and dockworkers running from side to side on the upper deck to rock her free.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hmswarrior.org/history/construction|title=Construction&nbsp;<U+2013> Launch|publisher=HMS Warrior Preservation Trust|accessdate=23 May 2013}}</ref> ''Warrior'' was [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] in August 1861 to conduct her sea trials; she was completed on 24 October<ref name=b0/> for <U+00A3>377,292,<ref>{{harvnb|Parkes|1990|page=16}}</ref>{{#tag:ref|There is an unusually large spread of figures for the ship's cost, some of which may include the cost of her armament and the <U+00A3>50,000 grant made to her builders.

Changes included the fitting of a lighter [[bowsprit]] and a shorter [[jib boom]], along with the provision of extra [[head (watercraft)|heads]] amidships.<ref name=wells111>{{harvnb|Wells|1987|page=111}}</ref>

The ship was initially assigned to the Channel Squadron under the command of [[Captain (Royal Navy)|Captain]] [[Arthur Cochrane (Royal Navy officer)|Arthur Cochrane]]. In March 1863, ''Warrior'' escorted the [[royal yacht]] that brought Princess [[Alexandra of Denmark]] to Britain to marry the [[Prince of Wales]].<ref>{{harvnb|Ballard|1980|page=55}}</ref> The princess appreciated the conduct of the ship's crew, and requested [[Admiral]] Sir [[Michael Seymour (Royal Navy officer)|Michael Seymour]] to convey that "she was much pleased" to the ship. Cochrane had the message engraved on a brass plate and fitted to the [[ship's wheel]]. In mid-1863 the Channel Fleet toured British ports for 12 weeks; the ship received 300,000 visitors, including as many as 13,000 a day in port.<ref>{{harvnb|Wells|1987|pages=119, 123<U+2013>28}}</ref>
[[File:HMS Warrior 1872.jpg|thumb|right|A painting of ''Warrior'' under sail]]
''Warrior'' began a refit in November 1864 during which the Armstrong guns, which had not proved successful in use, were removed and her armament was upgraded to the latest rifled muzzle-loading guns. She was recommissioned in 1867, under the command of Captain [[Julian Corbett]], to relieve her sister as the [[guard ship|guardship]] at [[Cobh|Queenstown]] in Ireland, but instead both ships participated in the [[Fleet Review]] held on 17 July in honour of the visits made by the [[Isma'il Pasha|Khedive of Egypt]] and the [[Abd<U+00FC>laziz|Sultan of Turkey]] to Britain. After the review, the Admiralty paid off the ship on 24 July; the following day ''Warrior'' was recommissioned with Captain Henry Boys in command. After working up at [[Spithead]], she sailed to join the Channel Squadron on 24 September. At the end of the year she was deployed to [[Osborne Bay]] to guard Queen Victoria at [[Osborne House]]. The [[Fenian Rising]] was under way, and there was intelligence suggesting that the Queen might be in danger from Irish nationalists. While ''Warrior'' was performing this duty, she received an informal visit from the Queen. The ship was part of a squadron that escorted the royal yacht {{ship|HMY|Victoria and Albert II}} to [[Dublin]] in April 1868 for an official visit by the Prince of Wales, the future [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|King Edward VII]]. In August, while cruising to Scotland, ''Warrior'' collided with {{HMS|Royal Oak|1862|6}}, losing her figurehead and jib boom and smashing ''Royal Oak''{{'}}s [[Cutter (boat)|cutter]]. Boys was [[court-martial]]led and acquitted over the incident.<ref>{{harvnb|Wells|1987|pages=138<U+2013>43}}</ref>

From 4 to 28 July 1868, ''Warrior'', with ''Black Prince'' and the wooden paddle frigate {{HMS|Terrible|1845|6}}, towed a specially built [[floating drydock]], large enough to accommodate ironclads, {{convert|2700|nmi|abbr=on}} across the Atlantic from [[Madeira]] to [[Bermuda]]. Upon her return to England in late August, Boys was relieved by Captain [[Frederick Stirling]]. After a refit to clean her hull and replace the figurehead lost in the collision, ''Warrior'' rejoined the Channel Squadron. On 2 March 1870, Captain Henry Glyn assumed command of the ship. While returning from a joint cruise with the Mediterranean Fleet, the ship was present when {{HMS|Captain|1869|6}} was lost during a severe storm on 7 September. Further cruises followed, including trips to Madeira and [[Gibraltar]].<ref>{{harvnb|Wells|1987|pages=144<U+2013>54}}</ref> ''Warrior'' narrowly missed colliding with {{HMS|Agincourt|1865|6}} when she was following her out of Gibraltar and ''Agincourt'' [[Ship grounding|grounded]] on Pearl Rock.<ref name=brown84 >{{harvnb|Ballard|1980|page=56}}</ref>
[[File:Portsmouth HMS Warrior citadel 13-10-2011 13-38-31.png|thumb|left|''Warrior''{{'}}s gun deck after restoration]]
The rapid evolution of warship design, for which ''Warrior'' was partly responsible, meant that she [[Ironclad#End of the ironclad|started to become obsolete]] only ten years after she had been launched. In 1871 the Royal Navy commissioned its first mastless capital ship, [[HMS Devastation (1871)|HMS ''Devastation'']].<ref>{{harvnb|Lambert|2010|page=44}}</ref> In the absence of masts, the main armament could move from the broadside and traverse more freely from a higher position.<ref>{{harvnb|Sandler|2004|page=39}}</ref> In the same year, ''Warrior'' began a refit that lasted until 1875; it added a [[poop deck]] and steam [[capstan (nautical)|capstan]], a shorter bowsprit, and replacement boilers.<ref>{{harvnb|Lambert|2010|page=49}}</ref> In April 1875, the ship was recommissioned, and assigned to the First Reserve, where she served as a guardship at [[Portland Harbour|Portland]].<ref name="brown84" /> In this role, she went on annual summer cruises to various ports. During the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877<U+2013>78)|Russo-Turkish War]] of 1877<U+2013>78, she was mobilised due to concerns that the victorious Russians might be about to attack [[Constantinople]], forcing Great Britain to intervene, but nothing transpired and ''Warrior'' cruised to [[Bantry Bay]] instead. In April 1881 she was transferred to the [[Firth of Clyde|Clyde District]], where she served as guardship until 31 May 1883. Two of her masts were discovered to be rotten that month and with no replacements available, the ship was decommissioned and the masts removed.<ref name=Lambert40>{{harvnb|Lambert|2010|pages=49<U+2013>51}}</ref>

''Warrior'' was reclassified as a "screw battle ship, third class, armoured" in 1887 and again in May 1892 as a first-class [[armored cruiser|armoured cruiser]], although no changes were made to her.<ref>{{harvnb|Wells|1987|pages=168<U+2013>69}}</ref> She was considered for modernization as late as 1894, but this was rejected as uneconomical after at least one new boiler was installed. The ship was used as a storage [[Hulk (ship)|hulk]] from May 1901 to July 1902.<ref>{{harvnb|Lambert|2010|pages=51<U+2013>52}}</ref> In preparation for her service as a depot ship for a flotilla of [[destroyer]]s, the ship had her engines and boilers removed and part of her upper deck roofed over. ''Warrior'' served in this role from 1902 to 31 March 1904, and was then assigned to the Portsmouth-based {{HMS|Vernon|shore establishment|2}}, the Royal Navy's torpedo-training school. Her name was changed to ''Vernon III'' that month and six new [[Belleville boiler]]s and four [[electric generator]]s were installed so that she could supply steam and electricity to the neighbouring hulks that made up ''Vernon''. Most of the upper deck was roofed over to form classrooms for [[radio]] training, and her fore and mizzen masts were reinstalled.<ref>{{harvnb|Wells|1987|pages=172<U+2013>73}}</ref> In October 1923, the school was transferred to a newly built shore installation, rendering ''Warrior'' and her companion hulks redundant;<ref name=brown85 >{{harvnb|Brown|2009|page=85}}</ref> ''Warrior'' resumed her name on 1 October and the Royal Navy declared her redundant six months later.<ref name=l4/>

The mass scrapping of obsolete ships after [[World War I]] had caused a downturn in demand for scrap iron by the time the Navy decided to sell off ''Warrior'' on 2 April 1925.<ref name=l4/> There was no commercial interest in scrapping the old ship, and she remained at Portsmouth for another four years. She was modified into a mooring jetty beginning on 22 October 1927. This entailed the removal of all of her equipment and masts other than her boilers and generators, and the installation of two diesel-driven emergency pumps. The space under the poop was converted into accommodation for a shipkeeper and his family. The hulk was towed to her new home, [[Pembroke Dock]] in Wales, on 13 March 1929 where she served as a floating oil jetty. For the next fifty years, the ship lay just offshore from an oil depot at Llanion Cove. The Navy covered the ship's upper deck with a thick layer of [[concrete]] during one of her maintenance dockings before [[World War II]].<ref>{{harvnb|Wells|1987|page=176}}</ref> In the war, she served as a base ship for coastal [[minesweeper (ship)|minesweeper]]s and, on 27 August 1942, was renamed as ''Oil Fuel Hulk C77'' to release her name for use by a [[light aircraft carrier]], {{HMS|Warrior|R31|6}}, then under construction.<ref name=l4>{{harvnb|Lambert|2010|page=53}}</ref> She refuelled 5,000 ships during her service at Llanion Cove.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hmswarrior.org/history/obsolescence|title=Obsolescence&nbsp;<U+2014> Llanion Cove|publisher=HMS Warrior Preservation Trust|accessdate=28 March 2013}}</ref>

==Restoration==
[[File:Captian's day cabin HMS warior.JPG|thumb|right|The reproduction captain's day cabin]]
Restoring ''Warrior'' was discussed in the early 1960s, but did not develop into a serious project. In 1967, the [[Greater London Council]] proposed to restore the ship as an attraction in London, but ''Warrior'' was still required in Pembroke by the Royal Navy and the scheme went no further.<ref>{{harvnb|Winton|1987|page=47}}</ref> In 1968 the [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Duke of Edinburgh]] chaired a meeting that discussed preserving and restoring ''Warrior'' and other historic vessels, and a year later the [[Maritime Trust]] was established to save the decrepit ironclad and other historic ships. The Maritime Trust and a major supporter, the [[Manifold Trust]] led by the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Member of Parliament|MP]] [[John Smith (Conservative politician)|John Smith]], maintained an interest in ''Warrior''. In 1976 the Royal Navy announced that the Llanion Oil Depot would close in 1978, and the Manifold Trust began to seek funds to restore her. With the promise of financial support for restoration, the Royal Navy donated the ship to the trust in 1979.<ref name=l7>{{harvnb|Lambert|2010|pages=56<U+2013>57}}, {{harvnb|Wells|1987|pages=180<U+2013>81}}</ref> The Ship's Preservation Trust acquired ownership of the ship in 1983; it became the Warrior Preservation Trust in 1985.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hmswarrior.org/history/restoration|title=Restoration|publisher=HMS Warrior Preservation Trust|accessdate=12 May 2013}}</ref>

In August 1979 ''Warrior'' began her {{convert|800|mi|adj=on}} journey to her temporary home in the Coal Dock at [[Hartlepool]] for restoration as a [[museum ship]]. She arrived on 2 September 1979 and began the <U+00A3>9 million restoration project, largely funded by the Manifold Trust. The Maritime Trust decided to restore ''Warrior'' to her 1862 condition with the aim that no further major work would be necessary for the next 20 years. The first two years of the restoration were generally devoted to safely removing material added after her first commission, like the poop deck<ref>{{harvnb|Lambert|2010|pages=56<U+2013>58, 63<U+2013>65}}</ref> and the {{convert|200|LT|t}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hmswarrior.org/history/restoration|title=Restoration&nbsp;<U+2013> Hartlepool|publisher=HMS Warrior Preservation Trust|accessdate=23 May 2013}}</ref> of concrete decking. Intensive research was done to find detailed descriptions of the ship and her equipment as of 1862 to make the restoration as accurate as economically feasible. Sources included surviving official records, and the papers of those who had served on the ship during her active service. Bolt-holes and ridges in the paint gave clues to the location of some fittings and fixtures, and the sketch plans of [[Midshipman]] Henry Murray, found in Captain Cochrane's Letter Book, showed the locations of the armament, moveable fittings and stores.<ref>{{harvnb|Lambert|2010|pages=60, 168<U+2013>69}}</ref>{{#tag:ref|At this time, midshipmen and [[sub-lieutenant]]s were required to keep a logbook and illustrate it with sketches of the ship's equipment.<ref>{{harvnb|Lambert|2010|page=168}}</ref>|group=Note}}

[[File:HMS Warrior Figurehead - geograph.org.uk - 548079.jpg|thumb|right|''Warrior''{{'}}s figurehead in 2007]]
Work on carving a replacement for ''Warrior''{{'}}s [[figurehead (object)|figurehead]], which was destroyed in the 1960s, began in 1981 using photographs of the original as a guide. The {{convert|12|ft|m|1|adj=on}} work-in-progress was displayed at the 1982 [[London Boat Show|London International Boat Show]] with the carvers still at work; it dominated coverage of the show. Before it was finished in mid-1983, the figurehead appeared on the [[BBC]] children's television programme ''[[Blue Peter]]''. For much of 1984 it was displayed at the Main Gate of the Portsmouth Royal Dockyard. It was mounted on the ship on 6 February 1985.<ref>{{harvnb|Lambert|2010|pages=173<U+2013>74}}</ref>

Replacement of the ship's {{convert|86|ft|3|in|m|1|adj=on}}-tall, {{convert|42|in|m|1|adj=on}}-wide<ref>{{harvnb|Lambert|2010|page=154}}</ref> lower masts in wood was not feasible, so they were made of steel tube cut and welded to shape, with a ladder inside each mast to allow access to the platforms on the masts. The three masts and the bowsprit were stepped in place between September 1984 and February 1985.<ref>{{harvnb|Lambert|2010|pages=155, 158<U+2013>59}}</ref> ''Warrior''{{'}}s engines, boilers and auxiliary machinery were considered too expensive to rebuild, so replicas were built from sheet steel with a few components made from cast iron to duplicate the look of the real equipment. The replica engines can rotate slowly, using electrical power, to allow visitors to imagine how they might have looked in operation.<ref>{{harvnb|Lambert|2010|pages=138, 140<U+2013>41}}</ref>

The [[Rotunda (Woolwich)|Woolwich Rotunda Artillery Museum]] and the [[States of Jersey]] lent examples of ''Warrior''{{'}}s original primary guns, the muzzle-loading 68-pounder and the breech-loading 110-pounder, which were used as [[Molding (process)|moulds]] for [[fiberglass|fibreglass]] replicas. The Armstrong guns were built with working breeches; they, and the muzzles of all the guns, had to be sealed to prevent people leaving rubbish in them. Little information was available on the wooden [[gun carriage]]s despite extensive research, and a prototype had to be developed and tested before they could be built.<ref>{{harvnb|Lambert|2010|pages=118<U+2013>20}}</ref>

===Museum ship===
In 1985 a new berth beside [[Portsmouth Harbour railway station]] was dredged, and a new jetty constructed in preparation for ''Warrior'''s arrival in Portsmouth. The ship left Hartlepool on 12 June 1987 and was towed {{convert|390|mi|km}} to the [[Solent]] in four days. When she entered [[Portsmouth Harbour]] she was welcomed by thousands of people lining the town walls and shore, and by over 90 boats and ships.<ref name=Winton76>{{harvnb|Winton|1987|page=76}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hmswarrior.org/history/homecoming|title=Restoration&nbsp;<U+2014> Homecoming|publisher=HMS Warrior Preservation Trust|accessdate=28 March 2013}}</ref> She opened as a museum on 27 July.<ref>{{harvnb|Winton|1987|page=84}}</ref> The restored ironclad was renamed HMS ''Warrior'' (1860) to avoid confusion with the [[Northwood Headquarters]], commissioned as HMS ''Warrior'' in 1963, which was at the time the operational headquarters of the Royal Navy.<ref name="l4"/>
