'''Bertram Hays "Bert" Jones''' (born [[September 7]], [[1951]], in [[Ruston, Louisiana]]) is a former [[LSU Tigers football|LSU]] and [[National Football League|NFL]] [[quarterback]] who played for the then [[Indianapolis Colts|Baltimore Colts]] and, briefly, the [[Los Angeles Rams]]. At [[Ruston High School]], he was given the nickname, "The Ruston Rifle".  He is the son of Pro Football Hall of Famer, [[Dub Jones]] of the [[Cleveland Browns]].

== College ==
Jones went to the [[Louisiana State University]] in [[Baton Rouge]], where he was a member of the [[Kappa Sigma]] [[Fraternities and sororities|fraternity]] (''Gamma'' chapter), and also played for [[LSU Tigers football|LSU's football team]]. While at LSU, Jones only [[Starting lineup|started]] two games prior to the end of his junior year, but he started every game after that, leading LSU to a 12-2-1 record. During his senior year (1972), LSU went 9-2-1. Except for one week, LSU spent that entire season ranked in the [[Associated Press|AP]] Top 10. That year, Jones became the first quarterback in LSU history to be awarded consensus [[All-American]] honors. Jones also finished 4th in the vote for the [[Heisman Trophy]] and was voted the National Collegiate Player of the Year by the Cleveland Touchdown Club.

One of Bert Jones' most famous moments came in the 1972 LSU-[[Ole Miss Rebels|Ole Miss]] game, when he led LSU to a 17-16 last-second victory by hitting [[Running back|RB]] Brad Davis in the [[end zone]] for a touchdown as time expired. Jones's other major victories included #14 LSU's 28-8 victory over #7 [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|Notre Dame]] in 1971 (televised by [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]) and #8 LSU's 35-7 victory over #9 [[Auburn Tigers football|Auburn]] in 1972.

During his 17 games at LSU, Bert Jones completed 52.6 perdent of his passes for 3,225 yards and 28 touchdowns, which at the time was the most career passing yards and touchdowns of any quarterback in LSU history.

== NFL ==
In 1973, Jones was chosen in the first round (2nd overall) of the [[NFL draft]] by the Baltimore Colts. During his eight year tenure as the Colts' starting QB, Jones and his teammates enjoyed three consecutive [[AFC East]] division titles (1975<U+2013>77). But in each of those years, the Colts lost in the first round of the playoffs. The 1977 playoff game (known as [[Ghost to the Post]]) is famous as the 2nd longest game in NFL history (after the Dolphins-Chiefs double overtime playoff Dec. 25, 1971); the Colts fell to the [[Oakland Raiders]], 37-31. The Colts' fortunes seemed to rise and fall with Jones; he missed most of 1978 and 1979 with a shoulder injury, and the Colts fell to last place in the AFC East those two seasons. 

The 1976 regular season was Bert Jones's finest as a professional as he threw for 3,104 yards and a career high 24 [[touchdown]]s compiling a passer rating of 102.5.  Jones was one of only three quarterbacks to achieve a 100+ [[passer rating]] during the entire decade of the 1970s, joining [[Dallas Cowboys|Dallas']] [[Roger Staubach]] (1971) and Oakland's [[Ken Stabler]] (1976).  Jones was thus honored by the [[Associated Press]] as 1976's [[NFL Most Valuable Player Award|NFL Most Valuable Player]] and [[NFL Offensive Player of the Year Award|NFL Offensive Player of the Year]], selected All-Pro and named to the [[Pro Bowl]] team.  Jones was also selected 2nd Team All-Pro following the 1977 season.

In 1982, his final season, Bert Jones played in four games for the Los Angeles Rams before a neck injury forced him to retire.

In 1990, Jones participated in the first NFL QB challenge. He finished 1st in the retiree category and 3rd in the regular competition. (The regular competition taking the top 3 finishers from the alumni competition and adding them to the regular field of current QBs). Given his strong performance, Bobby Beathard, then the GM of the Chargers, wanted Jones to come out of retirement. Bert was 39 at the time and chose not to try a comeback.

Bert Jones possessed skills that very few QBs can claim. He called all his own plays and was a true field general unlike most QBs of today. He also possessed one of the strongest arms ever to play in the NFL. Many observers believe that only John Elway, Brett Favre and Doug Williams have had similar arm strength. Bert was reportedly able to throw the ball nearly 100 yards in the air in his prime. The widely respected scout Ernie Accorsi is quoted as saying that if Bert Jones had played under different circumstances, he probably would have been the greatest player ever. John Riggins has been quoted as saying Bert was the toughest competitor he has ever witnessed. On the eve of [[Super Bowl XLII]] New England Patriots head coach [[Bill Belichick]], in discussing his choices for the greatest quarterbacks of all time, described Jones as the best "pure passer" he ever saw.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/08033/854261-66.stm |title=Super Bowl Notebook: Belichick lists Bert Jones as one of his all-time QBs |work=Pittsburgh Post Gazette |accessdate=2008-02-03}}</ref>

== Later Years ==
Jones now owns and operates a [[wood]] treatment facility about fifteen miles from his home in [[Simsboro, Louisiana|Simsboro]], also in [[Lincoln Parish]] west of Ruston.

Jones once hosted ''[[Suzuki's Great Outdoors]]'' on the [[ESPN]] network. He invited his friend [[Grits Gresham]] to appear on three episodes of the series, and Gresham hosted Jones on two episodes of his own ''[[The American Sportsman]]'' on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]].

Jones is a former appointee to the Louisiana Wildlife and Fisheries Commission and is active in environmental and outdoors activities.
