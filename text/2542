'''Bangladesh A''' toured '''England''' in July and August '''2005''' for [[first class cricket|first class]] and [[List A cricket|List A]] [[cricket]] matches against English domestic teams. The team struggled in the first class matches, where they drew two and lost three matches, and only looked like having a chance of winning in the last match against [[Kent County Cricket Club|Kent]]. The one-day series went slightly better, with Bangladesh A winning two, losing one and abandoning a fourth, but for a second string national team against mainly second elevens from English domestic cricket, it was a highly disappointing tour.

====[[British Universities v Bangladesh A 18 July 2005|British Universities v Bangladesh A (18 July)]]====

'''''British Universities beat Bangladesh A by two wickets'''''

In a twelve-a-side match at [[The Parks, Oxford]], a strong [[Bangladesh A cricket team|Bangladesh A]] side including nine internationals went down to a combined universities side, admittedly including two current county professionals. Bangladesh A batted first, and made 249 for 6 in their 50 overs, [[Nafees Iqbal]] top-scoring with 109, while young prodigy [[Mushfiqur Rahim]] also made 50. Bangladesh A proceeded to gift away 35 [[extra (cricket)|extras]] - including 21 in wides - which probably cost them the match, as the Universities passed their score with ten balls remaining. [[Talha Jubair]] and [[Abdur Razzak (cricketer)|Abdur Razzak]] showed promising things with the ball, though, taking four for 50 and two for 37 respectively.

====[[Gloucestershire v Bangladesh A 20-22 July 2005|Gloucestershire v Bangladesh A (20-22 July)]]====

'''''Gloucestershire won by 130 runs'''''

[[Bangladesh A cricket team|Bangladesh A]], still without a win on tour of England, shocked [[Gloucestershire County Cricket Club|Gloucestershire]] initially at [[The County Ground, Bristol|Bristol]]. [[Shahadat Hossain]] took three wickets for the tourists, and [[Syed Rasel]] and [[Talha Jubair]] also chipped in, as Gloucestershire imploded to 72 for 7. However, 83 from wicketkeeper [[Stephen Snell]] lifted them to 232, before [[Jon Lewis]] and [[James Averis]] dug into the tourists to reduce them to 29 for 3. However, [[Tushar Imran]] played his way to his fourth first-class century, a career-best 119, to give the tourists a slender lead of 19 after a 122-run fourth-wicket stand between Tushar and [[Alok Kapali]]. However, Gloucestershire were determined to prove their class the second time around, and after losing [[Kadeer Ali]] for 1 after half an hour they were in control, batting their way to 330 for 5 in just 65.1 overs before [[declaration and forfeiture|declaring]] as [[Alex Gidman]] recorded a 94-ball [[century (cricket)|century]]. Sri Lankan overseas player [[Malinga Bandara]] then took five for 45 with his leg-spin as the tourists imploded from 106 for 2 to 181 all out.

====[[Hampshire v Bangladesh A 24 July 2005|Hampshire v Bangladesh A (24 July)]]====

'''''Match abandoned without a ball bowled'''''

Rain at [[Rose Bowl, Southampton]] prevented [[Bangladesh A cricket team|Bangladesh A]] from playing their third scheduled match on their tour of England, against [[Hampshire County Cricket Club|Hampshire]].

====[[Glamorgan v Bangladesh A 26-28 July 2005|Glamorgan v Bangladesh A (26-28 July)]]====

'''''Match drawn'''''

After a first day where [[Glamorgan County Cricket Club|Glamorgan]] had racked up 380 runs, [[Michael Powell (cricketer)|Michael Powell]] top-scoring with 111 and [[Alex Wharf]] making 77 while [[Syed Rasel]] took four for 89, the touring [[Bangladesh A cricket team|Bangladesh A]] side were sent in to bat. Only 10.1 overs of play was possible on the second day, though, and [[Andrew Davies (cricketer)|Andrew Davies]] took two wickets while [[Alex Wharf]] was taken for 36 runs off just five overs. Day three was rained out, so the match at [[Abergavenny]] ended in a tame draw, with Bangladesh A finishing on 54 for 2.

====Lancashire v Bangladesh A (1 August)====

'''''Bangladesh A won by seven wickets ([[Duckworth-Lewis method|D/L Method]])'''''

[[Lancashire County Cricket Club|Lancashire]] put out a second-string side against Bangladesh A, admittedly including former [[One Day International|ODI]] bowler [[Sajid Mahmood]], and were duly punished by the tourists, who cruised to a seven-wicket victory. Having won the toss, the Bangladeshis chose to bowl at Lancashire, and after [[Andrew Crook]] and [[Iain Sutcliffe]] had put on 35 for the first wicket, [[Shahadat Hossain]] dug out two quick wickets. Lancashire recovered somewhat before rain stopped play for nearly two hours, but when the players returned, Abdur Razzak ran through the middle order. He took three wickets for 25, and Lancashire collapsed to 149, with two run outs. Bangladesh were set 152 to win due to the rain interruption, and the tourists scored slowly before [[Tushar Imran]] came to the crease. Tushar took 91 balls to forge 93 runs, his sixth one-day fifty, as he guided Bangladesh A to a total of 155 for 3 with more than 15 overs remaining in the match.

====[[Yorkshire v Bangladesh A 3-5 August 2005|Yorkshire v Bangladesh A (3-5 August)]]====

'''''Yorkshire won by 126 runs'''''

A second-string [[Yorkshire County Cricket Club|Yorkshire]] pummeled the Bangladeshi bowlers, and despite the short timeframe - three days instead of the County Championship's four - they still got a win. With a run-rate of more than four an over they quickly made their way to 357 for 2 on the first day - [[Matthew Wood (cricketer)|Matthew Wood]] made an unbeaten 202, five short of his career highest score, and shared an opening partnership worth 272 with [[Joe Sayers]]. In reply, [[Tushar Imran]] made his second first-class century on tour, and the fifth of his career, with 116 in a little over three hours, and 19-year-old [[Nazimuddin]] made 60 as the tourists made their way to 325 - left-armer [[David Lucas (cricketer)|David Lucas]] taking five for 49. Yorkshire lost two wickets before stumps to be 48 for 2, but [[Michael John Lumb|Michael Lumb]] made a century on the final day to ensure continued Yorkshire domination as they declared on 240 for 2, setting Bangladesh a target of 273 in three and a half hours. Lucas continued on his fine form from the first innings, taking three wickets, and no Bangladeshi passed 30 as they succumbed for 146 - Lucas took three for 35, fellow left-armer [[David Wainwright (Yorkshire cricketer)|David Wainwright]] took three for 22 with his spin, and even part-time medium-pacer [[Richard Pyrah]] got one wicket in his two overs.

====[[Durham v Bangladesh A 7 August 2005|Durham v Bangladesh A (7 August)]]====

'''''Bangladesh A won by 68 runs'''''

147 from [[Shahriar Nafees]] and [[Nazimuddin]]'s seven-ball 28 - which included three sixes, two fours and a two before he was [[caught and bowled]] off [[Ben Harmison]] - lifted [[Bangladesh A cricket team|Bangladesh A]] to a massive 299 for 6 in 50 overs, despite [[Neil Killeen]] removing [[Tushar Imran]] and [[Alok Kapali]] with successive balls mid-innings. Nafees had paired up with [[Mehrab Hossain]] for 209 for the first wicket. [[Durham County Cricket Club|Durham]] started with a 40-run opening partnership, but [[Syed Rasel]] and [[Shahadat Hossain]] both took two wickets with successive balls, separated by a few overs. Shahadat went on to take four for 34, while Australian [[Callum Thorp]] top-scored with 52 - in vain, as Durham imploded to 213. Durham's captain and opener Lowe ground out 36 runs from 80 deliveries to halt Durham's chase severely.

====[[Surrey v Bangladesh A 10-12 August 2005|Surrey v Bangladesh A (10-12 August)]]====

'''''Match drawn'''''

A [[Surrey County Cricket Club|Surrey]] team including two former internationals - [[English cricket team|England]] batsman [[Mark Butcher]] returning from injury, and the retiring [[Pakistani cricket team|Pakistani]] spin bowler [[Saqlain Mushtaq]] - amassed 336 for 5 before declaring after 74 overs at [[The Oval]]. The internationals made little impact in the first innings, however, as Butcher was [[Caught (cricket)|caught]] for 5 and Saqlain did not bat. [[James Benning (cricketer)|James Benning]] slashed 22 boundaries in his 124 before being [[run out]], and wicketkeeper [[Andrew Hodd]] made an unbeaten 50 in his first [[first class cricket|first-class]] game. [[Bangladesh A cricket team|Bangladesh A]] battled well in reply, equalling Surrey's score before they were bowled out, while [[Saqlain Mushtaq|Saqlain]] got three for 82. [[Tushar Imran]] continued on his rich vein of form, making 70 and top-scoring. [[Scott Newman]] and [[Richard Clinton]] led Surrey to 73 without loss, but two quick wickets from [[Talha Jubair]] turned the game slightly. [[Mark Butcher]] repaired his first innings failure, however, as he made 90 to lead Surrey to 332 for 6 before they declared again. Jubair got four for 99 from an expensive 19 overs. However, the task of surviving 24 overs was easy enough for the tourists, who only lost one wicket, that of [[Shahriar Nafees]] who made a quickfire 63.

====[[Kent v Bangladesh A 16-18 August 2005|Kent v Bangladesh A (16-17 August)]]====

'''''Kent won by three wickets'''''

Eighteen wickets fell on the frantic first day at [[St Lawrence Ground]], and nineteen on the second, as two teams clashed in an interesting, low scoring match that lasted for only 173.4 [[over (cricket)|overs]]. The [[Bangladesh A cricket team|Bangladesh A]] tourists had won the coin toss and chosen to bat, but immediately lost [[Nafees Iqbal]] for a duck. However, [[Tushar Imran]] made 86, and with some help from [[Shahriar Nafees]] (with 30) and [[Nazimuddin]] (27), he took the score to 185. That total did not look challenging, but that was before [[Syed Rasel]]'s medium pace came to the scene. After [[Niall O'Brien]] and [[Neil Dexter]] put on 13 for the first wicket for [[Kent County Cricket Club|Kent]], Rasel and [[Shahadat Hossain]] dug out two wickets each, as Kent lost four wickets for two runs. Rasel took three more wickets before stumps on day one, and two more on the second morning, to end with seven for 50 - the only five-wicket-haul of Bangladesh A on the tour. However, only [[Shahriar Nafees]] passed 20 in the second innings, [[Tushar Imran|Tushar]] lost his golden touch (before this innings, he had made 455 runs at a [[batting average]] of 65) to only scamper 12 runs, while [[Antigua]]n-born [[Robbie Joseph]] took five for 19 with his [[pace bowling]]. Kent were set 188 to win, and lost wickets at regular intervals, but 54 from the first-class debutant Dexter turned out to be crucial as Kent made it with three wickets to spare.
