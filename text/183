'''''Flaming Pie''''' is the tenth studio album by [[Paul McCartney]], first released in 1997. His first studio album in over four years, it was mostly recorded following McCartney's involvement in the highly successful ''[[Beatles Anthology]]'' project.<ref name=BillML/> The album was recorded in several locations over two years, 1995 and 1997, featuring two songs dating from 1992. The album featured several of McCartney's family members and friends. In ''Flaming Pie'''s liner notes, McCartney said: "''[The Beatles Anthology]'' reminded me of The Beatles' standards and the standards that we reached with the songs. So in a way it was a refresher course that set the framework for this album."<ref name=Albumnotes>{{cite album-notes|title=Flaming Pie|artist=[[Paul McCartney]]|year=1997|page=|type=booklet|publisher=[[Parlophone]], [[EMI]]}}</ref>

''Flaming Pie'' peaked at number 2 in both the UK and US, and was [[Gold record|certified gold]]. The album, which was well received by critics, also reached the Top 20 in many other countries. From its release up to mid-2007, the album sold over 1.5 million copies.

==Background==
"[[Calico Skies]]",{{#tag:ref|"Calico Skies" was written when McCartney tried to write something similar to [[the Beatles]]' "[[Blackbird (song)|Blackbird]]".<ref name=W&M146/>|group="nb"}} which [[Paul McCartney]] had written when [[Hurricane Bob]] had hit while McCartney was staying on [[Long Island]] in 1991,<ref name=W&M146/><ref name=BillATP/> and "Great Day", which features backing vocal from  his wife [[Linda McCartney]],<ref name=BillATP/> hailed from a 1992 session,{{#tag:ref|Also recorded during this session is the unreleased song "When Winter Comes".<ref>{{cite web|title=The McCartney Recording Sessions - 1992|url=http://webpages.charter.net/ram71/1992.htm|accessdate=5 April 2013}}</ref>|group="nb"}}<ref name=W&M146/> recorded even before ''[[Off the Ground]]'' had come out. Starting from the mid-1990s for four years, McCartney was involved in ''[[The Beatles Anthology]]'', a documentary on the history of [[the Beatles]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Miles |first=Barry |authorlink=Barry Miles |title=[[Paul McCartney: Many Years from Now]] |year=1997 |publisher=Henry Holt & Company |edition=1st Hardcover |isbn=978-0-8050-5248-0 |pages=218<U+2013>219}}</ref> During 1995, as the ''Anthology'' albums were starting to be released over a two-year period, [[EMI]] did not want McCartney to release a solo album in the meantime.<ref name=BillML/> McCartney said that he "was almost insulted at first" before then realising that "it would be silly to go out against yourself in the form of the Beatles. So I fell in with the idea and thought, 'Great, I don't even have to think about an album.'"<ref name=BillML/> McCartney was occupied with working on ''[[Standing Stone (album)|Standing Stone]]'' in the interim.<ref name=BillML/>

==Recording and structure==
Beginning in February 1995, McCartney teamed up with [[Jeff Lynne]],<ref name=ALife306/> [[Electric Light Orchestra]] lead singer and guitarist, an ardent Beatles fan. Lynne had previously worked with former Beatle [[George Harrison]] on his 1987 album ''[[Cloud Nine (George Harrison album)|Cloud Nine]]'' and also co-produced "[[Free as a Bird]]" and "[[Real Love (John Lennon song)|Real Love]]" for the ''Anthology'' project. Intending to produce something pure and easy <U+2014> and without elaborate productions <U+2014> McCartney sporadically recorded the entire album in a space of two years, working not only with Lynne, but with [[Steve Miller (musician)|Steve Miller]],{{#tag:ref|Miller and McCartney had worked together once before, on 1969's "My Dark Hour" at Abbey Road Studios.<ref name=BillML/> After finding out his son, James, was a fan of Miller, McCartney decided to renew their friendship.<ref name=BillML/>|group="nb"}} [[George Martin]], [[Ringo Starr]] and his own son, [[James McCartney]],<ref name=BillML/> who plays lead guitar on "Heaven on a Sunday".<ref name=BillATP/> McCartney wrote the song "[[Young Boy]]" while his wife Linda was making lunch for a ''[[New York Times]]'' feature on 18 August 1994.<ref name=W&M146>{{cite book|last=Benitez|first=Vincent P.|title=The Words and Music of Paul McCartney: The Solo Years|year=2010|publisher=Praeger|location=Santa Barbara, Calif.|isbn=9780313349690|page=146}}</ref> McCartney and Miller started recording "Young Boy" on 22 February 1995 in [[Sun Valley, Idaho]].<ref name=W&M146/> They reconvened a few months afterwards in May at McCartney's home studio, [[Hogg Hill Mill, Icklesham|The Mill]], recording <U+2013> a song described as a "road song" <U+2013> "If You Wanna" and the [[Jam (music)|jam]] track "Used to Be Bad" in the process.<ref name=BillML/><ref name=MRS95>{{cite web|title=The McCartney Recording Sessions - 1995|url=http://webpages.charter.net/ram71/1995.htm|accessdate=5 April 2013}}</ref> 

The duo also recorded the B-side "Broomstick" and three unreleased tracks: "(Sweet Home) Country Girl", "Soul Boy", and an untitled song.<ref name=MRS95/> Also in May, McCartney, by himself, recorded the unreleased tracks "Stella May Day", for his daughter [[Stella McCartney]], which would be used playing over loudspeakers at her fashion shows, and "Whole Life" with [[David A.
