Muchhal became a member of [[Kalyanji-Anandji]] Little Star, a group of young singers, when she was four years old.<ref name=rediff >{{cite web|title=rediff.com: Indore's Palak Muchal sings for a cause |url=http://m.rediff.com/news/2000/jul/14rahul.htm |publisher=Rediff.com |date=14 July 2000 |accessdate=12 April 2013}}</ref> During the [[Kargil War]] of 1999, when aged seven, she spent a week singing at shops in her home city, Indore, to raise funds for the families of deceased Indian soldiers. Her efforts received substantial coverage in Indian media and she raised {{INR}}25,000 (US$810). Later that year, she sang to raise funds for victims of the [[1999 Odisha cyclone]].<ref name=BBC>{{cite web|title= India's life-saving child singer <U+2013> BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/3081620.stm|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=8 September 2003|accessdate=10 April 2013}}</ref>

Her decision to use her voice to help others was triggered when she saw poor children using their clothes to clean train compartments.<ref name="MightyHeart" /> Around the same time, teachers at Nidhi Vinay Mandir, an Indore based school, approached Muchhal and her parents with a request for a charity show to raise funds for their pupil, Lokesh, who was suffering from a [[congenital heart defect]]. His father was impoverished footwear shop-owner and was unable to afford the high cost of heart surgery. Muchhal and her parents agreed to arrange a show and in March 2000, she used a street vendor's cart as a stage for the event and collected {{INR}}51,000 (US$1,600) towards the cost of surgery. The attendant publicity prompted renowned [[Bangalore]]-based [[cardiologist]], [[Devi Prasad Shetty]], to operate on Lokesh free of charge. Muchhal's parents published advertisements in local newspapers to promote donations toward heart surgery for children like Lokesh. The outcome of this was a list of 33 children in need of heart surgery.<ref name=IndiaToday>{{cite web|title=Offtrack: Indore, Madhya Pradesh: Tunes that Count |url=http://www.india-today.com/itoday/20000731/offtrack.html |work=[[India Today]] |date=31 July 2000 |accessdate=10 April 2013}}</ref>

A series of charity shows were arranged later in that year, from which {{INR}}225,000 (US$7,200) were raised. This money was used to provide heart surgery for five children in Bangalore and Indore hospitals. To help Muchhal in her efforts to save lives of children at relatively low cost, T. Choithram Hospital of Indore halved the cost of surgery from {{INR}}80,000 (US$2,600) to {{INR}}40,000 (US$1,300) and one of its surgeons, Dhiraj Gandhi, decided to waive his fee for cases brought in by Muchhal.<ref name="rediff" />
