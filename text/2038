'''''Aquaman''''' is a television [[television pilot|pilot]] developed by ''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]]'' creators [[Alfred Gough|Al Gough]] and [[Miles Millar]] for [[The WB Television Network]], based on the [[DC Comics]] character [[Aquaman]]. Gough and Miller wrote the pilot, which was directed by [[Greg Beeman]]. [[Justin Hartley]] starred as Arthur "A.C." Curry, a young man living in a beachside community in the Florida Keys who learns about his powers and destiny as the Prince of [[Atlantis]].

The ''Aquaman'' pilot was expected to debut in the fall of 2006, but following the merger of the WB and [[UPN]], the resulting [[The CW Television Network|CW Network]] opted not to buy the series. After they passed on the pilot, it was made available online through [[iTunes]] in the United States and became the number-one most downloaded television show on iTunes. It received generally favorable reviews and was later released on other online markets, and aired on Canadian television network [[YTV (TV channel)|YTV]].

==Production==
===Development===
The concept of ''Aquaman'' stemmed from a [[Smallville (season 5)|fifth season]] episode of ''Smallville'', "[[Smallville (season 5)#Aqua|Aqua]]".  The episode featured Arthur Curry ([[Alan Ritchson]]) coming to Smallville to stop an underwater weapons project being developed by [[LuthorCorp]].  "Aqua" became the highest rated episode for ''Smallville'' that season, but it was never meant to be a [[Television pilot#Backdoor pilots|backdoor pilot]] for an ''Aquaman'' series.<ref name="aqua">{{cite web|url=http://www.superherohype.com/news.php?id=3627|title=The WB Makes Aquaman Official|date=[[2006-11-13]]|publisher=SuperHeroHype.com|accessdate=2007-01-05}}</ref> However, as work progressed on "Aqua", the character was recognized to have potential for his own series.<ref name="background">{{cite news|author=Josef Adalian|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117932862.html?categoryid=1236&cs=1|title=WB dives into 'Aquaman'|publisher=Variety|date=[[2005-11-13]]|accessdate=2007-01-01}}</ref>  Miles Millar and Alfred Gough, the creators of ''Smallville'', also considered a series featuring [[Lois Lane]], but felt stronger about Aquaman.<ref name="background"/> Millar said,"[''Aquaman''] was the first idea where we really thought we had a franchise, where we could see 100 episodes."<ref name="background"/>

Alan Ritchson was not considered for the role in the new series, because Gough and Millar did not consider it a  [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] from ''Smallville''.

==Pilot summary==
[[Image:ACswim.jpg|thumb|right|A.C. swims at superhuman speeds]]
A.C. and his mother Atlanna are flying over the [[Bermuda Triangle]]. As they get closer, Atlanna's necklace begins to glow and a surge of light and energy erupts from the ocean, causing [[cyclone]]s which bring their plane down. Atlanna is kidnapped by a [[siren]], but not before giving A.C. her necklace and calling him Orin. Ten years later, A.C. is charged for releasing [[dolphin]]s from a [[marine park]]. His father bails him out of trouble, but gives him a stern lecture on responsibility. Later, A.C. tells his friend Eva that he felt like the dolphins were calling to him. While he's working, he is approached by a lighthouse keeper who identifies himself as McCaffery. The [[Coast guard|Coast Guard]] picks up an unidentified man, floating in the Bermuda Triangle and pleading to warn Orin. Lt. Torres is sent to investigate the area. A.C. is also at the Triangle, and his necklace triggers another surge of light, which causes Torres to crash her [[Jet aircraft|jet]]. Brigman transports the John Doe to another facility, and persuades Torres to join his team.  Brigman is looking for a connection between the disappearances of thousands of individuals, and their reappearance years later without ever aging a day. 

That evening, A.C. meets Nadia and she convinces him to go swimming. In the water, Nadia reveals herself to not only be a Siren, but the one that took his mother. A.C. barely escapes with a little help from McCaffery.  McCaffery explains that he, Arthur and Arthur's mother were all exiles from [[Atlantis]], and that A.C. is the prince of Atlantis. Arthur convinces Eva to leave Tempest Key for a few days, but it comes too late as Nadia injures Eva and captures Arthur. When he wakes up, A.C. finds that Nadia has also captured McCaffery and she is bringing them both back to Atlantis to be executed. After breaking free, A.C. destroys Nadia by putting a spear through her head. The next morning, McCaffery explains that there will be more creatures that will come looking for A.C. and that he should have started his training years prior. A.C. agrees to start his training, and McCaffery leaves him with ''[[Henry IV, Part 1|Henry IV Part 1]]'' and ''[[Henry IV, Part 2|Part 2]]'' to read. McCaffery informs Arthur, who isn't too keen on having to read the books, "It isn't about the ending, it's about the journey."

Ideas for future episodes focused on environmental threats, such as "ocean polluters" and "evil oil companies."<ref name="ing">{{cite web|url=http://au.tv.ign.com/articles/666/666474p1.html|title=The WB Reels in Aquaman|date=[[2006-11-14]]|publisher=IGN|accessdate=2007-01-01}}</ref> The first 13 episodes already planned out, with a possible story arc involving McCaffery being captured and taken back to Atlantis.<ref name="interviewi">{{cite web|url=http://ifmagazine.com/feature.asp?article=1904|title=Exclusive Interview: Smallville co-creator Alfred Gough talks season six and Mercy Reef - part 2|author=Anthony C.
