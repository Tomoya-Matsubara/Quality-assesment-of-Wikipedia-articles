==Brent Knoll Hill==

The hill consists of clays and limestone from the [[Jurassic]] era and geologically forms an outcrop of the nearby [[Mendip Hills]].<ref name="brentknollhist">{{cite web | url=http://www.brentknollvillage.info/history.htm |title=A Brief History of Brent Knoll Village | publisher=Brent Knoll Village | accessdate=20 January 2011}}</ref>

Before the Somerset Levels were drained, Brent Knoll was an island, known as the Isle (or Mount) of Frogs, that provided a safe haven from the water and marshes.<ref>{{cite web | title=Brent Knoll (Sacred sites around Glastonbury) | work=Isle of Avalon | url= http://www.isleofavalon.co.uk/sacredsites/brentknoll.html | accessdate=19 January 2011}}</ref> It temporarily became an island again during the [[Bristol Channel floods, 1607|Bristol Channel floods of 1607]].

There is a small reservoir on the south east flank of the knoll.

==History==

===Bronze and Iron Ages===

[[Image:Brent Knoll Somerset Map.jpg|thumb|left|Earthworks at Brent Knoll]]
Brent Knoll has seen human settlement since at least the [[Bronze Age]], becoming an Iron Age Fort about 2,000BC,<ref name="villagewebsite"/> which covers covers an area of {{convert|1.6|ha|m2}}. It is defended by a single wall around {{convert|10|cm|in}} high and by a single ditch, with an entrance on the eastern side,<ref name="adkins"/> with a second bank on the north east side.<ref name="her-brentknoll"/> It is surrounded by multiple ramparts (''multivallate'') following the contours of the hill, however these have been heavily damaged by cattle and [[quarrying]].<ref name="adkins">{{cite book |last=Adkins |first=Lesley and Roy |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=A field Guide to Somerset Archeology |year=1992 | pages=29-30|publisher=Dovecote press |location=Stanbridge |isbn=0946159947 }}</ref>

===Roman=== 

The Romans used its summit as a fortification. An [[urn]] containing coins of the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] Emperors [[Trajan]] and [[Severus]] was found at the site before 1790. Other finds have included pennant sandstone roof tiles and painted wall plaster indicative of a substantial building which is more likely to have been a temple than a villa. Many of the finds are in the [[Somerset County Museum|Somerset County]] and [[North Somerset Museum]]s, with [[Romano-British]] pottery in the [[Blake Museum]], [[Bridgwater]].<ref name="her-brentknoll"/>

===Anglo-Saxon===

The fort has been claimed as the site of [[Mons Badonicus]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Brent Knoll Hillfort.|url=http://digitaldigging.co.uk/maps/hillforts/somerset/hill-forts-somerset-brent-knoll-hillfort.html|publisher=Digital Digging|accessdate=19 January 2011}}</ref> This was a battle between a force of [[Britons (historical)|Britons]] and an [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] army, probably sometime between 490 and 517 AD.<ref>Ashe, Geoffrey, ''From Caesar to Arthur'' pp.295-8</ref> Though it is believed to have been a major political and military event, there is no certainty about its date or place.

It is also believed to be the site of a battle in 875 at which forces of the [[Anglo-Saxon]] kingdom of [[Wessex]] drove away the  the [[Great Heathen Army]] led by [[Guthrum]],<ref name="brentknollhist"/> prior to the [[Treaty of Wedmore]] which was signed three years later.
