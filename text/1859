==Financing==
The development is linked to a $500m affordable mortgage scheme.<ref name="Financier" /> The ''[[Washington Post]]'' reports that Rawabi "is specifically designed for upwardly mobile families of a sort that in the United States might gravitate to places such as [[Reston, Virginia|Reston, VA]]. The developments are also relying on another American import, the home mortgage, including creation of a Fannie Mae-style institution for the West Bank".<ref name="Schneider">{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/11/22/AR2009112202106.html?hpid=moreheadlines|title=Palestinians looking to U.S.-style suburban housing, financing|last=Schneider|first=Howard|date=23 November 2009|work=[[Washington Post]]|accessdate=15 December 2009}}</ref>

==Master plan==
The Rawabi master plan was developed by [[AECOM]], in cooperation with local experts from [[Birzeit University|Birzeit]] and [[An-Najah National University|An-Najah National]] Universities and the technical teams of Bayti.<ref name="Masterplan"/> It has been approved by the Palestinian Authority and the Palestinian Higher Planning Council.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.menafn.com/qn_news_story_s.asp?storyid=1093287839|title=Diar gets nod for Palestine project|date=11 December 2009|publisher=MENAFN|accessdate=5 January 2010}}</ref> 

The residential areas will surround a [[city centre]] that includes [[bank]]s, [[retail|shop]]s, [[petrol station]]s, [[office]]s, eight [[school]]s, [[playground]]s, [[walking trail]]s, two [[mosque]]s, a [[church (building)|church]], a [[hospital]], [[hotel]], [[Movie theater|cinema]] and numerous other arts venues.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rawabi.ps/live.php?link=0&page=live|title=Live in Rawabi|publisher=Rawabi|accessdate=3 October 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www2.opic.gov/environasp/eia/amal_rawabi/Rawabi%20EIA%20Final%20-%20KCR.pdf|title=Environmental impact assessment for the new city of Rawabi|author=Projects Unit (ANUPU), An-Najah National University|publisher=Palestinian National Authority Environmental Quality Authority|date=January 2010|page=33|accessdate=3 October 2010}}</ref>

==Greening project==
Thousands of [[sapling]]s are being planted as part of a [[greening]] project which involves growing a forest around the city.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.greenprophet.com/2009/12/06/14196/rawabi-palestine-planned-city/|title=Planned city 'Rawabi' draws on Palestinian enterprise and Israeli experience|last=Media Line|date=6 December 2009|publisher=Green Prophet|accessdate=29 April 2010}}</ref> The [[Jewish National Fund]] is donating 3,000 saplings to the project, the announcement of which sparked some internal Israeli and [[Jew]]ish controversy.<ref name="Jpost">{{cite news

==Access roads==
Only in Janauary 2012 an access road for trucks was approved<ref>[http://www.ctv.ca/CTVNews/World/20120205/palestinian-city-of-rawabi-planned-in-west-bank-120205/ A new Palestinian city rises in the West Bank.] [[CTV News]], Feb. 5 2012</ref>, shortly before a visit by [[UN Secretary General]] [[Ban Ki-moon]].<ref>[http://abcnews.go.com/meta/search/imageDetail?format=plain&source=http://abcnews.go.com/images/International/e2071df0d5ca438abd47888cec887b2a ABC News], 2 February 2012</ref> The access road for inhabitants still needs to be approved. It needs to pass through [[Administrative divisions of the Oslo Accords|Area 'C']]<ref>[http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/week-s-end/building-the-palestinian-dream-on-shaky-ground-1.375916 Building the Palestinian Dream, [[Haaretz]]]</ref><ref>[http://www.jpost.com/Features/FrontLines/Article.aspx?id=244336 West Bank: Build it and they will come.] Jerusalem Post, 4 November 2011</ref> and cross Route 465, used only by inhabitants of nearby [[Israeli settlements]] [[Ateret]] and [[Halamish]]. 

==Land purchase and water supply==
Over the course of two years, the developers bought private property from 2,000 families living in Canada, Iraq, Spain, Kuwait, Britain, Portugal and Italy. The source of the city's water supply is not yet clear. One possibility is hooking up to [[Mekorot]], the Israeli water utility, via Ateret.<ref name="haaretz building dream" />

==Controversy==
In 2010, Israeli settlers held demonstrations to protest the project, although they acknowledged that they could not prevent the city's construction.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel/Article.aspx?id=176092|title=Hundreds protest new PA city|work=The Jerusalem Post|date=21 May 2010|accessdate=22 February 2011}}</ref> Some settlers said they would establish settlements nearby.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.jpost.com/Home/Article.aspx?id=172193|title=Settler activists claim area near Rawabi|first=Tovah|last=Lazaroff|work=The Jerusalem Post|date=1 April 2010|accessdate=22 February 2011}}</ref>

In December 2010, the Palestinian [[Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions|Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions National Committee]] raised concerns about the involvement of Israeli contractors in the project.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://electronicintifada.net/v2/article11706.shtml|title=Role of Israeli firms raises boycott concerns about Rawabi|first=Ali|last=Abunimah|work=The Electronic Intifada|date=30 December 2010|accessdate=22 February 2011}}</ref> [[Ali Abunimah]], co-founder of [[The Electronic Intifada]], a website that covers the Arab-Israeli conflict from a Palestinian perspective, has argued that through the development of Rawabi, Bashar Masri "appears to be actively helping Israel deepen its hold on the Palestinian economy despite his earlier claims that he is trying to help end this relationship". Abunimah argues that Masri "appears to have made the choice to work closely with the Israeli government and businesses in order to bring even more Israeli companies into the occupied West Bank", whereas Masri himself claims that his decision to use Israeli businesses was a matter of necessity given Israeli restrictions on Palestinian economic activity.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://electronicintifada.net/v2/article11717.shtml|title=Rawabi developer Masri helps deepen Israel's grip on West Bank|first=Ali|last=Abunimah|work=The Electronic Intifada|date=6 January 2011|accessdate=21 February 2011}}</ref> Masri has made it a requirement that all contractors working on the project "sign an agreement refusing to use Israeli products originating from the settlements or work in the settlements themselves".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thenational.ae/thenationalconversation/comment/economic-peace-betrays-the-hand-of-a-grasping-israeli-right|title='Economic peace' betrays the hand of a grasping Israeli right|first=Jonathan|last=Cook|work=The National|date=1 February 2011|accessdate=22 February 2011}}</ref>
