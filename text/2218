'''Krokos''' is a small Greek town of 5.000 inhabitants, only 5&nbsp;km south of the city of [[Kozani]]. It was the seat of the municipality of [[Elimeia]]. Krokos has a modern telecommunications infrastructure, including broadband internet availability by means of [[ADSL]].

==Krokos Kozanis (Saffron)==

Krokos is renowned in Greece and abroad for the production of the Greek Macedonian [[Saffron]], which is one of the world's most intense and valuable varieties.
Although the ancient [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]]s were known to cultivate saffron during Late Bronze Age Crete, the cultivation of the plant disappeared from Greece until about 300 years ago, when Greek [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonian]] traders brought the plant from [[Austria]] to the region of [[Kozani]].  The town of Krokos is the base of the Cooperative of Saffron Producers of Kozani, a cooperative that counts 2000 members spread between 40 small villages.
Annual production, depending on weather conditions, ranges from 6 to 12 tons of pure red saffron each year. Much of this production is [[certified organic]]. All of it is [[Protected Designation of Origin]] (PDO); no other region of Greece can produce Greek Red Saffron. It is also extremely high-quality: Greek Red Saffron, as provided by the Kozani Cooperative, has a guaranteed coloring strength of 230.
