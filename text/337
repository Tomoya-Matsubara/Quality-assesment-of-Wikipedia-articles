'''''R (Bancoult) v Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (No 2)''''' was a case of the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]] concerning the removal of the [[Chagossians|Chagos Islanders]] and the exercise of the [[Royal Prerogative in the United Kingdom|Royal Prerogative]]. The [[Chagos Islands]], acquired by the United Kingdom in 1814, were reorganised as the British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT) in 1965 for the purpose of removing its inhabitants. Under a 1971 [[Order-in-Council]], the Chagossians were forcibly removed, and the central island of [[Diego Garcia]] leased to the [[United States]] for use as a military outpost. In 2000 [[Louis Olivier Bancoult|Olivier Bancoult]] brought a [[Judicial review in English law|judicial review]] claim against the [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs]] for the initial ordinance which led to the Chagossian removal. Bancoult sought a writ of ''[[certiorari]]'' on the grounds that the ordinance was ''[[ultra vires]]'' (outside the law), a claim upheld by both the [[Divisional Court (England and Wales)|Divisional Court]] and the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]]. In response, [[Robin Cook]], the Foreign Secretary, repealed the 1971 Order-in-Council and announced he would not appeal against the decision, allowing the Chagossians to return home.

In 2004, a second Order-in-Council, the British Indian Ocean Territory (Constitution) Order 2004, was produced, again reinstating the off-limits nature of the Chagos Islands. Bancoult brought a second case, arguing that this Order was again ''ultra vires'' and unreasonable, and that Cook had violated [[legitimate expectation]] by passing the second Order after giving the impression that the Chagossians were free to return home. The new Order was again struck down by the Divisional Court and Court of Appeal before proceeding to the House of Lords where it was heard by Lords [[Leonard Hoffmann, Baron Hoffmann|Hoffmann]], [[Thomas Bingham, Baron Bingham of Cornhill|Bingham]], [[Alan Rodger, Baron Rodger of Earlsferry|Rodger]], [[Robert Carswell, Baron Carswell|Carswell]] and [[Jonathan Mance, Baron Mance|Mance]] between 30 June and 3 July 2008. In their judgment, issued on 22 October 2008, the Lords decided by a 3-2 majority to uphold the new Order-in-Council, stating that it was valid and, although judicial review actions could look at Orders-in-Council, the national security and foreign relations issues in the case barred them from doing so. In addition, Cook's statement had not been clear and unambiguous enough to provide legitimate expectation.

The reaction to the decision was a negative one,<ref name=p1/> with academics accusing the Lords of failing to do their job as members of the judiciary to "rework things like neo-imperial texts and outdated legal attitudes to the prerogative in order to cure obvious injustices and to vindicate a modern conception of the rule of law";<ref name=p1/> at the same time, their approach to legitimate expectation was also questioned, with the case described as an "unfortunate regression" from ''[[Council of Civil Service Unions v Minister for the Civil Service]]'', where judges were willing to debate legitimate expectation in a similarly politically sensitive situation.<ref name=c/>

==Background==
===Chagos Islands===
[[File:Diegogarcia.jpg|thumb|right|[[Diego Garcia]], now the site of an important US armed forces base.]]
The [[Chagos Islands]] are a cluster of 60 islands and seven [[atolls]] in the [[Indian Ocean]]. First occupied by lepers from the [[Mauritius]], France aquired the islands in the late 18th century, and slaves were brought in from Africa and India to maintain coconut plantations placed there. Following [[Napoleon]]'s defeat in 1814, the islands were ceded to the [[United Kingdom|British]] in the [[Treaty of Paris (1814)|Treaty of Paris]],<ref>Poole (2010) p.149</ref> who administered them as a dependency of the colonial Mauritius.<ref>Jeffery (2006) p.229</ref> Although the slaves were given their freedom in 1835, many remained on the Chagos Islands as contract workers, and are considered the indigenous people - the Chagossians. In 1965, the British government reconstituted the islands as the British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT) through the British Indian Ocean Territory Order 1965, a [[statutory instrument]] under the [[Colonial Boundaries Act 1895]]. This instrument created the office of "Commissioner of BIOT", who was allowed to "make laws for the peace, order and good government of the territory". As part of this, the Commissioner passed the Immigration Ordinance 1971, an [[Order-in-Council]] under the [[Royal Prerogative in the United Kingdom|Royal Prerogative]] which required anyone entering or remaining in BIOT to seek permission beforehand.<ref>Elliott (2009) p.697</ref> 

This ordinance, and the reorganisation of the islands, was enacted to provide a method for removing the [[Chagossian|Chagos Islanders]] so that the islands could be used by the [[United States]] as a military base, particularly the island of [[Diego Garcia]]. From 1964 onwards the United States and United Kingdom had been in talks about leasing Diego Garcia to the US for military purposes, and by an [[exchange of notes]] dated 30 December 1966, the UK government transferred Diego Garcia to the US for the purpose of hosting a defensive communications base. This agreement was to last for 50 years, with an additional 20 year extension if neither party wished to withdraw.<ref>Allen  (2007) p.443</ref> Between 1967 and 1972 all 1,600 islanders were evacuated,<ref>Sand (2009) p.317</ref> and Diego Garcia continues to play a vital role in US military operations.<ref>Cohn (2009) p.264</ref> Following a billion-dollar expansion program, the base has served as a "bomber forward operating location" for offensive operations in Afghanistan and Iraq.<ref>Sand (2009) p.318</ref> A US State Department letter dated 21 June 2000 described it as an "all but indispensable platform".<ref>Nauvel (2006) p.97</ref>

===Bancoult (No 1)===
In 2000, Olivier Bancoult, a native Chagossian and leader of the Chagos Refugees Group,<ref>Jeffery (2006) p.230</ref> brought a [[Judicial review in English law|judicial review]] claim against the [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs]] for the initial ordinance which led to the Chagossian removal. Bancoult sought a writ of ''[[certiorari]]'' on the grounds that the ordinance was ''[[ultra vires]]'' and failed the ''[[Wednesbury unreasonableness|Wednesbury]]'' test of reasonableness, as it was irrational. The case, ''R (Bancoult) v Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs'', went to the [[Divisional Court (England and Wales)|Divisional Court]], where it was heard by [[Richard Gibbs (judge)|Gibbs J]] and [[John Laws (judge)|Laws LJ]].<ref>McBride p.190</ref> Bancoult's argument was made on several grounds; firstly, that the Crown could not exclude a British citizen from British territory, except in times of war, without a valid statutory basis or prerogative power. Secondly, the Chagossians had a constitutional right to inhabit their land under the [[Magna Carta]], one which could not be abridged with delegated legislation, and third, the Commissioner of BIOT's duty to legislate "for the peace, order and good government" of BIOT's inhabitants could not be said to be fulfilled by relocating those inhabitants.<ref>Nauvel p.103</ref>

The respondent, the [[Foreign & Commonwealth Office]] (FCO), argued that the English courts had no jurisdiction over the case, since the Crown is divisible amongst its territories, and the BIOT had its own courts. According to the FCO, Magna Carta, as a British constitutional document, was inapplicable to the Chagos Islands. They also maintained that "make laws for the peace, order and good government of the Territory" gave the Commissioner a wide enough jurisdiction to account for the order forcibly removing the Chagossians, and that the court could not decide in such a way as to force the government to break its treaty with the United States.<ref>Nauvel p.104</ref> The Divisional Court gave its judgment on 3 November 2000, on three main issues; firstly, the court's right to hear the case, secondly, the Chagossians' constitutional right of residence and thirdly, the status of the Commissioner's actions. The court found that they did have discretion to hear the case, since while the Crown was divisible, the actions of the BIOT were clearly the actions of the British government, since every BIOT action was ordered and dealt with by the Foreign & Commonwealth Office. Laws LJ found that the Magna Carta did apply to foreign nations, as it was "the nearest approach to an irreplaceable 'fundamental statute' that England has ever had... For in brief it means this, that the King is and shall be below the law". This did not alone validate Bancoult's case, since it did not mean that the government's actions were illegal.<ref>Nauvel p.105</ref>

The final section of the judgment was on the legality of the Commissioner's 1971 ordinance. Laws LJ held that it was "elementary" that "a legislature created by a measure passed by a body which is legally prior to it must act within the confines of the power thereby conferred"; in this case that the Commissioner's jurisdiction was to legislate "for the peace, order and good government" of BIOT. While the latitude given to the Commissioner was wide, it "may be a very large tapestry, but every tapestry has a border".<ref>Palmer (2001) p.236</ref> The court found that in the 1971 ordinance, the Commissioner had exceeded his authority, and the ordinance was made ''ultra vires''. As such, the ordinance was quashed.<ref>Nauvel p.106</ref>

===Government response===
In response to the Divisional Court's decision, [[Robin Cook]], the Foreign Secretary, stated on 3 November 2000 that he would accept the ruling, issuing the Immigration Ordinance 2000 which repealed the 1971 ordinance in its entirety. Due to "security issues", the British government was only prepared to let the Chagossians return to the outer islands, which were lacking in basic amenities - as such, a "feasibility study" was conducted. The preliminary study was produced on 20 June 2000, and the full study published on 10 July 2002.<ref>Nauvel p.111</ref> It concluded that:{{quotation|anything other than short-term resettlement on a purely subsistence basis would be highly precarious and would involve expensive underwriting by the UK Government for an open-ended period - probably permanently. Accordingly, the Government considers that there would be no purpose in commissioning any further study into the feasibility of resettlement; and that it would be impossible for the Government to promote or even permit resettlement to take place. After long and careful consideration we have therefore decided to legislate to prevent it.<ref>Allen (2008) p.685</ref>}}

On 1 June 2004, a second [[Order-in-Council]] was produced (the British Indian Ocean Territory (Constitution) Order 2004), Section 9 of which provided that "no person has the right of abode in the territory" and "no person is entitled to enter or be present in the territory except as authorised by or under this Order or any other law for the time being in force in the territory". At the same time, the British Indian Ocean Territory (Immigration) Order 2004 came into effect, prohibiting entry or presence in BIOT without a permit. In response, Bancoult brought a second case, claiming that Cook's statement created [[legitimate expectation]] (later frustrated by the 2004 orders) and questioning the validity of the Constitution Order 2004, particularly the legality of Section 9.<ref>McBride p.191</ref>

==Judgment==
The case first went to the Divisional Court, where [[Anthony Hooper|Hooper LJ]] and [[Peter Cresswell (judge)|Cresswell J]] decided in favour of Bancoult on 11 May 2006. The court found that the "interests of BIOT must be or must primarily be those whose right of abode and unrestricted right to enter and remain was being in effect removed", and that as Section 9 of the Constitutional Order did not serve the interests of it or its inhabitants, it was irrational. At the same time, the court was asked to rule on whether an Order-in-Council could be questioned in judicial review proceedings. They decided that under ''[[Council of Civil Service Unions v Minister for the Civil Service]]'', the decisive element was not the origin of the power (in this case, the Royal Prerogative) but the nature of the power. As such, Orders-in-Council were subject to judicial review.<ref>Allen (2007) p.445</ref> This decision was appealed to the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales]], composed of [[Elizabeth Butler-Sloss, Baroness Butler-Sloss|Butler-Sloss]], [[Stephen Sedley|Sedley]] and [[David Neuberger, Baron Neuberger of Abbotsbury|Neuberger LJJ]], who agreed with the Divisional Court in their judgment issued on 23 May 2007.<ref>Sand (2009) p.319</ref>

===House of Lords===
The case was then taken to the House of Lords, where it was heard by Lords [[Leonard Hoffmann, Baron Hoffmann|Hoffmann]], [[Thomas Bingham, Baron Bingham of Cornhill|Bingham]], [[Alan Rodger, Baron Rodger of Earlsferry|Rodger]], [[Robert Carswell, Baron Carswell|Carswell]] and [[Jonathan Mance, Baron Mance|Mance]]. The litigation occurred between 30 June and 3 July 2008, and a judgment was issued on 22 October 2008.<ref>Allen (2008) p.684</ref> The judgment covered two matters; whether or not the courts could subject Orders-in-Council to judicial review, and the legality of the 2004 Order. The Lords unanimously agreed that while Orders-in-Council were pieces of primary legislation, similar to Acts of Parliament (which cannot be subject to judicial review), there is a significant difference in that Orders-in-Council are an executive product, and lack the "representative character" that comes with Parliamentary authority and approval. As such, the Lords saw "no reason why prerogative legislation should not be subject to review on ordinary principles of legality, rationality and procedural impropriety in the same way as any other executive action".<ref>Poole (2010) p.150</ref>

In a 3-2 decision, the Lords upheld the legality of the Constitutional Order, including Section 9. Lords Hoffmann, Rodger and Carswell, in the majority, held that BIOT was a "conquered or ceded colony", and as such subject to the prerogative powers of the Crown. They rejected the principle that there was a constitutional right to reside in one's own country, citing it as "extreme", and concluded that this right could not trump legislation such as Orders-in-Council.<ref>Sand (2009) p.320</ref> The phrase "peace, order and good government" should be understood as referring not only to the inhabitants of BIOT, but to the governance of the region. The wording is to be treated "as apt to confer plenary lawmaking authority", and that the matter of reviewing the Order was for the government and Parliament to decide, not for the courts, since it is a political issue of national security and foreign relations.<ref>Poole (2010) p.151</ref> At the same time, there was no legitimate expectation created following Bancoult (No 1). The standard requirement for legitimate expectation, as decided in ''[[R v North and East Devon Health Authority, ex parte Coughlan]]'', was that there must be a "clear and unambiguous" promise made that led to a reliance or a detriment; Robin Cook's statement after the first Bancoult case could not be described as a clear and unambiguous promise of resettlement, and the requirements of reliance and detriment were not met.<ref name=mc/>

Lords Bingham and Mance, dissenting, took the view that the Order-in-Council was unreasonable and invalid. Bingham noted that the proper way to interpret an exercise of the royal prerogative was to look at how it was exercised previously, and that he could not find any previous record of the prerogative being used to "exile an indigenous population from its homeland"; he argued that this prerogative power did not exist; "[t]he Crown has never had a prerogative power to prevent its subjects from entering the Kingdom, or to expel them from it".<ref>McBride p.192</ref> As such, the Order was ''ultra vires''. Bingham also maintained that it was irrational, since visits to the outer islands did not threaten US security, and unacceptable, in that no consideration had been given to the Chagossians. On the subject of legitimate expectation, the dissenters maintained that the statement should be "construed according to the ordinary meaning that would be attached to it by those, principally the Chagossians and their supporters, to whom it was directed"; Bingham saw the ordinary meaning as being that the Chagossians would be allowed to return home.<ref name=mc>McBride p.194</ref>

==Significance==
The ''Bancoult'' case was the first one to directly state that in cases of legitimate expectation, the information must be relied on, leading to a detriment. In prior cases it was simply an additional element, and not explicitly required. At the same time, it raised questions about the oversight of Orders-in-Council, given that it highlighted the courts are unwilling to review a piece of executive legislation where there are political elements in play. The decision also raised "the classic problem of balancing human rights issues and concerns relating to security and defence".<ref>McBride p.196</ref>

The public and academic reaction to the decision was a negative one; "The House of Lords' decision has been met with consternation by most commentators. One can readily understand why".<ref name=p1/> Academic Thomas Poole considers that the House of Lords failed in their duty as members of the judiciary; "where old principles no longer fit contemporary constitutional and moral standards, why should we follow them? Surely the judicial task is to rework things like neo-imperial texts and outdated legal attitudes to the prerogative in order to cure obvious injustices and to vindicate a modern conception of the rule of law".<ref name=p1>Poole (2010) p.153</ref> Margit Cohn, senior lecturer at [[Hebrew University]], agrees, writing on the legitimate expectation issue that "It is difficult to accept that a public statement made by a Secretary of State, followed by the promulgation of an order that removed the previous prohibition to return, could not have created at least some sort of expectation".<ref>Cohn (2009) p.265</ref> The case is described as an "unfortunate regression" from the [[Council of Civil Service Unions v Minister for the Civil Service|GCHQ case]], where judges were willing to debate legitimate expectation in a similarly politically sensitive situation.<ref name=c>Cohn (2009) p.266</ref>
