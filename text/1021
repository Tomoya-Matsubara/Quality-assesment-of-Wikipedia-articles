The '''Common Treecreeper''', ''Certhia familiaris'', is a small [[passerine]] [[bird]] also known as the '''Eurasian Treecreeper''', or (in the [[British Isles]] where it is the only member of its genus) just '''Treecreeper'''. It is very similar to other [[Certhia|treecreeper]]s, and has a curved bill, patterned brown upperparts, whitish underparts, and long stiff tail feathers which help it creep up tree trunks. It can be most easily distinguished from the very similar [[Short-toed Treecreeper]], which shares much of its [[Europe]]an range, by its different song.

The Common Treecreeper has nine or more subspecies which breed in different parts of its range in temperate [[Eurasia]]. This species is found in woodlands of all kinds, but where it overlaps with the Short-toed Treecreeper in western Europe it is more likely to be found in [[conifer]]ous forests or at higher altitudes. It nests in tree crevices or behind bark flakes, and favours introduced [[Sequoiadendron|Giant Redwoods]] as nest sites where they are available. The female typically lays five or six pink-speckled white eggs in the lined nest, but eggs and chicks are vulnerable to attack by woodpeckers and mammals, including squirrels.

The Common Treecreeper is [[insectivore|insectivorous]] and climbs up tree trunks like a mouse, to search for insects which it picks from crevices in the bark with its fine curved bill. It then flies to the base of another tree with a distinctive erratic flight. This bird is solitary in winter, but may form communal roosts in cold weather.

==Description==
Similar in appearance, all treecreepers are small birds with streaked and spotted brown upperparts, rufous rumps and whitish underparts. They have long decurved bills, and long stiff tail feathers that provide support as they creep up tree trunks looking for insects.<ref name= Harrap/>

The Common Treecreeper is 12.5&nbsp;cm (5&nbsp;[[inch|in]]) long and weighs 7.0&ndash;12.9&nbsp;[[gram|g]] (0.25&ndash;0.46&nbsp;[[ounce|oz]]). It has warm brown upperparts intricately patterned with black, buff and white, and a plain brown tail. Its belly, flanks and vent area are tinged with buff. The sexes are similar, but the juvenile has duller upperparts than the adult, and its underparts are dull white with dark fine spotting on the flanks.<ref name= Harrap/> 

The contact call is a very quiet, thin and high-pitched ''sit'', but the most distinctive call is a penetrating ''tsree'', sometimes repeated as a series of notes. The male's song begins with ''srrih, srrih'' followed in turn by a few twittering notes, a longer descending ripple, and a whistle that falls and then rises.<ref name= Harrap/> 

The range of the Common Treecreeper overlaps with that of several other treecreepers, which can present local identification problems. In Europe, the Common Treecreeper shares much of its range with the Short-toed Treecreeper. Compared to that species, it is whiter below, warmer and more spotted above, and has a whiter [[supercilium]] and slightly shorter bill. Visual identification,  even in the hand, may be impossible for poorly marked birds. A singing treecreeper is usually identifiable, since Short-toed Treecreeper has a distinctive series of evenly spaced notes sounding quite different from the song of Common Treecreeper; however, both species have been known to sing the other's song.<ref name= Harrap/>

Three Himalayan subspecies of Common Treecreeper are now sometimes given full species status as [[Hodgson's Treecreeper]], for example by [[BirdLife International]],<ref name =Birdlife >{{cite web|title= Hodgson's Treecreeper ''Certhia hodgsoni'' |work= BirdLife Species Factsheet  |url=http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/search/species_search.html?action=SpcHTMDetails.asp&sid=32349&m=0 |publisher=[[BirdLife International]] |accessdate=2008-05-27}}</ref> but if they are retained as subspecies of Common, they have to be distinguished from three other South Asian treecreepers. The  plain tail of Common Treecreeper differentiates it from [[Bar-tailed Treecreeper]], which has a distinctive barred tail pattern, and its white throat is an obvious difference from [[Brown-throated Treecreeper]]. [[Rusty-flanked Treecreeper]] is more difficult to separate from Common, but has more contrasting cinnamon, rather than buff, flanks.<ref name= Harrap/>

The North American [[Brown Creeper]] has never been recorded in Europe, but an autumn [[vagrancy (biology)|vagrant]] would be difficult to identify, since it would not be singing, and the American species' call is much like that of Common Treecreeper. In appearance, Brown Creeper is more like Short-toed than Common, but a vagrant might still not be possible to identify with certainty given the similarities between the three species.<ref name= Harrap/>

[[Image:Boomkruiper1reversed.jpg|Short-toed Treecreeper, a confusion species in Europe|thumb]]
The Common Treecreeper  was first described under its current scientific name by [[Carolus Linnaeus|Linnaeus]] in his ''[[Systema naturae]]'' in 1758.<ref>{{la icon}} {{cite book | last=Linnaeus | first=C | authorlink=Carolus Linnaeus | title=Systema naturae per regna tria naturae, secundum classes, ordines, genera, species, cum characteribus, differentiis, synonymis, locis.

This species is one of a group of very similar [[Certhia|typical treecreeper]] species, all placed in the single genus ''[[Certhia]]''. Eight species are currently recognised, in two [[evolution]]ary lineages: a  [[Holarctic]] radiation, and a southern Asian group. The Holarctic group has a more warbling song, always (except in ''C. familiaris'' from [[China]]) starting or ending with a shrill ''sreeh''. Species in the southern group, in contrast, have a faster-paced trill without the ''sreeh'' sound. The Common Treecreeper belongs to the northern group, along with the [[North America]]n Brown Creeper, ''C. americana'', the Short-toed Treecreeper, ''C. brachydactyla'', of western Eurasia, and, if it is considered a separate species, Hodgson's Treecreeper, ''C. hodgsoni'', from the southern rim of the [[Himalayas]].<ref name=Tietze>{{cite journal ||last=Tietze |first=Dieter Thomas |coauthors= Martens, Jochen & Sun, Yue-Hua |month= |year= 2006|title= Molecular phylogeny of treecreepers (''Certhia'') detects hidden diversity|journal= [[Ibis (journal)|Ibis]] |volume=148 |issue= 3|pages= 477&ndash;488  |doi=10.1111/j.1474-919X.2006.00547.x |}}</ref>

There are nine to twelve subspecies of Common Treecreeper, depending on the taxonomic view taken, which are all very similar and often interbreed in areas where their ranges overlap. There is a general [[Cline (population genetics)|cline]] in appearance from west to east across Eurasia, with subspecies becoming greyer above and whiter below, but this trend reverses east of the [[Amur River]].

==Distribution and habitat==
[[Image:474px-Certhia familiariscroppedmirror.jpg|thumb|Central European bird feeding on a trunk]]
The Common Treecreeper is the most widespread member of its genus, breeding in temperate woodlands across Eurasia from [[Ireland]] to [[Japan]]. It prefers mature trees, and in most of Europe, where it shares its range with Short-toed Treecreeper, it tends to be found mainly in [[conifer]]ous forest, especially [[spruce]] and [[fir]]. However, where it is the only treecreeper, as in European [[Russia]],<ref name= Harrap/> or the [[British Isles]],<ref name= BTO/> it frequents broadleaved or mixed woodland in preference to conifers. 

The Common Treecreeper breeds down to sea level in the north of its range, but tends to be a highland species further south. In the [[Pyrenees]] it breeds above 1,370&nbsp;metres (4,495&nbsp;ft), in China from 400&ndash;2,100&nbsp;metres (1,315&ndash;6,890&nbsp;ft) and in southern Japan from 1,065&ndash;2,135&nbsp;metres (3,495&ndash;7,000&nbsp;ft).<ref name= Harrap/> The breeding areas have July [[isotherm]]s between 14&ndash;16&nbsp;<U+00B0>C and 23&ndash;24&nbsp;<U+00B0>C (57&ndash;61&nbsp;<U+00B0>F and 72&ndash;73&nbsp;<U+00B0>F).<ref name=BWP>{{cite book | last = Snow | first =  David  |coauthors= Perrins, Christopher M  (editors)| title = The Birds of the Western Palearctic concise edition (2 volumes) | publisher = Oxford University Press |year = 1998| location =Oxford | isbn = 0-19-854099-X }} 1411&ndash;1416</ref>

The Common Treecreeper is [[bird migration|non-migratory]] in the milder west and south of its breeding range, but some northern birds move south in winter, and individuals breeding on mountains may descend to a lower altitude in winter. Winter movements and post-breeding  dispersal may lead to vagrancy outside the normal range. Wintering migrants of the Asian subspecies have been recorded in [[South Korea]] and China, and the nominate form has been recorded west of its breeding range as far as [[Orkney]], [[Scotland]]. The Common Treecreeper has also occurred as a vagrant to the [[Channel Islands]] (where the Short-toed is the resident species), [[Mallorca]] and the [[Faroe Islands]].<ref name= Harrap/>

===Status===
This species has an extensive range of about 10&nbsp;million [[square kilometre|km<sup>2</sup>]] (3.8&nbsp;million [[square mile|square mi]]). It has a large population, including an estimated 11&ndash;20&nbsp;million individuals in Europe alone. Population trends have not been quantified, but the species is not believed to approach the thresholds for the population decline criterion of the [[IUCN Red List]] (declining more than 30% in ten years or three generations). For these reasons, the species is evaluated as Least Concern.<ref name = IUCN/>

It is common through much of its range, but in the northernmost areas it is rare, since it is vulnerable to hard winters, especially if its feeding is disrupted by an ice glaze on the trees or freezing rain. It is also uncommon in Turkey and the [[Caucasus]]. In the west of its range it has spread to the [[Outer Hebrides]] in Scotland, pushed further north in [[Norway]], and first bred in the [[Netherlands]] in 1993.<ref name = Harrap/>

==Behaviour==
===Breeding===
[[Image:Sequoi.westonbirt.600pix.jpg|thumb|Introduced redwoods are the preferred nesting trees where present.]]
The Common Treecreeper breeds from the age of one year, nesting in tree crevices or behind bark flakes.<ref name =BTO/> Where present, the introduced North American [[Sequoiadendron|Giant Redwood]] is a favourite nesting tree, since a nest cavity can be easily hollowed out in its soft bark.<ref name= Cocker >{{cite book | last = Cocker | first = Mark | coauthors= Mabey, Richard  |title = Birds Britannica | year = 2005 |location=London | publisher = Chatto & Windus | isbn = 0-7011-6907-9}} 394</ref> Crevices in buildings or walls are sometimes used, and artificial nest boxes or flaps may be preferred in coniferous woodland.<ref name=Harrap/> The nest has a base of twigs, pine needles, grass or bark, and a lining of finer material such as feathers, wool, moss, [[lichen]] or spider web.

In Europe, the typical clutch of 5&ndash;6 eggs is laid between March and June, but in Japan 3&ndash;5 eggs are laid from May to July.<ref name=Harrap/> The eggs are white with very fine pinkish speckles mainly at the broad end,<ref name=Harrap/> measure 16&nbsp;x&nbsp;12&nbsp;mm (0.5&nbsp;x&nbsp;0.6&nbsp;in) and weigh 1.2&nbsp;g (0.04&nbsp;oz) of which 6% is shell.<ref name =BTO/> The eggs are incubated by the female alone for 13<U+2013>17&nbsp;days until the [[altricial]] downy chicks hatch; they are then fed by both parents, but brooded by the female alone, for a further 15<U+2013>17&nbsp;days to fledging.<ref name =BTO/> Juveniles return to the nest for a few nights after [[fledging]]. About 20% of pairs, mainly in the south and west, raise a second brood.<ref name=Harrap/>

Predators of treecreeper nests and young include the [[Great Spotted Woodpecker]], [[Red Squirrel]], and small [[mustelidae|mustelids]], and predation is about three times higher in fragmented landscapes than in solid blocks of woodland (32.4% against 12.0% in less fragmented woodlands). The predation rate increases with the amount of forest edge close to a nest site, and also the presence of nearby agricultural land, in both cases probably because of a higher degree of mustelid predation.<ref name= Huhta>{{cite journal ||last= Huhta |first= Esa |coauthors= Aho, Teija; J<U+00E4>ntti, Ari; Suorsa, Petri; Kuitunen, Markku; Nikula, Ari; Hakkarainen Harri |month= February |year=2004 |title= Forest Fragmentation Increases Nest Predation in the Eurasian Treecreeper |journal= |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=148&ndash;155 | doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.2004.00270.x |}}</ref> The juvenile survival rate of this species is unknown, but 47.7% of adults survive each year. The typical lifespan is two years, but the  maximum recorded age is 8&nbsp;years and 10&nbsp;months.<ref name =BTO/>

===Feeding===
[[Image:A formica rufa sideviewmirror.jpg|thumb|''Formica rufa'', a competitor for arthropod prey]]
The Common Treecreeper typically seeks [[invertebrate]] food on tree trunks, starting near the tree base and working its way up using its stiff tail feathers for support. Unlike a [[nuthatch]], it does not come down trees head first, but flies to the base of another nearby tree. It uses its long thin bill to extract [[insect]]s and [[spider]]s from crevices in the bark. Although normally found on trees, it will occasionally hunt prey items on walls, bare ground, or amongst fallen pine needles, and may add some conifer seeds to its diet in the colder months.<ref name = BWP/> 

The female Common Treecreeper forages primarily on the upper parts of the tree trunks, while the male uses the lower parts. A study in [[Finland]] found that if a male disappears, the unpaired female will forage at lower heights, spend less time on each tree and have shorter foraging bouts than a paired female.<ref name= Aho>{{cite journal ||last= Aho |first= Teija |coauthors= Kuitunen, Markku; Suhonen, Jukka; Hakkari, Tomi; J<U+00E4>ntti, Ari |month= July |year=1997 |title = Effects of male removal on female foraging behavior in the Eurasian treecreeper |journal= Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology |volume= 41|issue=1 |pages=49&ndash;53 | doi =10.1007/s002650050362 |}}</ref> 

This bird may sometimes join [[mixed-species feeding flock]]s in winter, but it does not appear to share the resources found by accompanying [[tit (bird)|tits]] and [[Goldcrest]]s, and may just be benefiting from the extra vigilance of a flock.<ref name = BWP/> [[Formica rufa group|Wood ants]] share the same habitat as the treecreeper, and also feed on invertebrates on tree trunks. The Finnish researchers found that where the ants have been foraging, there are fewer [[arthropod]]s, and male treecreepers spent a shorter time on spruce trunks visited by ants.<ref name= Aho2>{{cite journal ||last= Aho |first= Teija |coauthors= Kuitunen, Markku; Suhonen, Jukka; Hakkari, Tomi; J<U+00E4>ntti, Ari |month= November |year=1997 |title = Behavioural responses of Eurasian treecreepers, ''Certhia familiaris'', to competition with ants |journal= Animal Behaviour |volume= 54|issue=5 |pages=1283&ndash;1290 | doi =10.1006/anbe.1997.0547 |}}</ref>

===Habits===
As a small woodland bird with [[crypsis|cryptic]] plumage and a quiet call, the Common Treecreeper is easily overlooked as it hops [[mouse|mouse-like]] up a vertical trunk, progressing in short hops, using its stiff tail and widely-splayed feet as support. Nevertheless, it is not wary, and is largely indifferent to the presence of humans.<ref name=Harrap/> It has a distinctive erratic and undulating flight, alternating fluttering [[butterfly|butterfly-like]] wing beats with side-slips and tumbles. Migrating birds may fly by day or night, but the extent of movements is usually masked by resident populations. It is solitary in winter, but in cold weather up to a dozen or more birds will roost together in a suitable sheltered crevice.<ref name=BWP/>
