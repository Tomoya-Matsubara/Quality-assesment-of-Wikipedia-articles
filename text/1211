'''''Cimolopteryx''''' (meaning "Cretaceous wing"<ref name="Holtz2010">Holtz, Thomas R.

Remains attributed to ''Cimolopteryx'' have been found in the [[Frenchman Formation]] of [[Saskatchewan]], the [[Lance Formation]] of [[Wyoming]], the [[Fox Hills Formation]] of [[Colorado]] and possibly the [[Hell Creek Formation]] of [[Montana]]. All date to the end of the [[Maastrichtian]] age, about {{period start|Paleogene}} million years ago.<ref name=hope2002>Hope, S. (2002). "The Mesozoic radiation of Neornithes."

(eds.), ''Mesozoic Birds: Above the Heads of Dinosaurs.''</ref> An additional specimen from the much earlier [[Dinosaur Park Formation]] of [[Alberta]] (mid [[Campanian]] age, about 75 million years ago) may belong to a new species of ''Cimolopteryx''.<ref name=hope2002/>

==Description and history==
''Cimolopteryx'' was a fairly small bird, with a maximum size about equal to that of a small [[gull]].<ref name=hope2002/> It is known almost exclusively from a number of ''coracoids'' (a bone in the shoulder girdle). These have a distinct enough anatomy, however, to allow it to be distinguished from other birds, and even for distinct species to be recognized. The first such coracoid to be found (specimen number [[Peabody Museum of Natural History|YMP]] 1845, in the collections of the [[Peabody Museum of Natural History]]) was first mentioned and informally named by paleontologist [[Othniel Charles Marsh]] in the footnote of an 1889 paper, but it was not validly described by him until 1892. Marsh also described a second species in the same paper, which he named ''Cimolopteryx retusa'', but this has since been recognized as a different kind of bird and reclassified as ''[[Palintropus retusus]]''.<ref name=hope2002/>

==Classification and species==
The classification of various species assigned to the genus ''Cimolopteryx'' is uncertain. As of a re-evaluation of the fossil remains in 2002 by Sylvia Hope, at most five species were recognized: ''Cimolopteryx rara'', ''C. petra'', ''C. maxima'', ''C. minima'', and one yet-unnamed species. ''C. rara'' and ''C. petra'' are almost identical, and were found in the same environments (the Lance and Frenchman formations), but differ in size, with ''C. petra'' smaller than ''C. rara''. In a 2009 review, Nicholas Longrich synonymized them as the same species, dismissing the size difference as possibly based on gender or growth stage.<ref name=longrich2009>Longrich, N. (2009). "An ornithurine-dominated avifauna from the Belly River Group (Campanian, Upper Cretaceous) of Alberta, Canada." ''Cretaceous Research'', '''30'''(1): 161-177.</ref> However, Longrich reversed his position following a 2011 analysis of Lancian birds, in which he and co-authors considered all four named species to be distinct.<ref name=longrichetal2011>Longrich, N.R., Tokaryk, T. and Field, D.J. (2011). "Mass extinction of birds at the Cretaceous<U+2013>Paleogene (K<U+2013>Pg) boundary." ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences'', '''108'''(37): 15253-15257. {{doi|10.1073/pnas.1110395108}}</ref> An additional, unnamed species is known from the much earlier Dinosaur Park Formation of Alberta. Also known only from a partial coracoid, its exact identity is uncertain.<ref name=hope2002/> ''C. maxima'' was about twice the size of ''C. rara'', but not enough of its anatomy is known to determine if it belongs to ''Cimolopteryx'' or a different genus.<ref name=hope2002/> As its name suggests, ''C. minima'' is one of the smallest species in the genus, about the same size as specimens referred to ''C. petra''. It may group together in the same "species group" as several indeterminate fossils possibly belonging to ''Cimolopteryx''.<ref name=hope2002/> Species ''C. minima'' and ''C. petra'' were transferred to the genus ''[[Lamarqueavis]]'' by Federico Agnolin (2010).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Federico L. Agnolin |year=2010 |title=An avian coracoid from the Upper Cretaceous of Patagonia, Argentina |journal=Stvdia Geologica Salmanticensia |volume=46 |issue=2 |pages=99<U+2013>119 |url=http://campus.usal.es/~revistas_trabajo/index.php/0211-8327/article/view/7642/8861}}</ref> Several collections of material that is similar to ''Cimolopteryx'' were referred to by Hope as undetermined species, which lack enough unique characteristics to be properly identified, and these may or may not belong to ''Cimolopteryx''.<ref name=hope2002/>

Hope regarded ''Cimolopteryx'' as a likely member of the modern bird group [[Charadriiformes]], which includes a diverse array of shorebirds. However, since all species are known only from parts of the shoulder girdle and wing bone fragments, this classification is tentative.<ref name=hope2002/>
