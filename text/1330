'''Lazare Ponticelli''' ([[December 7]], [[1897]]{{ref|art5|[A]}} &ndash; [[March 12]], [[2008]]) was, at the time of his death, the last documented surviving [[France|French]] veteran of [[World War I|the First World War]] and the last ''[[poilu]]'', or foot soldier, of its trenches. Born in Italy, he moved to France at age nine and lied about his age to join the [[French Army]] in 1914. However, upon the entry of Italy into the Second World War in 1915, Ponticelli was transferred to [[Italian Army|its army]] when authorities discovered his true ancestry. After World War I, he and his brothers founded the piping and metal work company "Ponticelli Fr<U+00E8>res" ("Ponticelli Brothers"), which assisted with [[World War II|the Second World War]] effort and is still in existence.

At the time of his death, Ponticelli was both the oldest living man born in [[Italy]] and the oldest man living in France. In his later years, he was critical of war in general and humbly kept his war awards in a shoe box. While he felt unworthy of the state funeral the French government offered him, he eventually accepted one, although he asked for the emphasis of the procession to be on the common soldier that died on the battlefield.

==Early life==
Ponticelli was born "L<U+00E0>zzaro" in Groppo Ducale near the village of [[Bettola]], [[province of Piacenza|Piacenza province]], in northern Italy.<ref name=tim>{{cite news |date= 2008-03-13 |title=Lazare Ponticelli: Veteran who fought for France and Italy in the First World War|url= http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article3540707.ece |publisher= ''[[The Times]]'' |accessdate= 2008-03-16}}</ref> Raised in the mountain village of Cordiani, he was one of seven children born to Jean and Philomena Ponticelli.

At the age of six, Ponticelli started working several jobs, including making clogs.<ref name=soir>{{fr}} {{cite news |first=Alain |last=Vincenot |date= 2008-03-13 |title=Lazare Ponticelli - C<U+2019><U+00E9>tait le dernier poilu |url= http://www.francesoir.fr/societe/2008/03/13/hommage-c-etait-le-dernier-poilu.html |publisher= ''[[L'Express]]'' |accessdate= 2008-03-28}}</ref> In 1906, at age nine, he saved enough money to buy a train ticket to Paris, which he considered "paradise".<ref name=tim/><ref name=exp/><ref name=soir/> Although he spoke no French, he found work as a chimney sweep in [[Nogent-sur-Marne]] and later as a [[paper boy]] in Paris.<ref name=tim/><ref name=bbc>{{cite news |date= 2008-03-12 |title= France's final WWI veteran dies |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7292109.stm |publisher= [[BBC News]] |accessdate= 2008-03-12}}</ref><ref name=iht>{{cite news |first=James |last=Kantner |date= 2008-03-12 |title= Lazare Ponticelli, 110, last 'poilu' of World War I trenches |url= http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/03/12/europe/veteran.php  |publisher= ''[[International Herald Tribune]]'' |accessdate= 2008-03-17}}</ref>

==World War I==
In August 1914, when he was 16, he lied about his age to join the 1<sup>st</sup> R<U+00E9>giment de Marche of the [[French Foreign Legion]], where his older brother C<U+00E9>leste was already serving.<ref name=tim/><ref name=bbc/> According to Ponticelli, France had done much for him, and serving was his way of showing his gratitude.<ref name=exp/> He served at [[Soissons]] in [[Picardy]], northeast France and at [[Douaumont]], near [[Verdun]].<ref name=lat>{{cite news |date= 2008-03-14 |title= Lazare Ponticelli, 110; France's last surviving World War I veteran |url= http://www.latimes.com/news/obituaries/la-me-ponticelli14mar14,0,7436915.story |publisher= ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' |accessdate= 2008-03-17}}</ref> Ponticelli worked at digging burial pits and trenches.<ref name=ap>{{cite news |title=Last French World War I Veteran Dies at 110 |url=http://www.nysun.com/article/72831 |work=[[Associated Press]] |publisher=''[[The New York Sun]]'' |date=2008-03-13 |accessdate=2008-03-19 }}</ref> On one occasion he reportedly rescued a German and a French soldier who had been wounded and caught on the front lines.<ref name=lat/>

With the entry of Italy into the First World War in 1915, Ponticelli was told he had to join the Italian Army and was discharged. At first refusing to leave, Ponticelli was escorted by two gendarmes to [[Torino]], where he joined a regiment of [[Alpini]] for service against [[Austrian Army|the Austrians]]. At his new post as a [[machine gun]]ner, Ponticelli was seriously wounded by a shell during an assault on an Austrian mountain position.<ref name=tim/> He described the event in an undated interview as "blood running through [his] eyes", but he "...&nbsp;continued firing despite [his] wound."<ref name=iht/>

After undergoing surgery, Ponticelli travelled back to his post.<ref name=tim/> His regiment once stopped firing for three weeks on the Austrians, whose language many of them spoke, and swapped loaves of bread for tobacco, taking pictures of each other.<ref name=eco>{{cite news |date= 2008-03-19 |title= Lazare Ponticelli |url= http://www.economist.com/obituary/displaystory.cfm?story_id=10875719 |publisher= ''[[The Economist]]'' |accessdate= 2008-04-09}}</ref>  In 1918 he was gassed in an Austrian chemical weapon attack that killed hundreds of his fellow soldiers.<ref name=tim/> Reflecting on war, he said: "You shoot at men who are fathers. War is completely stupid."<ref name=nyt/> and once questioned why he, or his regiment, had ever been fighting.<ref name=eco/> In one of his last interviews, Ponticelli stated he was amazed at his own survival.<ref name=abc>{{cite news |first=Lisa |last=Millar |date= 2008-03-18 |title= France honours last WWI veteran |url= http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/03/18/2193155.htm |publisher= [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC News]] |accessdate= 2008-03-24}}</ref>

==Work with Ponticelli Fr<U+00E8>res==

After being demobilised in 1920, Lazare founded a piping and metal work company with his brothers called "Ponticelli Fr<U+00E8>res" ("Ponticelli Brothers"). Located in the 13th [[Arrondissements of France|arrondissement of Paris]], it became profitable and well-known in its field, and still exists today.<ref name=tim/> At the time of his death it was reported that the company had 4,000&nbsp;employees.<ref name=nyt/>

During the [[World War II|Second World War]] Ponticelli, who became a French citizen in 1939, was too old for combat, although he supported the war effort by supplying soldiers with his products.<ref name=tim/><ref name=exp/> He moved his factory into an unoccupied zone when Germany invaded and occupied France. After [[Vichy France]] was taken over, he returned northwards and began working with the [[French Resistance|resistance]]. Ponticelli continued managing the company until his retirement in 1960.<ref name=tim/>

|quote = Today, I express the nation's deep emotion and infinite sadness. I salute the Italian boy who came to Paris to earn his living and chose to become French, first in August 1914 when he lied about his age to sign up at 16 for the French Foreign Legion to defend his adopted homeland. Then a second time in 1921, when he decided to remain here for good.

==Notes==

* [A] {{note|art5}} Ponticelli's date of birth is not known with certainty. Officially, it is [[December 7]], [[1897]], although this is likely a mistake. Most probably, it was recorded as [[December 27]], [[1897]] in the civil registry and the ''2'' was erased. Ponticelli's mother remembered giving birth on [[December 24]] and a snowstorm delayed any exit from the house for three days.<ref>{{fr}} {{cite news |first=Jean-Dominique |title=Un <U+00AB>rital<U+00BB> qui s<U+2019>est battu dans deux arm<U+00E9>es |url=http://www.liberation.fr/transversales/grandsangles/308039.FR.php |publisher=''[[L'Express]]'' |date=2008-02-05 |accessdate=2008-03-28 }}</ref>
