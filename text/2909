==Biography==
Born in Copenhagen, Fischer-Hansen did not take up painting until she reached her twenties. She spent a year at Emil Rannow's school of painting in Copenhagen (1927-28) before travelling to Italy to study painting. She also attended the graphic arts school in Nice. In 1929, her paintings of nudes were accepted at the Artists Autumn Exhibition (''Kunstnernes Efter<U+00E5>rsudstilling'').<ref name=kvinfo>{{cite web|url=http://www.kvinfo.dk/side/597/bio/661/origin/170/|title=Else Fischer-Hansen (1905 - 1996)|author=Marianne Barbusse

Fischer-Hansen's early work had been in the [[Realism (arts)|Naturalist]] style but in the 1930s, probably inspired by [[Henri Matisse]], it became increasingly [[abstract art|Abstract]]. Her ''Komposition'' exhibited in 1933 shows that she had already begun to use colour without distinguishable motifs. ''Onsdag'' (Wednesday) from 1941 consists solely of ovals, perhaps representing heads.<ref name=kvinfo/> Her paintings of the sea, light and air are created in a highly simplified abstract form, often with just a few strong colours on a light background.<ref name=weilbach/>

She also worked with other media including ceramics, weaving and stained glass. In 1971, she completed her glass mosaic decoration of [[Herlev Hospital]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Kunst_og_kultur/Billedkunst/Danmark_1910-55/Else_Fischer-Hansen|title=Else Fischer-Hansen|publisher=''Den Store Danske''|accessdate=12 November 2014 |language=Danish}}</ref>

Else Fischer-Hansen was married to the painter [[Egon Mathiesen]] (1907<U+2013>1976). 

==Awards==
In 1979, Fischer-Hansen was awarded the [[Eckersberg Medal]] and, in 1986, the [[Thorvaldsen Medal]].<ref name=weilbach/>
