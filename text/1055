The '''afterlife''', or '''life after death''', is a generic term referring to a "continuation" of [[existence]], typically [[spirituality|spiritual]], experiential, or [[ghost]]-like, beyond this world (eg. [[planes of existence]]), or after [[physical]] [[death]] (eg.  [[near-death experience]], [[reincarnation]]).  The major views in this area derive from [[religion]], [[esotericism]], [[metaphysics]], and [[science]]. Also there are those with opposite views, such as the [[materialism|materialist]]-reductionists, who state that the topic is supernatural, therefore doesnt really exist or is unknowable.

== The afterlife in different metaphysical models ==
<!-- This section supports the question presented on [[List of philosophical questions]], which links to here.  -->

In metaphysical models, [[theists]] generally believe some sort of afterlife awaits people when they die. [[Atheism|Atheists]] generally believe that there is not a life after death. However, other atheists like [[Buddhists]], tend to believe in an afterlife like [[reincarnation]] but without reference to [[God]].
[[Agnosticism|Agnostics]] generally hold the position that like the existence of God, the existence of supernatural phenomena, such as souls or life after death, is unverifiable and therefore unknowable. Some philosophies (i.e. [[posthumanism]], [[Humanism (life stance)|Humanism]], and often [[empiricism]]) generally hold that there is not an afterlife.

== Afterlife in modern science ==

Modern science, in general, either describes the universe and human beings without reference to a soul or to an afterlife; or tends to remain mute on the issue. [[Scientific method]] offers few tools for investigating the concepts.  One famous study, was conducted in 1901 by physician [[Duncan MacDougall]], who sought to measure the weight purportedly lost by a human body when the [[soul]] departed the body upon [[death]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Roach | first = Mary | title = Spook <U+2013> Science Tackles the Afterlife | publisher = W. W. Norton & Co. | year = 2005 | id = ISBN 0-393-05962-6}}</ref> MacDougall weighed dying patients in an attempt to prove that the soul was material, tangible and thus measurable. These experiments are widely considered to have had little if any [[scientific]] merit, and although MacDougall's results varied considerably from "21 grams," for some people this figure has become synonymous with the measure of a soul's mass.<ref>[http://www.snopes.com/religion/soulweight.asp Urban Legends] - Reference Page (Soul man).</ref>  The 2003 movie [[21 Grams]] was based on MacDougall's findings.  

Others, such as [[Francis Crick]] in 1994, have attempted a <U+2018>scientific search for the soul<U+2019>.<ref>{{cite book | last = Crick | first = Francis | title = The Astonishing Hypothesis <U+2013> the Scientific Search for the Soul | publisher = Touchstone Books | year = 1995 | id = ISBN 0-684-80158-2}}</ref> Lastly, we have the views of [[Frank Tipler]], who argues that [[physics]] can explain [[immortality]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Tipler | first = Franl, J. | title = The Physics of Immortality <U+2013> Modern Cosmology, God and the Resurrection of the Dead | publisher = Anchor | year = 1997 | id = ISBN 0385467990}}</ref> 

Some investigations have been conduced which failed to find evidence that out <U+201C>out-of-body<U+201D> experiences transcend the confines of the brain. One hospital, in order to validate claims of out-of-body experiences, for example, placed an LED marquee above its patients<U+2019> beds which displayed a hidden message that could only be read if one were looking down from above. As of 2001, no one who claimed near-death-experience or out-of-body experience within that hospital had reported having seen the hidden message. <ref>{{cite book | last = Alper | first = Matthew | title = The "God" Part of the Brain - a Scientific Interpretation of Human Spirituality and God | publisher = Rogue Press | year = 2001 | id = ISBN 0-9660367-0-0}}</ref>

==History of afterlife beliefs==
===ca 1500 BC: Egyptian===

Arriving at one's reward in afterlife is a demanding ordeal, requiring a sin-free heart and the [[spells]], passwords, and formulas of the [[Book of the Dead]]. One's heart is weighed against the feather of truth and justice (the Goddess Maat). If the heart is lighter than the feather then they may pass on, if it is heavier [[Ammut]] will devour them.

The afterlife played an important role in [[Ancient Egyptian religion]]. Egyptians believed that being mummified was the only way to have an afterlife. Without it, you would not have one. The believer had to act well and know the rituals explained in the [[Egyptian Book of the Dead]]. If the corpse had been properly [[embalm]]ed and entombed in a [[mastaba]], the defunct would relive in the [[Fields of Yalu]] and accompany the Sun god on its daily ride. If, during the [[psychomachia]], the souls of the defunct were found faulty, the demon [[Ammit]] would eat them. In addition to being virtuous, however, one also had to know numerous passwords, spells, and formulas to navigate the afterlife successfully. When the body died, its ka went to the kingdom of dead. Because of all the dangers, the book of the dead was placed in the tomb. While the body was in the fields of Yalu, Osiris demanded work as payback for protection he provided. Statues were placed in the tombs to serve as substitutes for the deceased.

===ca 1200 BC: Zoroastrian===
[[Zoroaster]] teaches that the dead will be resurrected and purified to live in a perfected material world at the end of time.

===ca 3000 BC: Hindu===
The [[Upanishads]] describe [[reincarnation]], or [[samsara]].

===ca 800 BC: Jewish===
Writing that will later be incorporated into the [[Hebrew Bible]] names [[sheol]] as the afterlife, a gloomy place where all are destined to go after death. The [[Book of Numbers]] identifies [[sheol]] as literally underground ({{niv|Numbers|16:31-33|Numbers 16:31-33}}), in the Biblical account of the destruction of the rebellious Korah and his followers.

===ca 700 BC: Greek===
In the [[Odyssey]], [[Homer]] refers to the dead as "burnt-out wraiths." An afterlife of eternal bliss exists in [[Elysium]], but it's reserved for [[Zeus|Zeus's]] mortal descendants.

===ca 400 BC: Greek===
In his [[Myth of Er]], [[Plato]] describes souls being judged immediately after death and sent either to the heavens for a reward or underground for punishment. After their respective judgments have been enjoyed or suffered, the souls are reincarnated.

===ca 200 BC: Jewish===
The [[Book of Enoch]] describes [[sheol]] as divided into four compartments for four types of the dead: the faithful saints who await resurrection in [[Paradise]], the merely virtuous who await their reward, the wicked who await punishment, and the wicked who have already been punished and will not be resurrected on Judgment Day.<ref>[[Harry Emerson Fosdick|Fosdick, Harry Emerson]]. A guide to understanding the Bible. New York: Harper & Brothers. 1956. page 276.</ref> It should be noted that the Book of Enoch is considered apocryphal by most denominations of Christianity and all denominations of Judaism.

===ca 100 BC: Jewish===
The book of [[2 Maccabees]] gives a clear account of the dead awaiting a future resurrection and judgment, plus prayers and offerings for the dead to remove the burden of sin.

===ca 100 AD: Christian===

[[Jesus]] and the [[New Testament]] writers of the [[Bible]] books mention notions of an afterlife and [[resurrection]] that involve ideas like [[heaven]] and [[hell]]. The author of [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] recounts the story of [[Lazarus and Dives|Lazarus and the rich man]], which shows people in [[Hades]] awaiting the resurrection either in [[bosom of Abraham|comfort]] or torment. The author of the [[Book of Revelation]] writes about [[God]] and the [[angels]] versus [[Satan]] and [[demons]] in an epic battle at the end of times when all [[souls]] are judged.  There is mention of ghostly bodies of past prophets, and the [[transfiguration]].

===ca 150 AD: Christian===
The [[Acts of Paul and Thecla]] speak of the efficacy of prayer for the dead, so that they might be "translated to a state of happiness."<ref>[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/thecla.html Acts of Paul and Thecla]] 8:5</ref> 

===ca 200 AD: Christian===
[[Hippolytus of Rome]] pictures [[Hades]] as a place where the righteous dead, awaiting in the [[bosom of Abraham]] their resurrection, rejoice at their future prospect, while the unrighteous are tormented at the sight of the "[[Lake of fire|lake of unquenchable fire]]" into which they are destined to be cast.

===382 AD: Eastern Christianity===
[[Gregory of Nyssa]] formulates belief in the possibility of [[purgatory|purification]] of souls after death.<ref>He wrote that a person "may afterward in a quite different manner be very much interested in what is better, when, ''after his departure out of the body'', he gains knowledge of the difference between virtue and vice and finds that he is not able to partake of divinity until he has been ''purged of the filthy contagion in his soul by the purifying fire''" (emphases added) - Sermon on the Dead, AD 382, quoted in [http://www.catholic.com/library/Roots_of_Purgatory.asp The Roots of Purgatory]</ref>

===ca 400 AD: Western Christianity===
[[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]] counters [[Pelagius]], arguing that [[original sin]] means that the unbaptized go to hell, including infants, albeit with less suffering than is experienced by those guilty of actual sins.

===ca 600 AD: Western Christianity===
[[Pope Gregory I]] repeats the concept, articulated over a century earlier by [[Gregory of Nyssa]] that the saved suffer purification after death, in connection with which he wrote of "[[Purgatory|purgatorial]] flames".

===ca 900 AD: Zoroastrian===
The [[Pahlavi]] text ''Dadestan-i Denig'' ("Religious Decisions") describes the [[particular judgment]] of the soul three days after death, with each soul sent to heaven, hell, or a neutral place ([[hamistagan]]) to await [[Judgment Day]]..

===ca 1100 AD: Western Christianity===
The noun "[[Purgatory|purgatorium]]" (Latin: place of cleansing<ref>[http://www.answers.com/topic/purgatory|"purgatory."] The Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition. Columbia University Press., 2003. Answers.com 06 Jun. 2007.</ref>) is used for the first time to describe a state of painful purification of the saved after death. The same word in adjectival form (''purgatorius -a -um'', cleansing), which appears also in non-religious writing,<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3D%2339625 Charlton T. Lewis, Charles Short, ''A Latin Dictionary'']</ref> was already used by Christians such as [[Augustine of Hippo]] and [[Pope Gregory I]] to refer to an after-death cleansing.

===ca 1200 AD: Jewish===
[[Maimonides]] describes the [[Olam Haba]] ("World to Come") in spiritual terms, relegating the prophesied physical resurrection to the status of a future miracle, unrelated to the afterlife or the Messianic era.

===ca 1200 AD: Norse===
The [[Prose Edda]] describes [[Hel (realm)|Hel]] as an unpleasant abode for those unworthy of [[Valhalla]], which is reserved for chosen warriors who die in battle.

===ca 1300 AD: Jewish===
The [[Zohar]] describes [[Gehenna]] not as a place of punishment for the wicked but as a place of spiritual purification for the souls of almost all mortals.[http://www.faqs.org/faqs/judaism/FAQ/06-Jewish-Thought/section-9.html]

===ca 1500 AD: Protestant===
[[Martin Luther]] denounces the doctrine of [[particular judgment]] as contrary to the [[Bible]], professing instead the belief that [[psychopannychism|the soul sleeps]] until [[Judgment Day]]. [[John Calvin]] denounces Luther's doctrine, writing instead that the souls of the elect rest in blessedness while awaiting the [[resurrection of the dead]].

===ca 1700 AD: Swedenborg and the Enlightenment===
During the [[Age of Enlightenment]], theologians and philosophers presented various philosophies and beliefs. A notable example is [[Emanuel Swedenborg]] who wrote some 18 theological works which describe in detail the nature of the afterlife according to his claimed spiritual experiences, the most famous of which is [[Heaven and Hell (Swedenborg)|Heaven and Hell]].

===ca 1800 AD to present===
Many [[New Age]] and [[Science Fiction]] beliefs become more popular.  The variety of beliefs is greatly increased and continues to change, or becomes more eclectic by mixing up beliefs of the past.

===1832 AD: Latter-Day Saints (Mormon)===
Revelation to [[Joseph Smith, Jr.]] and [[Sidney Rigdon]] concerning the Three [[Degrees of glory]]: Celestial, Terrestrial, and Telestial. ''[[Doctrine and Covenants]]'', Section 76.

===1918 AD: Latter-Day Saints (Mormon)===
President [[Joseph F. Smith]] of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] presents an elaborate vision of the Afterlife. It is revealed as the scene of an extensive missionary effort by righteous spirits to redeem those still in darkness - a spirit prison or "hell" where the spirits of the dead remain until judgement.  It is divided into two parts: Spirit Prison and Paradise. Together these are also known as the Spirit World (also Abraham's Bosom; see Luke 16:19-25). They believe that Christ visited spirit prison (1 Peter 3:18-20) and opened the gate for those who repent to cross over to Paradise. This is similar to the [[Harrowing of Hell]] doctrine of some mainstream Christian faiths. Both Spirit Prison and Paradise are temporary according to Latter-day Saint beliefs. After the resurrection spirits are assigned "permanently" to three degrees of heavenly glory (1 Cor 15:44-42; Doctrine and Covenants, Section 76) or are cast with Satan into Outer Darkness. (See Doctrine and Covenants, Section 76.)

===1945 AD: Christian fiction===
[[C. S. Lewis]] writes ''[[The Great Divorce]]''. In this work of fiction, spirits are continually escaping the possibility of [[Hell]] by choosing to go to [[Heaven]].



== Current religious beliefs about life after death ==
===Afterlife as reward or punishment===

Many religious traditions have held that the afterlife will resolve justice by assigning rewards and punishments to people according to how they lived their lives. This belief can be found throughout the ancient world, especially in Greek and Roman religion, as well as in various Asian religions. To the extent that the afterlife is a form of justice, it is usually restricted to humans, as other animals are not held responsible for their actions.

===Abrahamic religions===

In the monotheistic traditions of [[Judaism]] (see [[Jewish eschatology#The afterlife and olam haba (the "world to come")|Jewish views of the afterlife]]), and most sects of [[Christianity]], human [[soul]]s spend [[eternity]] in a place of [[happiness]] or [[torment]], such as [[Heaven]], [[Hell]], [[Purgatory]]  or [[Limbo]] (in Islam, Mizan, the instrument used by Allah to compare the things of good and bad in the afterlife by someone, compares everything a person has done, and it is believed limbo does not exist according to the Quran) . (in Judaism, "eternity" is not applicable to heaven, hell or limbo doesn't exist, and time spent in "purgatory" is definitely not eternal.)

=== Salvation, faith, and merit ===

Most Christians deny that entry into Heaven can be properly earned, rather it is a gift that is solely God's to give through his unmerited grace. This belief follows the theology of [[Paul of Tarsus|St. Paul]]: ''For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith--and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God, not by works, so that no one can boast.'' The [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustinian]], [[Thomist]], [[Martin Luther|Lutheran]], and [[Calvinist]] theological traditions all emphasize the necessity of God's undeserved grace for salvation, and reject so-called [[Pelagianism]], which would make man earn salvation through good works. Not all Christian sects accept this doctrine, leading many controversies on grace and [[free will]], and the idea of [[predestination]]. In particular, the belief that heaven is a reward for good behavior is a common folk belief in Christian societies, even among members of churches which reject that belief.

=== The dead as [[Angels]] in [[Heaven]] ===

In the informal folk beliefs of many Christians, the [[souls]] of virtuous people ascend to Heaven and are converted into [[angels]]. More formal Christian theology makes a sharp distinction between ''angels'', who were created by [[God]] before the creation of humanity, and ''saints'', who are virtuous people who have received immortality from the grace of God.

The [[Sufism|Sufi]] mystic [[Jalal ad-Din Muhammad Rumi|Rumi]] beliefs in different  [[Angel#Angels as a development step of the soul|development steps]] of the soul. The souls of virtuous people become angels and later they will return to God.

===Universalism===
<!-- needs some sort of source and spelling/grammar fix-->
Some sects, such as the Universalists, believe in [[universalism]] which holds that all will eventually be rewarded regardless of what they have done or believed. On that note, perhaps it is that on the other side of life, in a space we would call death, it would be more than likely that we know everything instantaneously, which would soon be followed by boredom. Perhaps it is because we would be bored in knowing everything that we come to here in life and take the present form of humanity, unknowing and curious, yet knowing that it is impossible to know everything without wondering "Why is the Universe Eternal" and failing to realize that it is Eternal to keep us Entertained with Possibility.

===Jehovah's Witnesses===
[[Jehovah's Witnesses]] understand [[Ecclesiastes]] 9:5 to preclude an afterlife:

For the living are conscious that they will die; but as for the dead, they are conscious of nothing at all, neither do they any more have wages, because the remembrance of them has been forgotten.

They believe that following Armageddon a resurrection in the flesh<ref>[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=acts%2024:15;&version=9; Acts 24:15 KJV]</ref> to an Edenic Earth<ref>''Insight on the Scriptures'' vol. 2 pp 574-6</ref> will be rewarded to '''both righteous and unrighteous'''(but not wicked) dead and that eternal death (non-existence) is the punishment for sin lacking repentance after Armageddon. Although those who are not dead when Armageddon occurs will be judged and possibly slain during Armageddon because of their potential regretless sins. They believe that death is the price for sinning (that is why most dead will be resurrected - they paid the price already).<ref>''Reasoning From the Scriptures'' pp 168-175</ref><ref>[http://www.watchtower.org/library/w/2002/7/15/article_02.htm Jehovah's Witnesses website on Hell]</ref>

===Deists===
During the European Enlightenment, many [[deist]] freethinkers held that belief in an afterlife with reward and punishment was a necessity of reason and good moral order.

===Punishment, retribution, and deterrence===
Over the centuries, concepts related to punishment have changed, and so have attitudes about punishment in the afterlife.
Earlier views of punishment as retribution have largely given way to a modern view of punishment as properly serving to deter or rehabilitate.
(See for example [[punishment]]; [[Cesare, Marquis of Beccaria]]; [[Jeremy Bentham]]; and [[Michel Foucault]])
At the same time, views of punishment in the afterlife have softened.
For example, [[Thomas Aquinas]] and [[Jonathan Edwards]] wrote that the saved in heaven will delight in the suffering of the damned.
Hell, however, doesn't fit modern, humanitarian concepts of punishment because it can't deter the unbeliever nor rehabilitate the damned.
Believers have come to downplay the punishment of hell.
[[Universalists]] teach that salvation is for all.
[[Jehovah's Witnesses]] and [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventists]] teach that sinners are destroyed rather than tortured forever.
[[Mormons]] believe that there are three possible [[degrees of glory]] in the afterlife, none of which are hellish.
In the 1990s, the [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] defined hell not as punishment imposed on the sinner but rather as the sinner's "self-exclusion" from God.

===Afterlife as reincarnation===

Another afterlife concept which is found among [[Hinduism|Hindus]], [[Rosicrucian]]s, [[Spiritism|Spiritists]], and [[Wicca]] is [[reincarnation]], as evolving humans life after life in the [[Physical plane|physical world]], that is, acquiring a superior grade of [[consciousness]] and [[altruism]] by means of successive reincarnations. This succession is conceived to lead toward an eventual [[salvation|liberation]] or [[born again|spiritual rebirth]] as spiritual beings. However, some practitioners of eastern religions follow a different concept called [[metempsychosis]] which purposes that human beings can [[transmigration of the soul|transmigrate]] into animals, [[vegetables]] or even [[minerals]]{{Fact|date=February 2007}}. One consequence of the Hindu and Spiritist beliefs is that our current lives are also an afterlife. According to those beliefs events in our current life are consequences of actions taken in previous lives, or [[Karma]].

[[Buddhism|Buddhists]], however, believe that [[rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]] takes place without a [[Atman (Buddhism)|self]] (similar to soul) and that the process of rebirth is simply a continuation of the previous life. The process of being reborn as any other being is based on your [[karma in Buddhism|karma]]. And from a Buddhist perspective, the current life is actually a continuation of the past life. If one dies with a peaceful state of mind this will cause fortunate karma to ripen and a fortunate rebirth as a human or god will follow. If one dies with a negative state of mind this will ripen negative karma and a lower rebirth such as an animal, hungry ghost or hell being will follow.

In [[Tibetan Buddhism]] the [[Bardo Thodol|Tibetan Book of the Dead]] explains the intermediate state of humans between death and reincarnation. The deceased will find the bright light of wisdom, which shows a straightforward path to move upward and leave the cycle of reincarnation.
There are various reasons why deceased not follow that light. Some had no briefing about the intermediate state in the former life. Others only used to follow their basic instincts like animals. And some have fear, which results from foul deeds in the former life or from insistent haughtiness. In the intermediate state the awareness is very flexible, so it is important to be virtuous, adopt a positive attitude and avoid negative ideas. Ideas which are rising from subconsciousness can cause extreme tempers and cowing visions. In this situation they have to understand, that these manifestations are just reflections of the inner thoughts. 
No one can really hurt them, because they have no more material body. The deceased get help from different [[Buddha]]s who show them the path to the bright light. The ones who do not follow the path after all will get hints for a better reincarnation. They have to release the things and beings on which or whom they still hang from the life before. It is recommended to choose a family where the parents trust in the [[Dharma (Buddhism)|Dharma]] and to reincarnate with the will to care for the welfare of all beings. 

Rosicrucians,<ref>[[Max Heindel]], The Rosicrucian Christianity Lectures ([http://www.rosicrucian.com/rcl/rcleng01.htm#lecture1 The Riddle of Life and Death]), 1908, ISBN 0-911274-84-7</ref> in the same way of those who have had [[near-death experiences]], speak of a [[life review]] period occurring immediately after death and before entering the afterlife's [[Plane (cosmology)|planes of existence]] (before the [[silver cord]] is broken), followed by a [[Last Judgment#Esoteric Christian tradition|judgment]], more akin to a Final Review or End Report over one's life.<ref>Max Heindel, [http://www.rosicrucian.com/zineen/death5.htm Death and Life in Purgatory] - [http://www.rosicrucian.com/zineen/death6.htm Life and Activity in Heaven]</ref>

Some [[Neopaganism|Neopagans]] believe in personal reincarnation, whereas some believe that the energy of one's soul reintegrates with a continuum of such energy which is recycled into other living things as they are born.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

[[Sikhs]] also believe in reincarnation. They believe that the soul belongs to the spiritual universe which has its origins in God. It is like a see-saw, the amount of good done in life will store up blessings, thus uniting with God.
A soul may need to live many lives before it is one with God.
