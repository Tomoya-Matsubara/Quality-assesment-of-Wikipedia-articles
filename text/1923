In the 1990s, the [[Bosnian Genocide]] and [[Kosovo War]], both of which involved the "mass murder of innocent Muslims," have been linked to Islamophobia.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Z. Husain & D. M.

===Bulgaria===
In 1989, 310,000 Turks left Bulgaria, many under pressure as a result of the [[communist]] [[Todor Zhivkov|Zhivkov]] regime's assimilation campaign (though up to a third returned before the end of the year). That program, which began in 1984, forced all Turks and other Muslims in Bulgaria to adopt [[Bulgarian name]]s and renounce all Muslim customs. The motivation of the 1984 assimilation campaign is unclear; however, some experts believe that the disproportion between the birth rates of the Turks and the Bulgarians was a major factor.<ref name=autogenerated1>Glenn E. Curtis, ed. Bulgaria: A Country Study. Washington: GPO for the Library of Congress, 1992</ref> During the name-changing phase of the campaign, Turkish towns and villages were surrounded by army units. Citizens were issued new identity cards with Bulgarian names. Failure to present a new card meant forfeiture of salary, pension payments, and bank withdrawals. Birth or marriage certificates would be issued only in Bulgarian names. Traditional Turkish costumes were banned; homes were searched and all signs of Turkish identity removed. [[Mosques]] were closed. According to estimates, 500 to 1,500 people were killed when they resisted assimilation measures, and thousands of others were imprisoned or sent to labor camps or were forcibly resettled.<ref>Library of Congress, [http://memory.loc.gov/frd/cs/bgtoc.html A Country Study: Bulgaria], Call Number DR55.B724 1993</ref>

{{See|Ghulja Incident|July 2009 <U+00DC>r<U+00FC>mqi riots|2008 Uyghur unrest}}

Many Uyghurs face religious persecution and discrimination at the hands of the [[Government of the People's Republic of China|government]] authorities. Uyghurs who choose to practice their faith can only use a state-approved version of the Koran;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rfa.org/english/news/uyghur/directive-08142008114700.html|title=Crackdown on Xinjiang Mosques, Religion|publisher=[[Radio Free Asia]]|date=14 August 2008|accessdate=27 April 2009}}</ref>  men who work in the state sector cannot wear beards and women cannot wear headscarves.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rfa.org/english/news/uyghur/hair-02202009174717.html|title=Kashgar Uyghurs Pressured To Shave|publisher=[[Radio Free Asia]]|date=20 February 2009|accessdate=27 April 2009}}</ref>  The Chinese state controls the management of all mosques, which many Uyghurs claim stifles religious traditions that have formed a crucial part of the Uyghur identity for centuries.<ref>Uyghur Human Rights Project</ref>  Children under the age of 18 are not allowed to attend religious services at mosques.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uhrp.org/articles/50/1/China-Bans-Officials-State-Employees-Children-From-Mosques/China-Bans-Officials-State-Employees-Children-From-Mosques.html|title=China Bans Officials, State Employees, Children From Mosques|publisher=Uyghur Human Rights Project|date=6 February 2006|accessdate=27 April 2009}}</ref>

However, the suppression of the Uyghurs has more to do with the fact that they are separatist, rather than Muslim. The government of China was willing to compromise with Hui (Chinese Muslim) activists when they staged public marches in Beijing and Lanzhou in 1989 to protest the publication of a book they deemed insulting to Islam, police protected the marchers and the government even agreed to the protestor's demands: the offensive book was banned and its authors were arrested. The Chinese government assisted them because Hui do not have a separatist movement, unlike the Uyghurs.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=VIWC9wCX2c8C&pg=PA581&dq=uyghur+girls+chinese&hl=en&ei=I9s8TOaDJsH98Aaz5MGRBw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5&ved=0CEIQ6AEwBDge#v=onepage&q=hui%20protest%20public%20marches%20book%20insulting&f=false|title=China: a history|author=Harold Miles Tanner|year=2009|publisher=Hackett Publishing|location=|page=581|isbn=0-87220-915-6|pages=610|accessdate=2010-06-28}}</ref>

In Tibet, the majority of Muslims are Hui people. Riots broke out between Muslims and Tibetans over incidents such as bones in soups and prices of balloons. Tibetans attacked Muslim restaurants. During the mid-March riots in 2008, Muslim shopkeepers and their families were badly hurt and some were killed when fires set in their shops spread to upstairs apartments. Due to Tibetan violence against Muslims, many Muslims have stopped wearing the traditional white caps that identify their religion. Many women now wear a hairnet instead of a scarf. Since the nearest mosque was burned down in August, the Muslims pray at home in secret. The Tibetan exile community is reluctant to publicize incidents that might harm the international image of Tibetans. The Hui usually support the Chinese government's repression of Tibetan separatism.<ref name="Demick">{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/jun/23/world/fg-muslims23fr|title=Tibetan-Muslim tensions roil China|last=Demick|first=Barbara|publisher=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=2010-06-28|deadurl=yes}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

The [[Islamic scarf controversy in France|Islamic headscarf ban]] at schools in 2004 has been accused of being Islamophobic.

[[Image:Babri rearview.jpg|right|thumb|The 16th-century [[Babri Mosque]] in India was destroyed by a mob of Hindu extremists in 1992.]]

In 1992, members of the [[Vishva Hindu Parishad]] and the [[Bajrang Dal]] destroyed the 430 year old [[Babri Mosque]] in [[Ayodhya]],<ref name=HRWCACV>[http://www.hrw.org/reports/1999/indiachr/christians8-03.htm The Context of Anti-Christian Violence]</ref> on the basis that the mosque was built over the birthplace of the Hindu deity [[Rama]] and that a Hindu temple existed at the site before the erection of the Mosque by demolishing the temple. The demolition was followed by [[Bombay Riots|riots in Bombay]].

The [[Sangh Parivar]] family of organizations has allegedly been involved in the [[2002 Gujarat violence]] they were allegedly responsible for encouraging attacks against Muslims in response to the [[Godhra train burning]] allegedly by Muslims in which 60 Hindus were killed.<ref>[http://hrw.org/reports/2002/india/India0402-02.htm#P335_60148 Human Rights Watch]</ref>  Subsequent riots led to the death of several hundred Muslims.

In the May 1999 [[Cuska massacre]], Serbian army, police, paramilitary and Serb volunteers from Bosnia in killed 48 Kosovo Albanian civilians, all men and boys. Some of the perpetrators were Kosovo Serbs while some others were criminals from Central Serbia released from prison for fighting in Kosovo.

===Myanmar===
{{Main|Persecution of Muslims in Myanmar|Rohingya people}}

Muslims are stereotyped in the society as "cattle killers" (referring to the cattle sacrifice festival of Eid Al Adha in Islam). The generic [[racist]] slur of "Kala" (black) used against perceived "foreigners" has especially negative connotations when referring to Burmese Muslims. The more pious Muslim communities which segregate themselves from the Buddhist majority face greater difficulties than those Muslims who integrate more at the cost of not observing Islamic personal laws.<ref name=autogenerated1 />

Muslims in Myanmar are affected by the actions of [[Islamic Fundamentalists]] in other countries. Violence in [[Indonesia]] perpetrated by [[Islamists]] is used as a pretext to commit violence against Muslim minorities in Burma. The anti-Buddhist actions of the [[Taliban]] in Afghanistan (the destruction of the [[Buddhas of Bamiyan]]) was also used as a pretext to commit violence against Muslims in Myanmar by Buddhist mobs. [[Human Rights Watch]] reports that there was mounting tension between the Buddhist and Muslim communities in Taungoo for weeks before it erupted into violence in the middle of May 2001. Buddhist monks demanded that the Hantha Mosque in Taungoo be destroyed in "retaliation" for the destruction of the [[Buddhas of Bamiyan]].<ref>[http://hrw.org/backgrounder/asia/burma-bck4.htm#P103_22688 http://hrw.org/backgrounder/asia/burma-bck4.htm#P103_22688] ''Hrw.org'' Retrieved on 24 May 2007</ref> Mobs of Buddhists, led by monks, vandalized Muslim owned businesses and property and attacked and killed Muslims in Muslim communities. This was followed by retaliation by Muslims against Buddhists. Human Rights Watch also alleges that Burmese military intelligence agents disguised as monks, led the mobs.<ref>[http://hrw.org/backgrounder/asia/burma-bck4.htm#P103_22688 Taungoo Violence (May 2001): Crackdown on Burmese Muslims (Human Rights Watch Briefing Paper, July 2002)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

The dictatorial government, which operates a pervasive internal security apparatus, generally infiltrates or monitors the meetings and activities of virtually all organizations, including religious organizations. Religious freedom for Muslims is reduced. Monitoring and control of Islam undermines the free exchange of thoughts and ideas associated with religious activities.<ref>[http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2001/5581.htm]. Accusations of "terrorism" are made against Muslim organizations such as the All Burma Muslim Union.[http://www.irrawaddy.org/aviewer.asp?a=5380&z=102]</ref>

The Muslim [[Moro people]] live in the [[Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao]] and southern provinces, remain disadvantaged in terms of employment, social mobility, education and housing. Muslims in the Philippines are frequently discriminated against in the media as scapegoats or warmongers.<ref>http://www.csmonitor.com/2005/0119/p07s01-woap.html</ref> This has established escalating tensions that have contributed to the ongoing conflict between the Philippine government, Christians and Moro people.

This has changed the population statistics in both countries to a significant degree, and has caused the gradual displacement of the Moros from their traditional lands.

In January 2010, a report from the [[University of Exeter]]'s European Muslim research centre noted that the number of anti-Muslim [[hate crime]]s has increased, ranging from "death threats and murder to persistent low-level assaults, such as spitting and name-calling," for which the media and politicians have been blamed with fueling anti-Muslim hatred. The Islamophobic incidents it described include: "Neil Lewington, a violent extremist nationalist convicted in July 2009 of a bomb plot; Terence Gavan, a violent extremist nationalist convicted in January 2010 of manufacturing nail bombs and other explosives, firearms and weapons; a gang attack in November 2009 on Muslim students at [[City University London|City University]]; the murder in September 2009 of Muslim pensioner, Ikram Syed ul-Haq; a serious assault in August 2007 on the [[Imam]] at [[London Central Mosque]]; and an arson attack in June 2009 on Greenwich Islamic Centre."<ref>{{Cite news|title=Media and politicians 'fuel rise in hate crimes against Muslims'|author=Vikram Dood|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=28 January 2010|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2010/jan/28/hate-crimes-muslims-media-politicians|accessdate=2010-04-04 | location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Dr. Jonathan Githens-Mazer & Dr. Robert Lambert|title=Islamophobia and Anti-Muslim Hate Crime: a London Case Study|publisher=[[University of Exeter]]|url=http://centres.exeter.ac.uk/emrc/publications/Islamophobia_and_Anti-Muslim_Hate_Crime.pdf|accessdate=2010-04-08}}</ref> Other Islamophobic incidents mentioned in the report include "Yasir, a young Moroccan," being "nearly killed while waiting to take a bus from [[Willesden]] to [[Regent's Park]] in London" and "left in a coma for three months"; "Mohammed Kohelee," a "caretaker who suffered burns to his body while trying to prevent an arson attack against Greenwich Mosque"; "the murder" of "[[Tooting]] pensioner Ekram Haque" who "was brutally beaten to death in front of his three year old granddaughter" by a "race-hate" gang; and "police officers" being injured "during an [[English Defence League]] (EDL) march in [[Stoke-on-Trent|Stoke]]."<ref>{{Cite news|title=Muslims in the UK: beyond the hype|author=Jonathan Githens-Mazer & Robert Lambert|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=28 January 2010|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/belief/2010/jan/28/muslims-media-hate-crimes|accessdate=2010-04-04 | location=London}}</ref>

In the aftermath of the [[Oklahoma City bombing]], many residents of Middle Eastern descent and African American Muslims became victims of the initial rage at "Muslim terrorists" as the initial news stories hypothesized. [[KFOR-TV]]'s coverage of the bombing informed viewers that a member of the [[Nation of Islam]] had taken credit for the bombing. Even though the network cautioned that it might be a crank call, it repeated the claim throughout the day's coverage. KFOR had also mistakenly identified an Iraqi resident as "John Doe 2", which subjected him to public harassment and caused the loss of his job. It was also reported that an Iraqi woman had a miscarriage after men shouting anti-Muslim epithets shattered the windows in her home.<ref name="Unfinished140">{{cite book|last=Linenthal|first=Edward|title=The Unfinished Bombing: Oklahoma City in American Memory|pages=77<U+2013>78|isbn=0-19-516107-6}}</ref> According to a report prepared by the [[Arab American Institute]], three days after the bombings, "more than 200 serious hate crimes were committed against [[Arab American]]s and [[American Muslim]]s.

While he added "Still, I must say that we feel that we must sooner or later stand up to Islam, and if we don't, it's not going to go away."

==Incidents on aircraft==
Some incidents with Muslim passengers on aircraft have given rise to the expression "[[Flying while Muslim]]".<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2006/US/11/21/passengers.removed/index.html Airline checks claim of 'Muslim while flying' discrimination] [[CNN]] November 21, 2006.</ref>
* On 16 August 2006 British passengers on board a flight from Malaga to Manchester requested the removal of two men of Asian descent from a plane. According to a spokesman for the [[Civil Guard]] in Malaga, "These men had aroused suspicion because of their appearance and the fact that they were speaking in a foreign language thought to be an [[Arabic language]], and the pilot was refusing to take off until they were escorted off the plane." A security sweep of the plane found no explosives or any item of a terrorist nature. [[Monarch Airlines]] booked the men, who were Urdu speakers, into a hotel room, gave them a free meal and sent them home on a later plane. The men later responded, "Just because we're Muslim, does not mean we are suicide bombers." The Islamic Human Rights Commission blamed "ever-increasing Islamophobia" related to the "war on terror" for the incident.<ref>[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.html?in_article_id=401419&in_page_id=1770&in_page_id=1770&ct=5&expand=true#StartComments Mutiny as passengers refuse to fly until Asians are removed] <U+2013> [[Daily Mail|Mail on Sunday]]. 20 August 2006</ref><ref>[http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/tm_objectid=17607948&method=full&siteid=94762&headline=exclusive--malaga-jet-mutiny-pair-s-shock-at-plane-ejection-name_page.html Exclusive: Malaga Jet mutiny pair's shock at plane ejection] <U+2013> [[The Daily Mirror]]. 23 August 2006.</ref><ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/airlines/story/0,,1854722,00.html Removal of men from holiday flight condemned]{{dead link|date=October 2010}}[[The Guardian]]. 21 August 2006</ref>

* On 21 November 2006, six [[imams]] were forcefully removed from a [[US Airways]] flight at [[Minneapolis St. Paul International Airport]] for security reasons. The event led to an outcry from Muslim organizations in America saying that what happened showed the growing prejudice against Muslims in America.<ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/21/AR2006112100687.html "U.S. Muslims outraged after imams kicked off plane"]{{dead link|date=October 2010}}, ''[[The Washington Post]]'', 22 November 2006.</ref> Investigations by the airline and police so far have reported that the airline and ground crews responded to security concerns properly in removing the men from the plane.<ref>[http://www.washingtontimes.com/national/20061205-112831-5995r.htm Probes dismiss imams' racism claim]</ref> See [[Flying Imams controversy]] for more details regarding this incident.
* In 2009 [[AirTran Airways]] removed nine Muslim passengers, including three children, from a flight and turned them over to the [[FBI]] after one of the men commented to another that they were sitting right next to the engines and wondered aloud where the safest place to sit on the plane was. Although the FBI subsequently cleared the passengers and called the incident a "misunderstanding," AirTran refused to seat the passengers on another flight, forcing them to purchase last minute tickets on another airline that had been secured with the FBI's assistance. A spokesman for AirTran initially defended the airline's actions and said they would not reimburse the passengers for the cost of the new tickets. Although the men had traditional beards and the women [[headscarves]], AirTran denied that their actions were based on the passengers' appearance.<ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/01/01/AR2009010101932.html?hpid=topnews 9 Muslim Passengers Removed From Jet]</ref> The following day, after the incident received widespread media coverage, AirTran reversed its position and issued a public apology, adding that it would in fact reimburse the passengers for the cost of their rebooked tickets.<ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/01/02/AR2009010201695.html Airline Offers Apology Over Detained Muslim Passengers]</ref>

==Video games==
* ''[[Muslim Massacre: The Game of Modern Religious Genocide]]'' is a controversial 2008 amateur [[shoot 'em up]] [[computer game]], as the aim of the game is to kill all Muslims that appear on the screen.  The game's creator took down the game's download site with a statement of apology on his personal website, claiming his original intention in releasing the game, to "mock the foreign policy of the United States and the commonly held belief in the United States that Muslims are a hostile people to be held with suspicion", had backfired and not been understood by the wider public, and that its release "did not achieve its intended effect and instead only caused hurt to hospitable, innocent people."<ref>[http://kotaku.com/5049613/muslim-massacre-creator-tucks-tail-apologizes 'Muslim Massacre' Creator Tucks Tail, Apologizes] Kotaku.com, 14 September 2008.
